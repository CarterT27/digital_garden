> “Solid work, steadily applied, gets you surprisingly far. The steady application of effort with a little bit more work, intelligently applied' is what does it” Yellow Highlight [Page 5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/P7MZGBUF?page=5&annotation=LXJK48KU)

> “If you believe too much you'll never notice the flaws; if you doubt too much you won't get started” Yellow Highlight [Page 5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/P7MZGBUF?page=5&annotation=TPNRE9WF)

> “Darwin writes in his autobiography that he found it necessary to write down every piece of evidence which appeared to contradict his beliefs because otherwise they would disappear from his mind. When you find apparent flaws you've got to be sensitive and keep track of those things, and keep an eye out for how they can be explained or how the theory can be changed to fit them” Yellow Highlight [Page 5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/P7MZGBUF?page=5&annotation=KRJTGZKL)

> “For those who don't get committed to their current problem, the subconscious goofs off on other things and doesn't produce the big result. So the way to manage yourself is that when you have a  real important problem you don't let anything else get the center of your attention - you keep your thoughts  on the problem. Keep your subconscious starved so it has to work on   your( problem, so you can sleep peacefully and get the answer in the morning, free.” Yellow Highlight [Page 5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/P7MZGBUF?page=5&annotation=FET2FB55)

> “bIt's not the consequence that makes a problem important, it is that you have a reasonable attack.” Yellow Highlight [Page 6](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/P7MZGBUF?page=6&annotation=R4BA2RR6)

> “The great scientists, when an opportunity opens up, get after it and they pursue it. They drop all other things. They get rid of other things and they get after an idea because they had already thought the thing through. Their minds are prepared; they see the opportunity and they go after it.” Yellow Highlight [Page 6](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/P7MZGBUF?page=6&annotation=3TFJJZFC)

> “He who works with the door open gets all kinds of interruptions, but he also occasionally gets clues as to what the world is and what might be important. Now I cannot prove the cause and effect  sequence because you might say, ``The closed door is symbolic of a closed mind.'' I don't know. But I can  say there is a pretty good correlation between those who work with the doors open and those who  ultimately do important things, although people who work with doors closed often work harder.” Yellow Highlight [Page 7](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/P7MZGBUF?page=7&annotation=FA5D59DL)

> “It ain't what you do, it's the way that you do it.” Yellow Highlight [Page 7](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/P7MZGBUF?page=7&annotation=SWJRI962)

> “The business of abstraction frequently makes things simple.” Yellow Highlight [Page 7](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/P7MZGBUF?page=7&annotation=GPP94Y2I)

> “It is a poor workman who blames his tools - the good man gets on with the job, given what he's got, and gets the best answer he can.” Yellow Highlight [Page 7](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/P7MZGBUF?page=7&annotation=45IAG5L4)

> “You must present it so well that they will set aside what they are doing, look at what you've done, read it, and come back and say, ``Yes, that was good.''” Yellow Highlight [Page 7](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/P7MZGBUF?page=7&annotation=X34A6TVJ)

> “There are three things you have to do in selling. You have to learn to write clearly and well so that people will read it, you must learn to give reasonably formal talks, and you also must learn to give informal talks.” Yellow Highlight [Page 8](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/P7MZGBUF?page=8&annotation=GGZBIXXN)

> “The technical person wants to give a highly limited technical talk. Most of the time the audience wants a broad general talk and wants much more survey and background than the speaker is willing to give” Yellow Highlight [Page 8](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/P7MZGBUF?page=8&annotation=PNB2NYKR)

> “You should paint a general picture to say why it's important, and then slowly give a sketch of what was done.” Yellow Highlight [Page 8](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/P7MZGBUF?page=8&annotation=A4PL27CX)

> “The people who do great work with less ability but who are committed to it, get more done that those who have great skill and dabble in it, who work during the day and go home and do other things and come back and work the next day. They don't have the deep commitment that is apparently necessary for really first-class work. They turn out lots of good work, but we were talking, remember, about first-class work. There is a difference. Good people, very talented people, almost always turn out good work. We're talking about the outstanding work, the type of work that gets the Nobel Prize and gets recognition.” Yellow Highlight [Page 9](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/P7MZGBUF?page=9&annotation=DXY3KG2T)

> “If you will learn to work with the system, you can go as far as the system will support you.” Yellow Highlight [Page 10](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/P7MZGBUF?page=10&annotation=ZLQEG47Z)

> “After all, if you want a decision 'No', you just go to your boss and get a 'No' easy. If you want to do something, don't ask, do it. Present him with an accomplished fact. Don't give him a chance to tell you 'No'.  But if you want a 'No', it's easy to get a 'No'.” Yellow Highlight [Page 10](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/P7MZGBUF?page=10&annotation=EF226PBL)

> “You should dress according to the expectations of the audience spoken to.” Yellow Highlight [Page 10](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/P7MZGBUF?page=10&annotation=Z4GXJMH2)

> “You should follow and cooperate rather than struggle against the!system all the time.” Yellow Highlight [Page 11](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/P7MZGBUF?page=11&annotation=3W5F3PM2)

> “I think you need to learn to use yourself. I think you need to know how to convert a situation from one view to another which would increase the chance of success.” Yellow Highlight [Page 11](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/P7MZGBUF?page=11&annotation=THRR5L8D)

> “If you read all the time what other people have done you will think the way they thought. If you want to think new thoughts that are different, then do what a lot of creative people do - get the problem reasonably clear and then refuse to look at any answers until you've thought the problem through carefully how you would do it, how you % could slightly change the problem to be the correct one.” Yellow Highlight [Page 13](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/P7MZGBUF?page=13&annotation=F48B38PU)

> “I believe that books which try to digest, coordinate, get rid of the duplication, get rid of the less fruitful methods and present the underlying ideas clearly of what we know now, will be the things the future generations will value. Public talks are necessary; private talks are& necessary; written papers are necessary. But I am inclined to believe that, in the long-haul, books which leave out what's not essential are more important than books which tell you everything because you don't want to know everything. ” Yellow Highlight [Page 14](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/P7MZGBUF?page=14&annotation=Y2AN3TAB)

> “Somewhere around every seven years make a significant, if not complete, shift in your field.” Yellow Highlight [Page 14](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/P7MZGBUF?page=14&annotation=7WDK2PHN)

> “When your vision of what you want to do is what you can do single-handedly, then you should pursue it. The day your vision, what you think needs to be done, is bigger than what you can do single-handedly, then you have to move toward management. And the bigger the vision is, the farther in management you have to go.” Yellow Highlight [Page 15](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/P7MZGBUF?page=15&annotation=QKU9A4MC)
