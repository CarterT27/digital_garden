> [!definition] Independent Events
> Two [[Event|events]] $A$ and $B$ are **independent** if $P(B\text{ given }A)=P(B)$, or equivalently if $$P(A\text{ and }B)=P(A)\cdot P(B)$$

> [!question]- Suppose we have a coin that is **biased**, and flips heads with probability 0.7. Each flip is independent of all other flips. We flip it 5 times. What's the probability we see 5 heads in a row?
> $$0.7\cdot0.7\cdot0.7\cdot0.7\cdot0.7=0.7^5$$
