> [!definition] One-To-One  
> A [[function]] $f:X->Y$ is **one to one** (or **injective**) if for every $y\in Y$ there is at most one $x\in X$ such that $f(x)=y$.  

**Remark:** "One to one" is a way to talk about the **uniqueness of solutions**.

*Example:* $f(x)=x^2$ is **not** injective. We can prove this by choosing any $b>0$. Solving for $x$ will give us $x=\pm \sqrt{ b }$, where $f(x)=b$ has more than one solution.

**Remark:** The *horizontal line test* is a way to visually check if a function is one to one. If you can draw a horizontal line that intersects a function at multiple points, the function is not one to one.
