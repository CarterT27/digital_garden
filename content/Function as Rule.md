> [!definition] Function as Rule
> A _function_ consists of three things: two sets, called the [[domain]] and the [[codomain]], and a rule that associates to any element in the domain exactly one element in the codomain.

**Remark.** Typically, we say "let $f:X\to Y$ be a function" to indicate that the domain is $X$, the codomain is $Y$, and the rule is $f$.

**Remark.** It may be possible to evaluate the function on every element of the domain, and every output (value of the function) must be in the codomain. But it is not necessary that every element of the codomain be a value of the function. We use the word "[[Image|image]]" to denote the set of elements in the codomain that are actually reached.

**Remark.** The words *function*, *mapping*, and *map* are synonyms, generally used in different contexts. A *function* normally returns a number. *Mapping* was first used in topology and geometry and has spread to all parts of mathematics. In higher dimensions, we tend to use the word mapping rather than function.
