# Exploring Data through Sound - Victor Minces  

Structured data vs. Unstructured data  
- Sound waves, signals  

Sounds are made of frequencies  

[Signal Generator](https://signalgenerator.sciencemusic.org/)  
[Spectrogram](https://spectrogram.sciencemusic.org/)  
[Pink Trombone - Vocal Cavity Simulator](https://imaginary.github.io/pink-trombone/)  

> [!note] Frequencies of the Human Voice  
> Fundamental Frequency around 80/100hz  
> Many, many harmonics (~100)  
> Filtered harmonics

## Data Sonification  

> [!note] Geiger Counter (1908)  
> The Geiger counter, one of the earliest examples of data sonification, converts radiation levels into audible clicks. It contains a small amount of gas that reacts to radiation, generating ions. Each ion produces a tiny amount of electricity, which is then converted into sound. More clicks indicate higher radioactivity.

> [!note] Cosmic Sonification  
> Bullet cluster, dark matter  
> Data showing dark matter are represented by the lowest frequencies, while X-rays are represented by the highest frequencies

## Machine Listening  

> [!note] Machine Listening  
> Machine listening is a fascinating field that enables machines to interpret and understand audio signals, beyond speech recognition including environmental sounds, animal calls, etc.  
> - Speech recognition: involves machines identifying and processing human speech to convert spoken words into text or commands  
> - Music Information Retrieval: analyzing music to extract information  
> - Environmental sound classification

> [!note] Machine Listening Process  
> - Data Collection  
> - Preprocessing  
> - Model training: often CNN or RNN  
> - Testing and refinement  

> [!note] Tools for Machine Listening  
> - TensorFlow and PyTorch  
> - LibROSA
