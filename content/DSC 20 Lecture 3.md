# Testing your code  
  
> [!note] Test-Driven Development  
> Write the test of a function before you write the function's body.  
> - A test will clarify the arguments, return, and behavior of a function.  
> - Tests can help identify tricky edge cases  
> Develop incrementally and test each piece before moving on.  
> - You can't depend on code that hasn't been tested.  
> - Run your old tests again after you make new changes.  
  
# Comments and Docstrings  
  
> [!definition] Comments: #  
  
> [!definition] Docstring: """ ... """  
> occurs as the first statement in a module, function, class, or method definition.  
  
> [!note] Difference between comments and docstrings  
> These descriptions are whawt is returned by Python when you type `help(object)`  
> Allows you to write doctests  
  
> [!note] Loops  
> **Loops** are used to access and modify information stored in lists(any iterable storage) and are used to repeat computations many times.  
> Two types of loops:  
> **For loop**: Usually is used when the number of reps is known.  
> **While**: Uses logical conditions, do not know the number of iterations.  
  
> [!note] Break Statement  
> Terminates the current loop and resumes execution at the next statement  
> The most common use for break is when some external condition is triggered requiring a hasty exit from a loop.  
> The break statement can be used in both while and for loops.
