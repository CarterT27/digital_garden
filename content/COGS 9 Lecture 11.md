# Data Visualization  
  
> [!note] Histograms  
> Information about a single set of numbers  
> Range of possible height values is easily visualized  
  
> [!note] Densityplot  
> Information about a single set of numbers  
> Demonstrates the distribution of the data (a smoothed version of a histogram)  
  
> [!note] Scatterplot  
> Relationship between two numerical variables  
  
> [!note] Barplot  
> Count of values within a categorical variable  
  
> [!note] Boxplot  
> Summary of numerical values across categories  
  
> [!note] Line plot  
> Quantitative trend over time  
  
> [!note] Grouped bar chart  
> Count information about two categorical variables  
  
> [!note] Stacked bar chart  
> Counts/proportions across categorical variables  
  
> [!note] Tables  
> Effective ways to display data summaries  
  
> [!note] Visualization best practices  
> - Choose the right type of visualization  
> - Label your axes  
> - Make sure the text size is big enough  
> - Make sure your numbers add up  
> - Make sure the numbers and graphics represent the data  
> - Make comparisons easy on your readers  
> - Use y axes that start at 0 for barplots  
> - Keep it simple  
  
> [!note] Color Considerations  
> Use color to highlight your point. And use it well.  
> - Be mindful when choosing colors.  
> - Gradients are for continuous values. Distinct colors are for categories.  
> - Color consistency helps viewers.  
> - Gray is your friend.  
> - Choose intuitive colors.  
  
> [!note] Other Considerations  
> - Allow viewer to make comparison top to bottom.  
> - Order rows logically.  
> - Order columns logically.  
> - Limit the number of rows and columns.  
> - Include informative labels.  
> - Be mindful of significant digits.  
> - Include a good caption.  
> - Include the source of data.  
> - Format table so it can be quickly understood.  
  
> [!note] Summary: Visualization Best Practices  
> 1. Choose the right type of visualization  
> 2. Use appropriate colors  
> 3. Label your axes  
> 4. Make sure everything is big enough.  
> 5. Make sure numbers add up  
> 6. Make sure plot reflects the data  
> 7. Make comparisons easy on the reader  
> 8. Don't deceive viewers  
> 9. Keep it simple  
  
> [!note] Why effective data communication matters  
> 1. It's often the only thing your coworkers/bosses see.  
> 2. It can set your work apart from others'.  
> 3. It helps show off the awesome stuff you've done.  
> 4. Cognitive load is a thing.  
  
## Exploratory vs. Explanatory  
  
Creating good visualizaitons is an iterative process  
  
> [!note] Exploratory visualization  
> - to take a quick look at your data  
> - generated during EDA  
  
> [!note] Explanatory visualization  
> - used in a presentation, report, or email to your company  
> - time-consuming to generate; reserved for plots that tell a story  
  
> [!note] Creating Visuals for Communication (aka Explanatory Data Visualizations)  
> 1. What's your point?  
> 2. How can you emphasize your point in a chart?  
> 3. What does the final chart show exactly?  
  
> [!note] What is your point?  
> Start by plotting some data (an exploratory plot)  
> Use the title to tell the viewer what conclusions are to be drawn  
> Use color effectively  
  
> [!note] How can you emphasize your point in a chart?  
> **Gray** is a data visualizer's best friend  
> Use boxes and text to highlight important points in your visualization  
  
> [!note] What does the final chart show exactly?  
> Make sure viewers know what the numbers represent and units  
> Directly label the data (rather than rely on a legend)  
> Always include your source  
  
> [!note] Aim to improve your data:ink ratio  
> Everything on your page should serve a purpose. If it doesn't, remove it! (Declutter)
