> [!definition] Multiplication Rule
> The **multiplication rule** specifies how to compute the [[Probability|probability]] of both $A$ and $B$ happening, even if all [[Outcome|outcomes]] are not equally likely.
> $$P(A\text{ and }B)=P(A)\cdot P(B\text{ given }A)$$

> [!question] What is the probability that the roll of a fair six-sided die is 3 or less and even?
> $$P=\frac{3}{6}\cdot \frac{1}{3}=\frac{1}{6}$$
