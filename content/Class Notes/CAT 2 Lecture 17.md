> [!note] Stimulus  
> A stimulus is any event or situation that evokes a response from an organism. In psychology and biology, stimuli can be anything in the environment that one can respond to. This can include physical stimuli (like light, heat, sound), as well as more complex inputs like social interactions and abstract concepts. Stimuli can lead to responses in both conscious and unconscious processes and are a fundamental concept in the study of behavior and perception. They play a crucial role in learning and conditioning processes, where an organism learns to associate a specific stimulus with a particular response.
