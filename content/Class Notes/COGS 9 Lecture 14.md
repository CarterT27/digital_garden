## Pillars of Effective Communication  

> [!note] Effective communication tells a story  
> A beginning  
> - provide context  
> - tell your audience what you're going to tell them  
> A middle  
> - show them  
> - tell them  
> An end  
> - remind them what you told them  

> [!note] When communicating, consider who, what, when, how  
> 1. Who  
> 	1. Who is your audience?  
> 	2. What is your relationship to the audience?  
> 2. What  
> 	1. What do you need your audience to know?  
> 	2. What do you want your audience to do?  
> 	3. What will your tone be?  
> 3. How  
> 	1. In what format will you communicate this to your audience?  
> 		1. Live presentation?  
> 		2. Written document?

## Effective Oral Communication  

> [!note] When presenting out loud...  
> - don't make slides with dense text  
> - use animation to build your story (not to distract)  
> - introduce your axes  
> - utilize your voice  
> - spend the time beforehand (attention to detail, practice)  
> - don't go over your allotted time  

## Effective Written Communication  

> [!note] When to cite your sources  
> You **DO** have to cite your sources when referencing the ideas, words, data, or information that is not your own.  
> You **do NOT** have to cite a source when a fact is easily observable or generally accepted.  
> When in doubt, cite.
