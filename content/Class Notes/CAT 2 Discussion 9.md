> [!note] Prompt Advice  
> - Prompt is asking: "Can the effectiveness of the '**aesthetic experience**' of art (including visual art, music, architecture, theater, cinema, etc.) be quantified?"  
>   - Aesthetic experience = being moved to a different emotional state than you were before viewing the artwork  
>   - Quantified = measured/tested  
> - **NOT** asking if the methods used to create the art can be quantified - we already know they can (i.e. color theory, music theory, etc.)  
> - Define what the aesthetic experience is  
> - Discuss what the purpose of quantification is and what sort of quantification measures you would or would not utilize  
> - Use all the information and don't selectively omit information to further your argument  
> - Use the active voice in academic writing  
>   - "I argue..."  
>   - "Ledoux and Pine claim that..."  
>   - "This evidence shows..."  
> - Include evidence from the course readings and lectures  
>   - Remember that the evidence you find may not be overtly "obvious"  
>   - Cite your evidence  
> - Be as specific as possible in your descriptions  
> - **NOT OUTSIDE RESEARCH IN CAT 2**
