# Emotions  

> [!question]- What are the emotions that you've felt today since you woke up?  

> [!note] German Emotions  
> Hygge (Cozy) - The feeling of peacefulness when you are at home  
> SchadenFreude - The joy you take in your enemy's misery

> [!note] Emotional Misconceptions  
> - Emotions are Conscious Homunculi  
>   - The brain is a machine with a little person inside. This way we can say me anger made me do it.  
> - Humans being are entirely emotional beings  
>   - Top-Down emotional regulation  
>   - Development of prefrontal cortex allows us to think logically, without being solely under the control of our emotions  
> - There are a few primary emotions  
>   - Primary emotions are irreducible. Essentialism, joy, and fear cannot mix. Primary emotions correspond to those for which we have names for in English. Are emotions limited to the words we have for them? What about other cultures?  
> - Emotions are rigidly triggered by external stimuli  
>   - Emoting is just like a reflex. What determines whether an external stimulus will evoke an emotion or not? What determines what kind of emotion is evoked? What do development and learning play in determining an organism's response to a given stimulus?  

> [!note] Primary Emotions  
> - Emotions control our behavior  
>   - If certain emotions always caused certain behavior it would be very simple to deduce someone's emotions by looking at their behavior. How can we identify emotions in the absence of behavior?  
>   - Pavlovian Conditioning  
> - Different emotions are located in different discrete brain regions  
>   - Different emotions must correspond to anatomically distinct modules, just like each emotion is represented by a different person. Fear is not in the amygdala but involves amygdala. Specificity exists but there are no macroscopic brain structures dedicated to one single emotion.  

> [!note] What is EMOTION then?  
> Emotions are internal brain states that cause observable external changes in behaviopr, observable internal physiological changes in the state of the body, changes in other mental states and under some conditions and in some species changes in what we are consciously aware of. - Adolphs and Anderson, 2014  
> Emotions are specific and consistent collections of physiological repsonses triggered by certain brain systems when the organism represents certain objects ...  

> [!note] Emotion / Feeling and Mood  
> Emotion is a shorter duration - comes and goes within 45 seconds  
> Mood is a longer duration  

> [!note] Valence and Arousal  
> **Emotional Valence**:  
> the value associated with a stimulus as expressed on a continuum from *pleasant* to *unpleasant* or from attractive to aversive. For example, happiness is typically characterized by pleasant valence and relatively high arousal, whereas sadness or depression is typically characterized by unpleasant valence and relatively low arousal. (association of psychology)  
> Pleasant vs. unpleasant activation  
> **Emotional Arousal**:  
> Arousal is the physiological state of being awoken or of sense organs stsimulated to a point of perception.
