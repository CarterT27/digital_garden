**Probability distribution of a statistic**  
The value of a statistic is random, because it depends on a random [[Sample]].  
The probability distribution of the statistic is also known as its [[Sample Distribution|sampling distribution]].  
This describes all possible values of the [[Statistic]] and all the corresponding [[Probability|probabilities]].
