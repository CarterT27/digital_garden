# Major Assignment 2  

Art = Architecture + Design + Art  
Art + Playable media + Moving image + Performance arts  

> [!note] Breaking down the prompt  
> Can a meaningful framework be developed for understanding art through the lens of science?  
> Can the effectiveness of the "aesthetic experience" of art (including visual art, music, architecture, theater, cinema, etc.) be quantified?  
> Aesthetic experience = being moved to a different emotional state than you were before viewing the artwork  
> Quantified = measured/tested  

Point A vs. Point B, change in emotional, mental, physiological state  
- King's speech  
- Transpotting  

> [!note] Tips for Prompt  
> - You can argue YES or NO, as long as you have evidence to support your claim.  
> - Consider the scientific tests in neuroscience we have discussed in lecture  
> - Readings later this quarter may offer more evidence  
> - You can use experiments and tests you have learned about from prior knowledge, without digging into outside research just for this assignment.  
> - Consider what the purpose of "quantifying" and having experiments in the first place  
> - You **can** discuss a personal experience with an art piece, as long as you include evidence
