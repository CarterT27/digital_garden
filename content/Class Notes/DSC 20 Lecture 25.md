# Mutable Data  

> [!note] Mutability  
> - **Immutable**: the value of the object cannot be changed  
>   - Integers, floats, booleans  
>   - Strings, tuples  
> - **Mutable**: the value of the object can be changed:  
>   - Lists  
>   - Dictionaries  

> [!note] Mutation can happen within a function call  
> A function can change the value of any object within its scope  

> [!note] From Value to Storage  
> - A variable assigned a compound value (object) is a reference (memory address) to that object  
> - Mutable objects can be changed but the variable(s) still refer to it
