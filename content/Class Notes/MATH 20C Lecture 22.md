# 14.7 Optimization  

> [!note] Global Extrema  
> The minimum and maximum values of a function $f$ on a given domain $D$ are called global extreme values.  

> [!definition] Bounded Domain  
> A domain $D$ is **bounded** if it is contained in a disk of radius $M$ centered at the origin for some $M>0$.  

> [!definition] Closed Domain  
> A domain $D$ is **closed** if it contains all boundary points.  

> [!note] Theorem  
> Let $f(x,y)$ be a **continuous** function on a closed, bounded domain $D$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$. Then  
> 1. $f(x,y)$ takes on both a global max and global min value in $D$  
> 2. The extreme values occur either at **critical points** in the interior of $D$ or at points on the boundary of $D$  

> [!note] Steps for determining the global extreme values of a function  
> 0. Check if $D$ is bounded and closed and $f(x,y)$ is continuous  
> 1. Check the interior critical points  
> 2. Check the boundary for special points  
> 3. To find the global max/min of $f$ on $D$ we compare the z-values of  
>   - interior critical points  
>   - special points on the boundary
