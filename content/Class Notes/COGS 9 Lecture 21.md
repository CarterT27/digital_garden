> [!note] What to do about bias  
> 1. Anticipate and plan for potential biases before model generation. Check for bias after.  
> 2. Use machine learning to improve lives rather than for punitive purposes.  
> 3. Revisit your models. Update your algorithms.  
> 4. You are responsible for the algorithms you put out into the world, unintended consequences and all.  

# Deep Learning  

> [!note] How is deep learning different from classical ML?  
> - Machine Learning involves feature extraction/selection (manually picking parts of your data that you want to run an ML algorithm on)  
> - Machine learning involves trying different algorithms to find out which works best (dependent on the data you have/are using)  
> - Most algorithms treat the data linearly  
>  
> - Deep learning does feature selection for you, just pass in all the data (great for high-dimensional data)  
> - 1 type of neural network tends to work for all sorts of data; small tweaks (rather than changing the whole algorithm)  
> - Treats data points nonlinearly; algorithm will learn nonlinear function (i.e. curve) to classify the data  

> [!note] Where do we encounter DL?  
> - Neural nets used to solve many problems today  
>   - Autonomous driving  
>   - fintech/stock market predictions  
>   - Google search results, google ads, Google Assistant, Siri, Alexa, etc.  
>   - FB NewsFeed, Recommendations on YouTube, Amazon, Netflix, Spotify, TikTok, etc.  
>   - Healthcare, Cancer Diagnostics, Genetics  

> [!question] If deep learning is so great, why don't we *only* use neural networks and deep learning for everything?
