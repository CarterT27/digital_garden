Reminders  
- You are not using any outside research from your assignments in CAT 2, the only evidence should be from the artwork and class materials  
- You should focus on HOW the sense you describe is evoked by the artwork, not the deeper "meaning" of the artwork  
- Be as specific as possible in your descriptions: naming the colors, why something has a certain texture, etc.  
- Your introduction and conclusion should be longer than 3 sentences  
- Final draft will be 750-1000 words  

> [!note] The 3 Ex's  
> Exposition sentences state a purpose or claim. Such sentences might be thesis statements, topic sentences, or sub-claims - any sentences that state your point.  
> Example sentences provide evidence of a specific exposition sentence. Such sentences might be summaries, paraphrases, quotations, anecdotes, or descriptions (among others). Generally speaking, any time you engage with someone else's ideas, you are providing evidence.  
> Explanation sentences tell your reader how example sentences prove the exposition sentence is true, or tell teh reader how a paragraph connects to the main argument of the whole essay. Such sentences are interpretive (explain a quotation), synthesis (show how different ideas or details are related), or analytical (show how evidence provides unexpected insights or new information, etc.)  
> You can determine how well you have developed your essays by highlighting each of the sentences in your body paragraphs according to the color code above.
