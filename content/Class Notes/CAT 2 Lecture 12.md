# Pina - Movie Notes  

Opening scene people talking about the four seasons and walking around in a line  

Second Scene girls in dresses dancing on a dirt stage with a red object and shirtless boys. Then a dude puts his face in the red scarf, girl gets a red dress  

Third scene on grass outside tihs time, guy is in suit and girl is in red dress. She keeps trying to fall on her face and he catches her.  

Cut scenes with commentary have shots of people not speaking, but their voices are in the background.  

Guy dancing with his arms on an escalator.  

What's with all the people falling onto the floor?  

Dude stacking chairs and people crawling through them  

Scene with girl on moving train with light and her shadow behind her on the wall, AND THEN SHE FALLS OVER AGAIN  

I give up
