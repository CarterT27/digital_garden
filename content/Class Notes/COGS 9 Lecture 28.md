# The Future of Data Science  

## Where We Are Today  

> [!note] Advice from Vicki Boykis - ML Engineer at Mozilla AI  
> 1. Learn SQL  
> 2. Learn a programming language extremely well and learn programming concepts  
> 3. Learn how to work in the cloud  
> 4. This stuff is really hard for everyone, and there are a million things it seems like you have to know. Don't get discouraged.  

## Where are we going?  

What you and your friends/colleagues would do is not always reflective of what the world thinks or would do.  

## Algorithms are fragile & Powerful  

## Algorithms often affect our privacy  

> [!note] What to learn outside of class going forward  
> 1. Start working with AWS (S3 buckets, EC2 instances, EBS drives)  
> 2. Learn how to use Linux and the terminal (commands like `pwd`, `cd`, `ls`,...)  
> 3. Get comfortable with git and github  
> 4. Get good at (python or R), SQL, and understand how a RDMS works  
> 5. Learn how the web works (HTTP status codes, front vs back end, how do web apps and websites work, what is the web $\to$ ruby on rails or python flask)  
> 6. Begin working on a small project that interests you  
>   - Grab some data and just start to play with it, learn to make plots, massage the data, build simple models and analyze them. TIME AT KEYBOARD $\to$ reps, reps, reps...  
> 7. Linear Regression, Decision Trees, PCA, Naiva Bayes, General linear models  
> 8. Neural networks $\to$ pytorch and or keras CPU first then GPU + cloud  
> 9. Docker Containers  
> 10. Begin to discover and learn about a 'domain' i.e. healthcare, finance, etc.

If you remember anything from this course...  
Ethics should always be a priority in your work.  
Data wrangling is a puzzle and a big part of the job. When done well, it's not boring!  
Data science is a competitive, but rewarding field. You have a change to make a big difference!  
Your grade in this course is probably **not** predictive of future success.
