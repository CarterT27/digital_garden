# Complexity  

Measuring efficiency (how long it takes your program to run)  

> [!note] Algorithmic Complexity  
> Algorithmic complexity is a very important topic in computer science. Knowing  
> the complexity of algorithms allows you to answer questions such as:  
> - How long will a program run on an input?  
> - How much space will it take?  
> - Is the problem even solvable?  
> - What data structure (ADT) to choose.  

> [!note] Complexity  
> - How well a computer algorithm scales as the amount of data increases.  
> - We need a way to compare algorithms. So we will learn how to create special  
>   categories (runtime classes), add algorithms to these categories and  
>   compare them instead.  

> [!note] Running Time  
> - Best case: the last amount of time possible  
> - Worst case: the most amount of time possible  
> - Average case  

> [!note] Time Complexity  
> A way of showing how the runtime of function increases as the size of the  
> input increases

## Comparing Orders of Growth  

> [!note] Properties of Orders of Growth  
> - Constants: Constant terms do not affect the order of growth of a process.  
> - Logarithms: The base of a logarithm does not affect the order of growth of a  
>   process.  
> - Lower-order terms: The fastest-growing part of the computation dominates the  
>   total.
