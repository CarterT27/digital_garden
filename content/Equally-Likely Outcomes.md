> [!definition] Equally-Likely Outcomes
> If all [[Outcome|outcomes]] in [[Event|event]] $A$ are **equally-likely**, then the [[Probability|probability]] of $A$ is $$P(A)=\frac{\text{\# of outcomes satisfying }A}{\text{total \# of outcomes}}$$  

The probability of seeing exactly 2 heads if we flip a fair coin 3 times is $$\frac{\text{\# of heads}}{\text{\# of flips}}=\frac{2}{3}=0.6\bar{6}=66.\bar{6}\%$$
