> [!definition] Neuroarts
> Neuroarts, or neuroaesthetics, is an interdisiplinary field that examines the intersection of art and brain science. It explores how the brain processes and responds to various art forms and investigates the neurological basis of creativity. This field also looks at the therapeutic benefits of art in mental health and cognitive rehabilitation. Combining insights from neuroscience, psychology, and the arts, neuroarts seeks to understand the profound impact of artistic experiences on the human brain and behavior.

> [!definition] Aesthetics
> Aesthetics is a branch of philosophy that deals with the nature of beauty, art, and taste, and with the creation and appreciation of beauty. It involves the study of subjective and sensori-emotional values, sometimes called judgements of sentiment and taste. Aesthetics coveres a variety of topics, such as the philosophical understanding of how and why things are considered attractive or unattractive, the nature and appreciation of art, and the experiences of beauty.
> The Philosophy of Art: Exploring what art is, what makes something a work of art, and the nature of artistic expression.
> Judgement of Taste: Understanding how and why we find certain things beauftiful or aesthetically pleasing, and the cultural and individual differences in these judgements.
> Perception of Beauty: Investigating the criteria and standards used to discern beauty in various forms, whether in art, nature, or everyday objects.
> Emotional and Sensorial Experience: Examining how aesthetic experiences evoke emotions and engage our sensory perceptions.

> [!definition] Neuroaesthetics
> Neuroaesthetics is a branch of neuroscience that studies the neural basis of aesthetic experiences and artistic creativity. It examines how the brain perceives, intterprets, and responds to various forms of art, such as visual arts, music, dance, and literature. 

> [!definition] Neuroscience
> Neuroscience is the scientific study of the nervous system, encompassing its structure, function, development, genetics, biochemistry, physiology, pharmacology, and pathology. It seeks to understand how the brain and the rest of the nervous sytem operate and how they influence behavior, cognition, and emotion.

> [!note] Edwin Smith Surgical Papyrus
> The earliest recorded reference to the brain (17th century BC)

> [!note] Aristotle
> In the fourth century B.C., Aristotle considered the brain to be a secondary organ that served as a cooling agent for the heart and a place in which spirit circulated freely

> [!note] Galen
> Building upon this research in the next century, the Roman physician Galen concluded that mental activity occurred in the brain rather than the heart, as Aristotle had suggested. His observations of the effects of brain injuries on mental activity formed an important practical basis for his conclusions. Galen concluded that the brain was the seat of the animal soul - one of three "souls" foundin the body, each associated with a principal organ. The brain was a cold, moist organ formed with sperm.

> [!definition] Phrenology - Franz Joseph Gall
> Phrenology is a discredited 19th-century theory that proposed the shape and size of the skull could determine a person's character and mental abilities. Developed by Franz Joseph Gall, it suggested that different brain areas corresponded to specific personality traits, which were reflected in bumps on thee skull. Although now recognized as pseudoscience, phrenology was an early attempt to link brain regions with specific functions, influencing the development of neuroscience despite its flawed premises.
