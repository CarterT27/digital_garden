> [!definition] Autonomous Differential Equations
> Differential equations of the form $\frac{dy}{dt}=f(y)$ are called **autonomous**.
> or an autonomous equation, the solutions y(t) = yi, where yi’s are the  
> roots of f (t), are called equilibrium.  
> - If an equilibrium repels neighboring solutions as t → ∞ then it is called a source, repeller, or unstable equilibrium,  
> - If an equilibrium attracts neighboring solutions as t → ∞ then it is called a sink, attractor, or stable equilibrium,  
> - If an equilibrium is neither a source nor a sink, then it is called a node, or semi-stable.

> [!note] Equilibrium solution
> Occurs at the points where $\text{RHS}=f(y)=0$

> [!question] $\frac{dy}{dx}=(y-1)(y-2)^2(y-3)$
> Equilibrium solutions: $y=1,y=2,y=3$
