# Vectors as arrows
Vectors can be represented as arrows from P to Q: $\mathbf{v}=\vec{PQ}$ or $\vec{v}=\vec{PQ}$
In this example, P is the tail and Q is the head of the arrow.
The arrow has length and direction.
The length of a vector is denoted $||\vec{v}||$.

# Relations between vectors
> [!definition] Parallel vectors
> vectors with the same angle  
> can have opposite directions  
> assume that they are not the zero vector  

> [!definition] Translations
> ame direction and same length  
> *"$\vec{v}$ is a translation of $\vec{w}$"*  
> In this class, #Class/MATH_20C , we consider $\vec{v}$ and $\vec{w}$ to be the same.  

# Vector operations
> [!definition] Addition
> $\vec{v}+\vec{w}$ is defined as the diagonal of the parallelogram composed of $\vec{v}$, $\vec{w}$, and the parallels of the two vectors  
> $\vec{v}+\vec{w}$ can also be defined as the vector formed from the long leg of the triangle with $\vec{v}$ and $\vec{w}$, where the head of $\vec{v}$ is attached to the tail of $\vec{w}$.  
> $\vec{v}_{1}+\vec{v}_{2}+\vec{v}_{3}=(\vec{v}_{1}+\vec{v}_{2})+\vec{v}_{3}=\vec{v}_{1}+(\vec{v}_{2}+\vec{v}_{3})$  

> [!definition] Scalar multiplication
> $\lambda$ real number/scalar  
> $\vec{v}$ vector  
> scalar multiplication $\lambda \vec{v}$ is defined by stretching the length of the vector by $\lambda$.  
> $0\vec{v}=\vec{0}$  
> $(-1)\vec{v}=-\vec{v}$, which is the unique vector with the same length with opposite direction.  
> $-\vec{v}+\vec{v}=\vec{0}$  
> In general, $\vec{v}$ and $\vec{w}$ are parallel iff $\vec{v}=\lambda \vec{w},\lambda\neq 0$  

# Properties of scalar multiplication
> [!definition] $||\lambda \vec{v}||=|\lambda||\vec{v}||$

> [!definition] $\lambda \vec{v}$ points in the direction as $\vec{v}$ if $\lambda>0$, the oposite direction to $\vec{v}$ if $\lambda<0$

> [!definition] $0\vec{v}=\vec{0}$

> [!definition] $(-1)\vec{v}=-\vec{v}$

> [!example] Vector subtraction
> $\vec{v}-\vec{w}=\vec{v}+(-\vec{w})$  

# Algebraic Description
$P=(a_{1},b_{1})$
$Q=(a_{2},b_{2})$
$\vec{v}=\vec{PQ}=<a_{2}-a_{1},b_{2}-b_{1}>$
