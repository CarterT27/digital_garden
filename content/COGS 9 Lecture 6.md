#  Data and Getting Data  
  
## Structured Data  
  
> [!note] How do we get data from a RDB (relational database)?  
> A query (SQL code) to a Table in a DB  
  
> [!definition] RDB (Relational Database)  
> A piece of software that enables you to relate tables of data together and perform actions on that data.  
  
## Joins  
  
> [!note] Inner Join  
> Include any row in both tables  
  
> [!note] Left Join  
> Include all rows in first table  
  
> [!note] Right Join  
> Include all rows in second table  
  
> [!note] Full Join (Outer)  
> Include any row in either table  
  
> [!definition] RDB  
> A **relational database (RDB)** is a way of structuring information in tables, rows, and columns. An RDB has the ability to establish links - or relationships - between information by joining tables, which makes it easy to understand and gain insights about the relationship between various data points.  
  
## Unstructured Data  
  
> [!note] Unstructured Data Types  
> - Text files and documents  
> - Websites and applications  
> - Sensor data  
> - Image files  
> - Audio files  
> - Video files  
> - Email data  
> - Social media data  
  
> [!note] Questions to ask when dealing with data  
> 1. How do I access the data?  
> 2. What is the format of this data?  
> 3. Technical/ethical concerns accessing data?  
> 4. How should I store this data?  
  
## Review  
  
> [!note] Data Types  
> - Qualitative vs. Quantitative  
> - What is data?  
> - What is a data standard, e.g. ISO-8601  
  
> [!note] Data Formats  
> - Structured vs. semi-structured vs. unstructured  
> - What is CSV, XML, JSON, how are they different, how are they alike  
> - What is the relationship betrween RDB and SQL  
> - How do we access data from a RDB  
> - How do joins in SQL allow us to get rich and complex data from a RDBMS  
  
> [!note] Understand the Process  
> - What questions do we need to ask when reviewing the data used in a data sci project?  
> - Be able to talk about how tht example projects we went over in class were able to use raw data  
> E.g. a raw google street image picture was used to create new data, which was then analyzed.
