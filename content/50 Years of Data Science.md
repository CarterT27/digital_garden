> [!note] Data Science Versus Statistics
> Statisticians see the data science movement as something that overshadows what statistics has been doing for a long time.  
> Some people see data science as not needing statistics at all, even making statistics irrelevant.  

> [!note] The "Big Data" Meme
> - History: Big data has been around for over 200 years (US Census)
> - Science: statisticians discovered sampling and sufficiency because they care about large datasets

> [!note] The "Skills" Meme
> Big data skills are not for solving the real problems, rather, they are coping skills for dealing with large-scale clustering of data.  
> The range of easily constructible algorithms has shrunk compared to the single-processor model.  

> [!note] The "Jobs" Meme
> Data scientists need years of hands-on experience post-masters degree before adding significant value to their employers.  
> The databases, software, and workflow are already set in stone.  

> [!note] The Future of Data Science, 1962
> Data science is a complex scientific field.  
> Data science is larger than statistics.  

> [!note] Code and Data Analysis
> The quantitative programming language S was developed in the mid-1970s.  
> R, created in the 1990s, is the current dominant programming language in academic statistics.  
> Scripts codify computations into workflows at a much higher, abstracted level than traditional programming languages. These workflows can then be shared with others much more easily.  

> [!note] Breiman's Two Cultures, 2001
> Statistics either has the goal to predict or infer from the data (the two cultures).  
> Inference is (was) about 98% of academic statisticians, assuming that there is a true model that is generating the data.  
> Predictions are in line with the machine learning culture.  

# The Predictive Culture's Secret Sauce

> [!note] The Common Task Framework (CTF)
> 1. A public available training set with observations with a list of features and a class label
> 2. A set of competitors who are trying to infer a class prediction rule from the data
> 3. A referee that runs the prediction rule against a testing dataset and automatically reports the prediction score of the rule

> [!note] Experience with CTF
> 1. Error rates decline each year, asymptoting based on task and data quality
> 2. Progress comes from many small improvements
> 3. Shared data plays a crucial role

> [!definition] Data Scientist
> Person who is better at statistics than any software engineer and better at software engineering than any statistician.
