**Empirical distribution of a statistic**  
The empirical distribution of a [[Statistic]] is based on simulated values of the statistic. It describes:  
- All observed values of the statistic.  
- The [[proportion]] of [[Sample|samples]] in which each value occurred.  
The empirical distribution of a statistic can be a good approximation to the [[Probability Distribution]] of the statistic, **if the number of repetitions in the simulation is large**.
