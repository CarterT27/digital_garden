# Reproducibility and Bias  
  
- Define what constitutes reproducible & replicable data science  
- Explain the challenges and limitations to reproducibility & replicability  
- Understand confirmation bias & Identify cases of confirmation bias  
  
> [!definition] Reproducibility  
> re-performing the same analysis (with the same code) using a different analyst  
  
> [!note] Reasons for a study to fail to be **reproducible**  
> - data not provided, unable to be shared  
> - lack of peer review, or not in a transparent process  
> - missing code, failure to publish code, trade secrets  
> - different data provided  
> - lack of computational literacy  
> - different software versions, deprecated software, or legacy systems  
> - lack of statistical literacy or maliciousness (p-hacking)  
> - poorly written or incomplete documentation  
> - no cash or funding  
  
> [!note] The Replicability Crisis  
  
> [!definition] Replicable  
> re-performing the experiment and collecting new data  
  
> [!note] Replicability is harder than reproducibility  
> because, by definnition, the underlying data are different. And data are variable.  
  
> [!definition] Replicability  
> “The measurement can be obtained with stated precision by a different team using the same measurement procedure, the same measuring system, under the same operating conditions, in the same or a different location on multiple trials.”  
  
> [!note] Reasons for a study failing to replicate  
> - Finding was not "real" (or small effect size)  
> - Measurement error  
> - Variable finding (things change over time)  
> - Samples come from different populations  
> - Different experimental design or conditions  
> - Fraud  
  
> [!definiton] The Unicorn Test  
> If you find a "unicorn" result, return to your data several times and from a different view points until you are fully convinced.  
  
> [!definition] Cognitive Bias  
> A cognitive bias wherein humans have a tendency to search for, interpret, favor, and recall information in a way that confirms one's preexisting beliefs or hypotheses.
