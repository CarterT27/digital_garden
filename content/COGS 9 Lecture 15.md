> Dominance on some attributes but not all.  
> E.g. Object A is cheaper, has better reviews than Object B.  

> [!note] Research Questions  
> - Is the dominance effect real?  
>   - (beyond the lab and 2-3 item choice sets; preference uncertainty)  
> - Are dominance relationships prevalent?  
>   - (why would there be dominated items?)  
> - How does the effect work?  
>   - Perceptual vs. Cognitive  

> [!note] Fiverr Case Study  
> Dominating gigs have a 40% increase in clients than non-dominating gigs (1% vs. 0.7%), and dominated gigs have no clients.  

> [!note] Experiencability of Categories - Preference Uncertainty  
> Experienceable category vs. non-experienceable category  

> [!note] Magnitude of Dominance  
> Cognitive vs. Perceptual  
> Dominance increases with the size of the dominance -> perceptual, not just similarity  
> Dominance increases the closer two objects are -> perceptual  

> [!note] Price Contrast in the Wild  
> How does an outlier price effect demand?  
> When there is an extreme price, the distribution shifts to the left, meaning people are less likely to buy from the marketplace as a whole.  

> [!note] Communication Style  
> Communication style is more indirect or direct depending on the culture that you come from.  

> [!note] Dark side of Discrimination Awareness  
> For pro sellers, women sellers get asked for revisions much more.
