``` ad-Theorem
title: Negation

1. The opposite of
> [For all $x,P(x)$ is true]
> is [There exists $x$ for which $P(x)$ is not true].

Above, $P$ stands for "property." Symbollically, the sentence is written
> The opposite of $(\forall x)P(x)$ is $(\exists x)\text{ not }P(x)$.

Another standard notation for $(\exists x)\text{ not }P(x)$ is $(\exists x)|\text{ not } P(x)$, where the bar | means "such that."

2. The opposite of
> [There exists $x$ for which P(x) is truue]
> is [For all $x,P(x)$ is not true].

Symbolically the same sentence is written
> The opposite of $(\exists x)P(x)$ is $(\forall x)\text{ not }P(x)$.

```
**Remark.** A mathematical statement is true if and only if its opposite is true. 
Another way to say this is that the opposite of a statement being true implies the statement to be true.

*Example:* The statement "All eleven-legged alligators are orange with blue spots" is true, since if it were false, then there would exist an eleven-legged alligator that is not orange with blue spots.
The statement "All eleven-legged alligators are black with white stripes" is equally true.
