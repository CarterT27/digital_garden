**Remark.** A mathematical statement is true if and only if its opposite is true.  
Another way to say this is that the opposite of a statement being true implies the statement to be true.

*Example:* The statement "All eleven-legged alligators are orange with blue spots" is true, since if it were false, then there would exist an eleven-legged alligator that is not orange with blue spots.  
The statement "All eleven-legged alligators are black with white stripes" is equally true.
