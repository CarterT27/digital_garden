# Synesthesia and Cross-Modality

> [!note] Touch Sense
> - Can work directly as sculptural texture
> - When certain textures are used to evoke touching such surfaces
> - When the object breaks our expectations
> - Melting clocks, soft disco balls, obese cars
> - Body mutilation, body amorphism (activist mirroring)
> - Also with movement, think JACKASS

## Synesthesia

> [!note] Synaesthesia
> Synaesthesia is a neurological condition in which stimulation of one sensory
> or cognitive pathway leads to involuntary experiences in a second sensory or
> cognitive pathway. People with syneshesia, known as syneshetes, might see
> colors when they hear music, taste flavors when they see certain shapes, or
> associate specific colors with numbers or letters. Synesthesia can involve any
> combination of the senses, and the experiences are consistent and repeatable
> for the pesron who has it. This condition highlights the complex
> interconnecttivity of sensory perceptions in the human brain, offering
> insights into how we perceive and interpret the world around us.

Inducer -> Concurrent

1. Synaesthesia runs in families.
2. Synaesthetes often report 'odd' or weird colors they cannot see in the real
   world but see only in association with numbers. 
3. If a person has one type, of synaesthesia, she is more likely to have a
   second or third type.
4. There appears to be tremendous heterogeneity in synaesthesia.
8. Ordinary language use is rich with synaesthetic metaphors.
9. Synaesthesia appears to be more common among artists, poets, novelists, and
   creative people in general.
