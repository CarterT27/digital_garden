> [!note] `*args`
> - Used when an unknown number of arguments will be passed into a function
> - Denoted by * in the method header
> - processed in a similar manner to a list

> [!note] `default_arguments`
> - Basically normal arguments, but with a default value
> - If no value is passed, default value is set
> - If a value is passed, default value is overridden

> [!note] `norm, *args, **kwargs`
> `*args` and `darg` can be swapped in order, however the behavior slightly changes (??)

> [!note] Recursion
> Recursion is a design method for code - it refers to a class of functions that call on itself repeatedly. 

> [!note] Recursion - Base Case
> Determine the stop point and begin the argument passing up the "stack" of recursive calls.

> [!note] Recursion - Recursive Calls
> Every call needs to trend towards the base case.
