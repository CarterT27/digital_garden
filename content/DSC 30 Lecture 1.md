## Class Overview

- Introduction to the basic data structures used in computer science:
    - Understand each data structure in detail
    - Analyze the algorithms that use them
    - Know limitations of each data structure
- Practice designing and applying data structures to real world problems through coding.
- Learn some Java as a programming language.

## Why Java for Data Science?

- Java is fast
    - Great for developing back end of machine learning algos
- Has good selection of libraries:
    - For ML
- Understand someone else’s code
- Understand terminology
- Resume looks better
- For this class in particular

## In Particular...

Efficiency
- Good algorithms.
- Good data structures.

Programming(efficiently)
- Designing, building, testing, and debugging large programs.
- Use of programming tools.
    - git, IntelliJ and JUnit
- Java (not the main focus of this class)

## Why Study Algorithms and Data Structures?

- To find a job
- To keep a job

## Basic Rules of Java

All code in Java must be part of a class
For code to run you need to have 
public static void main(String[] args)
We mark the beginning and end of segments of code using  {  and  }
All statements in Java must end in a semi-colon: ;

Before Java variables can be used, they must be declared
Java variable must have a specific type: 
int, String, double, boolean etc
Types can never change
Types are verified before the code even runs
Big difference between Python and Java

## Defining Functions - Basic Rules

Functions must be declared as part of a class in Java
A function that is inside a class is called a “method”
All functions in Java are methods
To define a function in Java we use “public static”
Other ways are later
All parameters must have a declared type
Return value of the function must have a declared type
Functions in Java return only one value
