> [!definition] Probability That Two Events Both Happen
> Suppose that $A$ and $B$ are two [[Event|events]], and that all [[Outcome|outcomes]] are equally likely. Then, the [[Probability|probability]] that both $A$ and $B$ occur is $$P(A\text{ and }B)=\frac{\text{\# of outcomes satisfying both A and B}}{\text{total \# of outcomes}}$$

> [!question]- What is the probability that the roll of a fair six-sided die is 3 or less **and** even?
> $$\frac{1}{6},\text{ \{2\} satisfies both conditions, there are 6 total outcomes}$$
