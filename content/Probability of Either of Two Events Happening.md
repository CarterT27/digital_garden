> [!definition] Probability of Either of Two Events Happening
> Suppose that $A$ and $B$ are two [[Event|events]], and that all [[Outcome|outcomes]] are [[Equally-Likely Outcomes|equally-likely]]. Then, the [[Probability|probability]] that either $A$ or $B$ occur is $$P(A\text{ or }B)=\frac{\text{\# of outcomes satisfying either A or B}}{\text{ total \# of outcomes}}$$

> [!question]- What is the probability that the roll of a fair six-sided die is even or at least 5?
> $\frac{\{2,4,6\}+\{5,6\}}{6}=\frac{4}{6}=\frac{2}{3}$
> We don't count double count outcomes, so the number of total outcomes is $\{2,4,5,6\}$, or $4$.
