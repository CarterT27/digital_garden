 More my way now to see Chris Newhart down in Philly he's going to do my new headshots. Thank you. A little camera. Can we get a little S7? Yeah. Is that the way I have it? Yeah. What's that, brother? Come on in. Alright, what we're doing headshots today for Matt. And we got this awesome studio here with got a lot of lights. But the problem is we got a lot of eye lights. So we got a lower, if you come over here you'll see. We got a lower, how much light is actually getting in it? Even though usually one night. So we got a fake wall here for big negative fill. We got a moveable negative fill. We got a four by four just keep a nice even consistency. Good two to one ratios on my going with a dark dark gray today. Make that skin pop. Make a pop on and then later we have the hookers coming. Is that closing hit on me? Alright, so I just got back from Philly. And Chris sent me the raw photos to start looking at what plenty to work through. But there's some that you look through here and it's just super awkward. But there's a couple good ones in there. That's pretty good. This one right here is it has to be my favorite. Favorite bad outtake. Yeah, this looks like some cheesy colonel. I think that's the nature of headshots in general. You're going to take, you know, 200, 300 photos in a day. And you're going to wittle it down to the ones that you like. And really at the end of the day if you have four or five really good photos that you like. That's good enough. The one thing that Chris touched on was this use of negative fill. I think this is a really fascinating concept when it comes to lighting. At least when I first started out, I'm thinking about what lights am I going to add to this scene. And Chris introduced me to this idea of negative fill, which is the process of actually eliminating light and blocking off light from hitting your subject. There's so many big windows and natural light is often great. But he's trying to shape the light around my face to create a shadow. And that's something that you can see in our interviews and with design instructors pretty much everyone. We had a negative fill, which was a black rag tied up to a sea stand to shape that shadow on the side of the face. Which, you know, a lot of times when you're starting out, you just want the person lit. You just throw one light and you just fill up the entire scene with light. And that's not necessarily what you want to do. That doesn't really create a mood or create a tone. It's not the most flattering way to light a subject. So that's it for this video. Go higher, Chris new heart to your portraits. He's incredible. If he can make me look halfway decent, you know he's good. See ya.
