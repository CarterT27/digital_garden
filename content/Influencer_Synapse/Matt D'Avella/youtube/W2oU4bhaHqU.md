About this video...
Hi my name is Matt D'Avella and I directed Minimalism: A Documentary About the Important Things. The most commonly asked question I get from fans of the film is "Are you a minimalist as well?" 

Yes, I am. But my girlfriend isn't. It makes trips to Ikea interesting (we joke that after the cashiers they should offer couples counseling) but we make it work. I don't think we have the best design taste in the world but we keep things simple.

## Transcript
 Hi there, my name is Matt Diavella, I directed the Netflix documentary Minimalism and this is my minimalist apartment. I live here with my not a minimalist girlfriend Natalie. Our trips to IKEA can be a little challenging but we make it work. Let's take a look inside the kitchen. These are all the plates cups and bowls that we own. When we have more guests over, we bring out the paper plates. But lucky for us, we don't have any friends. Here's our dining room. It's where we eat. It's where I host my podcast and presently where I'm pretending to write emails. This is my frame photo of the rock. Here's my humble at home editing suite. It's where I do most of my video editing these days. I really like this desk. It hides my hard drive cables and search protector behind this gate. It's even got a peg for my headphones to keep my desk clutter free. Before this, my workspace was a nightmare with cords, cables, hard drives, adapters, all dangling under my desk. The living room. We don't have a lot of furniture so we really do put a lot of time and energy into each piece that we buy. We do have a TV and hey, look what's on. It's the award-winning Netflix documentary minimalism. That's so weird. Guests have caught our bathroom aggressively pink. We won't spend any extra time in here. And finally, the bedroom. I spent about 25 minutes making the blanket look like it was casually thrown on the bed. I'd say I fit about 90 to 95% of my clothing and the three drawers to the right. Natalie uses the other three. And an entire walk-in closet. These are all of my clothes. And this is also when you call the police because you realize that only a serial killer would organize their clothes so neatly. And that concludes my minimalist apartment tour. Otherwise known as the worst episode of MTV Cribs Ever. If you like this video, I make a lot of them. Subscribe to this channel for more. Or go to minimalistfilmaker.com. If you like podcasts, I've got one of those. It's called the Ground Up Show. I interviewed people like Dan Harris, Rich Roll, and the minimalist to hear their stories and how they made things happen. Go to groundupshow.com for the podcast. That's it. Thanks for watching.
