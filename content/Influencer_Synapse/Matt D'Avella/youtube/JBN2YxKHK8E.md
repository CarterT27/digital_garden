 What's easier said than done? People say just go do it. You know, it's a Nike slogan. Just do it. It's easy to say, but it's hard to do it. What advice would you give to somebody who needs to just do it? Create a consequence. What I like to recommend is send money in an envelope to a friend, but address it to an organization you hate vehemently with a deadline and set a smart goal. Something that's actionable that you can measure it, but it has a timetable. And it has to be within your reach. You can't say like, oh, I'm going to get this job. It would be like, I'm going to apply to this many jobs. Something that is completely within your control. And that will usually create a consequence to your inaction that is greater than your perceived consequences to action.
