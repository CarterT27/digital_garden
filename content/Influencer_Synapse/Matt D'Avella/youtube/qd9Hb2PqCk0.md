How could you possibly hold an epic jingle competition without a trophy? As the Get The Rock on Matt's Podcast jingle competition came to a close a few weeks ago I decided to set off across the world to hand deliver the trophy to the winner.

That's not totally true. Nat & I had already booked plans for London and the timing worked out too perfectly not to meet up with Sam and give him a little gift for his hard work.

While this video was all in good fun there is a deeper message here about overcoming your self-doubt and releasing your work into the world. Enjoy!!

## Transcript
 This month I ended a jingle competition and it's only right that I give the winner a trophy. The only problem is the winner lives in London. The winner lives in London. Thank you. Damn, we've got money. Nice to meet you too. Sam Tier. Hello. Winner of the Get the Rock on Matt's podcast jingle competition. I wanted to give you something in person. It is the trophy. Oh my God. Or the Get the Rock on Matt's podcast. That is a nice competition. That's awesome. Yeah, you're very welcome. There it is. I figured if you're going to do a competition, you got to actually have a trophy. So I'm never going to want a trophy. I've never won a trophy. It's just like that. I think I felt like a participation one. So I came all the way to London halfway around the world from California to deliver. Sam Tier is trophy. Okay, that's not true. We actually had planned this trip about a month or two ago. But I saw on that Monday when I closed the competition that Sam was going to win and then he was from London. So I reached out to him. We coordinated time to meet up. And I printed an overnighted a trophy to my apartment in California. So it was great to see his reaction when I handed it to him because he wasn't expecting it. I could have just posted it to me though. Thank you. Appreciate it. Alright, so I want to film a line of acoustic version of the jingle. Where do you want to go? I think there's a bump. Oh, really? Maybe this way. I was happy thinking it would be funny to like get like a chair. Have you like sit up on a street corner? Gather around the crowd. And then you do like literally a five second jingle. And then you pack everything up. Look, great. Here we go. Now, I think the most important thing about this entire experience is that after talking with Sam for a bit, he told me that he almost never sent in his jingle. So what I was recording it, I thought it was like fun. I had a great time. And then as soon as it came time to send it in, the self-doubt starts and you think, oh, I don't think it's that good or that funny. It's that thing of you just have, I have self doubt like anyone. And I forced myself to send it in and how it goes. You just see what happened. So what's the worst case scenario? That was, that was my exact thought of, you know, where the worst thing is going to happen. I didn't, I didn't think I'd hear back. That was what I thought. That was in my head. Once I submitted it, I just completely forgot about it. I was like, right, that's it. It's done until I started hearing it on the podcast and they're talking about it. And then I just come out from it. Yeah. If people want to find your music, yep, find more about what you do, where do we send it? So I've just launched a new website, SamTid.com. On there has all of my music. And it has a new blog. I actually started writing a piece all about this experience and about self doubt which I'm going to put up in the next couple of days. So on my website, you can hear everything, but also on Spotify and Apple Music, all those sort of streaming services. You can hear my new acoustic EP on that. Cool man. What thanks for submitting. Thank you. Thanks for your part of it. And thanks for the trophy. So we're here in London and we're going to be in Iceland taking a little bit of a break in a vacation. But it was great to meet up with Sam and also to be reminded of the reason why I make podcasts and talk about a lot of stuff that I do is because a lot of us are going through doubts every day. It's hard to push out our creations into the world, whether it's a song or a video or a podcast. There's a lot that holds us back from creating these things. And sometimes we just need to think about what's the worst case scenario. All right, if I put this thing out there, what's going to happen. Maybe right now I'm having some doubts I feel like it's not going to be reset that well received. But at the end of the day, what is it matter? I put this thing out there as somebody doesn't respond. Doesn't like it. So what? Get on to the next thing and keep creating. Thanks for watching. And if you guys want to watch my vlog from both London and Iceland, it's going to be on my secret vlog, which is for Patreon subscribers. So go to patreon.com slash Matt Diivella to check it out.
