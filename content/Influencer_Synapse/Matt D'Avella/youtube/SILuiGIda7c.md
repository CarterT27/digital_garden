## Transcript
 Hey everybody welcome back to the ground up show the podcast as you know that is hosted from my dining room and finally after 60 episodes of recording this podcast in Los Angeles I have found the worst time to record so for about 15 minutes in this podcast not a very long time you will hear the light and beautiful sounds of my neighbor's lawn being landscape there is 60 seconds of exceptionally annoying lawn blowing I don't know what it was it sounded like something at a transformers it wasn't pleasant but I didn't want to edit it out because my guest had some I thought really interesting comments during those moments so I did my best to tune it down I don't think it's going to be very distracting but of course I just wanted to warn you that's the nature of building something from the ground up you don't always have the ideal setup you don't always have the best locations to shoot at sometimes you have to do it in your dining room when you're just getting started out that's the way it is that's the beauty of the show and that's the beauty of starting something from nothing so anyway just wanted to give you a brief warning but my guest today is a very creative very talented director named Cole Wallister he has worked with some pretty big talent including Milisaurus Kitty Perry and Hank on the podcast we talk about traditional media versus new media building confidence and why decision making is the most important skill that you need to learn if you want to be successful in any field it's a very interesting podcast I think you'll get tons and tons of value from it but first before we get into that I would love to talk a little bit about how I make a living and how I'm able to do this podcast advertisement free it's because of viewers and listeners

much for being here today thanks for having me excited to chat both about like the new media the traditional media and like where that overlap we already talked a little bit about it but before we get into that why don't you tell me a little bit about the work that you currently do well I am currently a director who does a lot of beauty stuff so I started with like female pop star type content and and that is segue into stuff for like cover girl Revlon Almei I did a spot for Garney last week I do stuff for painting and a lot of beauty focused things I do other things but that sort of seems to be my my initial little bit what happened mine yeah how did that the niche niche a how did that start like when did you first like find that lane because it definitely the work that you do now is the work you're going to get in the future so at some point there had to be like the the beginnings well it first started with pink really I started working with her in 2009 and that was like my first major artist I was doing some stuff with I did stuff with miley Cyrus like when she was doing the Hannah Montana thing and a bit of stuff with Britney early so even I guess then it was sort of leaning a little bit more female pop star beauty stuff but working with pink I ended up working with her for like eight years and so I was doing her content behind the scenes I was doing her tour videos like the content that plays during the her shows I would direct that stuff so the opening closing of her tour videos did documentaries on the road with her but um she ended up being a cover girl and so when she started doing that she brought me on to do the content I met the cover girl people and then I ended up working with Katie Katie was also a cover girl then I was doing both Katie and pink's cover girl stuff and once you have that sort of on your resume other beauty brands are like oh we can use this guy for this or that and it's sort of like grew from there that's an interesting kind of position where I don't think a lot of people realize this but the fact that talent has a lot of say in terms of oh yeah it gets hired and it doesn't I was talking to Brian Bowen's Smith about that where he'll have you know certain people that will like actors or whoever fight for him to get the job because they really love working with him or they love his work or whatever it may be is that something that you found happen quite well yeah I mean talent at that caliber yeah talent has all the leverage you know to me so it's like if they want something then the brand the client is going to do it you know what I mean of course I think I'm sure there's there's discussion sometimes and you know there's you have to make the best choice for things but if I've been kicked off job is because the talent I didn't have a strong relationship with them and they had their guy you know and then so I didn't get that job you know I mean so it goes both ways I guess but I've been sort of fortunate enough to have good sort of relationships with different with different talent and that has been helpful yeah but I don't want to make it seem like oh just go out and just like try to be if all of these celebrities you know I mean yeah it's never going to happen no that's never going to work but like you know I I never sort of like became friends with them through work you know it's like the work was doing you know I would have think that I'm doing good work for for that person and like that relationship bloom from that as a basis you know to me and so that has been beneficial in the career yeah there are there are only there's only so far that like just connections in friendship I think can take you because I certainly know of people who've gotten gigs or opportunity and especially access over myself regardless of their talent but inevitably the talent's going to speak for itself and you can only get so far if you're not actually good at what you do oh yeah I mean I like talent is like the baseline in LA unfortunately you know to mean like everybody out here is super skilled and super talented and that's where it starts then becomes like what else can you add to the table what other value can you add and that's where people find that's where you really sort of find your success and and can thrive you know what I mean so it's sort of like it can be discouraging to be like talent is like is the bare minimum you need like you need talent obviously but I mean it it only goes up from there so well it's tough right because there's just a lot of people it's just kind of saturated at this point oh yeah uh where especially coming to a place like LA or New York where even if you have the the skills and the chops to be able to to get your foot in the door is kind of tough right oh absolutely and and for me it was like I I generally am thankful that I sort of started my career just before like the DSLR revolution in the YouTube world whereas I started getting some work and sort of establishing myself before that happened because I just think it's it became so saturated like you said and it was so hard to stand out afterwards I would notice people would be making really dope stuff and like getting zero recognition and zero notice and I was just I was like oh man that's tough it's tough out there yeah you know what I mean so do you have this experience where I will look at some people's work who have been maybe in the game for a year and I'm like holy shit like it's really good like my first three years combined I couldn't find enough like talent in those years like I was shooting with uh you know many DVDs and yeah my first professional camera was a Canon XHA1 which was like a great camera at the time but now it's like you couldn't use that or really John anything and so it's it's kind of it's kind of an interesting place because it and I don't know I think there's probably only so far that that can get you right because the in terms of like quality like you buy a red camera great but can you actually use it can you like work with clients can you deliver on deadlines and do all these other things that are necessary to make it well that's a thing too you know yes there's a ton of like these really young kids that have a great eye that are talented and and I was listening to actually another show of yours in the day and you were talking about how it's super valuable to consume a lot of media early on and I think that that's never been more accessible and prevalent with the sort of new generation today because because of Instagram because of YouTube it's like you can quickly refine your style and tone by like browsing the popular pictures you know what I mean but I think that there as we mentioned before it's like people trying to make the jump of like making cool content to being a sort of working director with brands and clients is a bit of a disconnect because you have to manage more than just like making a cool thing and that was a big lesson for me was as I sort of grows a director and started doing sort of more like bigger jobs with bigger clients I started to realize that it wasn't so much about like oh having a cool idea in executing this it's about managing production, client relations like like delivering something that that the client wants you to deliver and that has been a sort of a learning lesson for me it's more the business managerial side that I think is rely as my success is sort of due in part of it's not just like oh I know how to have like a cool idea and make it awesome every single shoot it's like all the other stuff you know I mean what you never get access to or experience it and making just like a cool too many video for you to wherever you know right because if you make an amazing film for a client something that like they would be thrilled to have and like super like it would be on their expectations beyond their wildest dreams but you deliver it a week late or you deliver it past the deadline or you don't communicate properly that relationship is going to crumble doesn't matter how good you are there's probably only few people and like we were talking about like where the talent can have this way sometimes you can get in that position but if you're starting out like that there's no way that you're going to be able to continue getting gigs yeah I mean I think I wish I could remember this specific there I read something about this exact thing where there was like three sort of facets where it was like good to work with yes it was like on time my ends ever kind of switching on and off whereas like basically a cost yeah time and then I forget good to work with I'm going to work so there's these three facets and you can if you do two of them well you can like mess up on one so like if you're really good to work with and I think it was like it was being being good to work with like they like you making a good product and then being on time so it's like if you're if you're if you're good to work with and you make a good product but you're often late they'll still hire you because they like you and you do good work so they'll deal with you being late sometimes if you're late and they really like you and your like your product is sorry if you're on time and they really like you and your product is so so they'll still hire you because like turn it on time and they work with you so you'll still get jobs and so it's like I was found into interesting that that you need two of those three variables to continue working and it seemed applicable I mean I try to hit all three of course right but it just sort of it was an interesting thought on like how you can continue to work and what clients might be thinking of when they're hiring you and working with you you know what I mean so it's not necessarily but like obviously the goal is to be as good as you can and all facets but like if you're good they could hate you but like if your work is good and it's on time and they hate you they'll still they'll put up with your bullshit so like these good and these on time you know what I mean yeah it's an interesting way to see it it's a balancing act and I think that also comes into play with how much you can charge and you're right and like increasing your rate is like if you if you can nail all three of them then you're the kind of person that can charge your premium because people are willing to pay to be able to check all three boxes yeah I mean you know in in the instance where you are all three where your work is good your on time you know and they like you it's like then it's like you'll work with them forever they're like who you're you know they're they'll be a client for as long as you want to do it right yeah so you're doing a lot of work in the industry you're directing some pretty awesome talent and then you start to dabble with YouTube and kind of making these the vlogs and YouTube like your YouTube channel is pretty cool because it's got a blend of both your personal life and then offering some of these like directing tips and advice for filmmakers that are just getting started out why did you decided to go that route well you know I thought about it I sort of was thinking about this a lot last year where I was like you know do Instagram was like fun and I'd put some work on there but I wasn't super serious about it the beginning of last year and I did this one job for e called the glam bot which is like high speed red carpet glam stuff and I co-directed one with this guy Nigel Barker was like a famous photographer and so at the end of the the job you know I'll usually if I do a job and if it takes me like a month to work on this job all like when it's done I'm like one post and like that's it and I would it would even occur to me like some people like aren't even seen that but I don't want to be annoying and post all the time you know at that period I was trying to figure out exactly what my approach was and then so after that job Nigel posted like five videos like a ton of content about this one job and and to me I saw it and I was like there's no way that you don't know that he did this job you know to me and then I looked at my stuff and I was like you could easily miss that I even worked on this thing because I had one little post you know to mean so I and I realized I was like okay I need to have a much stronger presence on social because this is not going away you know to mean it just became more of a priority for me and being able to put it in my schedule is like okay now is the time for me to really do it okay yeah you want to take the hands up sure what comes to mind for me is like making noise and making a little bit of noise and I think it's an Malcolm Gladwell book or something also making noise there's a lot of noise happening in the background right now so I'm sorry which is great this is so funny because I've done this podcast for over a year and probably about 13 months now at this apartment and there's always every once in a while like really loud noises but always happens just before after the podcast but today we hit the unfortunately lottery it's like we'll work through it yeah it's like so pretty good at cutting that out but anyway so I forget where it came from but it was about making noise and there was this dishwasher that they made that was so efficient and so quiet that you wouldn't even hear it working and then people kept returning it because I thought it was broken because they didn't know it wasn't making any noise there was so basically added a light hum a light sound to it to let people know that work was happening and sometimes people have to do this in the corporate environment where they have to let their bosses know what they're doing and if they don't then they assume that they're not doing shit and in fact they could be busing their ass but in the in the same way of like being in the industry and working on some pretty amazing projects you need to be able to take ownership and credit for it and be like hey that's something that I did you know and then there's also like opportunity I think like twofold and like people see that you could potentially get work from it you could also build an audience that could be an avenue for you know monetizing and creating content totally different way yeah yeah yeah I mean there's there's you know there's no downsides to making more content as as a filmmaker and as a creator other than it just takes up your time you know mean but like if that becomes a part of what you want to be doing and a part of your overall like plan for your career then it's then it's worth it and it's interesting you're talking about sort of like letting people know that you're working I see that all the time with like clients and creative directors where they want input just so they can either say that they did something or like feel like they're contributing to the shoots and so they're always like chiming in with like random thoughts and half of my job then is like trying to make them feel like incorporated but still like retaining my ideas like what I wanted to do you know so yeah so I get co-director credit on that yeah I mean I mean some people have gone that far but like but most of the time it's like them just chiming out ideas to just be a part not necessarily because they're like oh this is an idea that I feel like absolutely make things better but just like oh like how about this or how about that so they they can influence it and I think then go to their bosses and be like oh yeah that was my thing or that was my thing you know so I think everybody is always trying to sort of like assert their value and sort of like leave their mark on it and the other thing I want to say about that too is like it is super valuable of course to let people know what you're working on and I think for me it was a bit of a challenge to sort of figure out like when that's an appropriate thing and then when that comes off it's like braggie or like just becoming too boastful you know and so I think that it's so important the only thing I can really distinguish it is like with the tone you know to mean like tone plays a really big part in whether it's like your showcasing a bit of your work that you're proud of and then you're like coming off as being like braggie you know because I never want to be that braggie type of person but like on social it's like kind of a bragging you know to mean so it's been a bit of a thing to navigate a little bit. Yeah well I could say just from watching the vlogs that you've done some behind the scenes shoots where like you're directing Bruce Willis or you're doing any of these really cool things with with huge talent like your personality comes across as like somebody who's just like super stoked to be there and you be able to experience it but then also like what I found to be really a great takeaway was seeing how confident you were in those situations a lot of it was just like watching you work right where it's just like this is the way that you direct talent in like 10 seconds like sure yeah they're there and you got they got to come in and out and you got to make sure that like you have like some plightness and formalities and not go too quick but then I think your personality like the longer that you do it and the longer that you make it as long as like you are a good person and like you you want the best and like you're just trying to like either show people aside that they may not have seen or to teach people or to just you know let people be able to watch a video and have a good time yeah I think in the longer and that stuff's going to come out and like it's it would be so draining to fake that right if you go you had to put on a personality every time you hold it around yeah yeah that would be that would be tricky and I think that's sort of like that's the long-term recourse of the social world that we're living in like everybody is presenting something and even me you know to me like it's almost sort of like false to think that I'm not filtering things online it all it all is but it's like does that mean that it's not the stuff that I show is not truly me you know to me I mean we can get into this whole like ethereal discussion about social identity and your true identity and stuff but I think that you know it's it is important just exactly as you said you know to just to be yourself and to use your personality to whatever advantages it can give you one set and I think for me I've sort of been fortunate enough to find a way to you I mean I'm Canadian my politeness plays a big part into into my directing style but in those moments you know just to just to work on I guess try to you know figure out how to use your personality as a strength on set is really valuable and of course fake in that would be not only exhausting but probably not effective yeah and I think that there's what's cool is that you can see so many different templates and so many different directors or whatever craft it is that we're talking about that have totally different personality types you know there's so many youtubers I know that are actually quiet reserved and you know introverted yeah but they're able to use that to their strengths and how they tell a story and I think that's one of those things that people when you just see those that are like maybe the outgoing eccentric director then that's like the one that's the person that you say oh that's what it takes to direct but look at well you can actually be quiet and yeah absolutely absolutely absolutely you know it's and it's always fascinating to me to see the different personalities as well and to see how people approach their creative process and their creativity and like the things that they make um because I think that the people that are successful do exactly that where they use whatever their strengths are to their advantage if it is sort of like the quiet introspective person that just will speak when they have that one great idea or like the flamboyant extrovert like shouting out all the stuff I mean they all if they're successful they all have a good and product they're just getting there in a different way and I always find that really fascinating hmm when we talk about like confidence and and having confidence in what you do and and really heading into a shoot like say the glam but you can you can describe the glam by a little bit because it's an interesting example sure where you have to like direct so many people short period of time you have to be super confident you're working with you know every celebrity you could imagine because we're on the red carpet of what was it the emis so there's four there's four um or just does it do the glam lot for ease so it starts off with the emis then golden globes then the Grammys and then the Oscars and so we like have my own booth on the red carpet with this thing called the Syna Bolt which is a motion control system we put a phantom 4k uh phantom flux 4k camera on the end of it and it's this robotic arm that moves like 20 feet in 1.1 seconds so the camera will move super super fast we'll shoot at a thousand frames a second and then the end result is you get this really natural like dolly move but in super slow motion so cameras like moving quite a bit you get a bunch of parallax and cool effects and talents like flinging their hair and super slow motion and it's like a cool way to experience the red carpet in a new kind of a fashion but it is exactly that where you know you have you're like back to back with like big name celebrities and you have like 30 seconds to explain what's going on and they have no idea like sometimes I think that like oh maybe they have seen it or whatever and they might have an idea but it's like they're like what is this what am I doing like how like you would and you need to be you know like you can get hurt like that thing is flying like at them you know it means like you need to like you know explain that it's dangerous explain the parameters be personable like make it enjoyable for them because it's like if I have an attitude or something's not going right then they're gone publicist pulls them it's even happened where they'll come I've explained the whole spiel they'll come up they're standing on the thing and I'm like ready to go through to one action and pop this is like no they gotta go and they pull them out and like so the environment is crazy I think it's like it's fun and exciting but like it's it's it's it's tiring on your brain to say the least you know to mean but the you know the thing you mentioned about confidence is you know I think that there's something to be said about I mean I think fake it till you make it is sort of like the wrong term but the idea of like if I'm nervous like being nervous is only gonna be a detriment to me so I should just ignore the fact that I'm nervous and like just focus on a task at hand and then that will empower me to do a better job because you know if I'm if I'm nervous being nervous about it is like only gonna hurt me right and so I think it's like really important to like as far as confidence goes like yes I feel like I can do a good job but just to be in the right headspace to sort of do the best version of whatever it is that I can you know and I think that really helps a lot so it's not necessarily like faking it but it's like putting your mind in the right place to do your best job in that moment is really helpful yeah I think a lot of people suffer with like the imposter syndrome to feel like they don't belong or like they're they're not worthy to be there there's probably going to be element of that in the beginning uh I can't let it for sure yeah and as you're doing projects that you're like oh I don't know if I'm you know I don't know if I'm ready for this because you have to inevitably do those shoots and work on those projects that feel like a huge leap if you want to progress and move forward of a job making a film is like when it's done it's done you're not going back and reedited and you're not going back and changing the color it's like when that paint dries that's the end of it you know to me and so there is something quote unquote perfect about the idea that like you finished it and it's done and it's perfect for the time that you made it so like I like that it's more of like an acceptance of perfection the idea of like the traditional like 10 out of 10 perfect I've never really like subscribe to that train of thought because you're always in ever we're just going to be left disappointed you know to because the day five minutes when you call rap you like oh I should have done this you know you're instantly like thinking back in hindsight of like what you could have done and in the edit you like oh there's this shot or that shot and so I'm far prefer to like look back and recognize the things I want to change and I would change or things that I could do better or things that I now have a deeper understanding for now but it's like I like to look back on my past work and be like that was as good as I could do at that time and that's as perfect as I can strive for there's no more perfect version than that you know what I mean and I think that that is helpful because I hit the idea of like looking back and like beating myself up because I've done it on my work I'm like oh god like that shot or this thing or that edit you know it's like of course I've done it and I'm like it's not servicing me in any way it's making me feel bad about something I should be proud of and it's like making me focus on the past instead of the future so it's not helping in any way you know yeah it's like when people ask you for feedback on their work like if somebody's a filmmaker that's been doing it for a year I'm going to look at that through different eyes I'm not going to look at that like this is somebody that's been working for 20 years or maybe like constructive feedback in a certain way a lot of times people just need like an encouragement and just say hey just keep like you're doing amazing work just keep going and I think that we should also look at ourselves in that same light it's like when we're looking at work that we've done years ago it's never going to stack up well we're currently doing it if you're getting better it shouldn't you know or if you have a problem if it was the same yeah you're not going anywhere yeah you know what I mean so I think it does take a little bit of like forgiveness and being polite with ourselves and this ourselves because we can be our own worst critics it's hard to gain perspective on your own work though because of those reasons exactly but even when you're mentioning like looking into other people's work I think that one of the insights that that you and I can gain or sort of have gained over our experiences like picking out the things that how can I say this like are the keys that would help in their success right so it's like sure it's like maybe the they cross the axis or like they light something wrong but I'm like you'll figure out that technical crap that that's not a worry but if I've seen stuff where it's like technically wrong but I can tell they have a good eye and I'll give them feedback on that because it's like that I think can be can come through even with like technical misapps or like poor beginner mistakes you know what I mean I've seen work for people that I'm like I get sent real as a bunch you know I mean I'll watch them and I'll try to give them my two cents and and some people where it's like it's technically not great but they have a style they have like an eye and like that you can pick out and you can sort of like encourage them with that kind of a thing too which I find often really really helpful right I think like in those situations it is like a delicate balance between wanting to encourage people but then also not just saying you're perfect you're great you're done you don't even like because I think people that are hungry and that do want to improve they want to know like where where do you think that are my shortcomings where do you think I can work on better like you're somebody who's got 10 years experience and you've got a way better eye than me. When I moved to LA I was I'm still in friends with a bunch of dancers like I'm in the dance community and so I would talk to dancers who'd done a ton of music videos a ton of commercials and I'd ask them about their experience working the directors who was good who was bad and a prevailing theme that always came up was like poor directors were ones that could not make decisions and good directors were ones that could make decisions and it was always when they're like oh the set was a mess because the director like couldn't decide or couldn't figure it out or like he in high and changing their mind and I was like okay and then when they're like oh the director was great he knew what he wanted he communicated you communicated it clearly and like we had a great and so from then on I was like I need to empower myself to make the best decisions and sort of be able to like just be decisive on things because that seems to be like a thing that will really help someone in their career and and in turn I believe it really has being decisive is like the number one thing you can do to be on time on budget and make make something cool. What do you think it is that prevents people from making decisions? I mean they just don't want to make the wrong one right you know what I mean so and I think that like it's it's I don't think that there's something inherently bad about making a quote unquote wrong decision if you commit to it you know you can I mean it definitely obviously depends on how bad of his decision is but for the most part it's just like you like should you be on this left side or should you be in the right or do you want to be high do you want to be low should we push in or should we pull out like those kinds of things it's it's yes there there might be an objective we write decision but like if you make the wrong one in those sense it's like not the end of the world and your far better serve to just make one and commit to it you know to mean and so I think that and if you can't make the decision it's because of a lack of knowledge on your standing right like a push in and a pull out is going to feel different to the viewer if you don't have enough experience to know how that feels different then you're not empowered enough to make that decision so it's like it's it's experience really that that can and that can give you the information to make that decision but even if you don't know if you just pick one and it's just like that's even better than not deciding in my opinion you know what I mean because that's going to slow things down and then people are going to be confused and be like I don't know what the you know it's like that just causes a ripple effect on set and it's very much like a top-down thing on set if your director or if you is sort of like kind of all over the place mentally or like can make up their mind it's like every department head is then scrambling because they don't know what they want and like everybody below them is scrambling and it just creates a frenetic environment that is not conducive to having a good end product yeah so it seems like it's the experience will help you make the right decision or at least the decision that's going to best service the vision that you've come up with for this project like you said you know there are certain things when it comes to filmmaking that will make the viewer feel a certain way and like a director's trying to make them so if they want to feel like this is a really tense situation you might push in you might go close up or whatever and that stuff is going to come with experience and really understanding what you're doing but no matter what like you said you need to be able to have that mindset of I'm going to make decisions I'm going to make quickly and I'm going to be efficient about it is there something about is there a certain kind of is there something you can do before heading into a shoot that will allow you to make decisions better and more quickly is there a certain amount of preparation that you can use in going into shoot where you be like well you automatically know that you're going to be saying no to a like this certain direction because you've already got to focus sure yeah that's a really good question I don't know if there's a thing that you can do to help you make decisions more quickly on set obviously being prepared is the number one thing because if you're not prepared then you're just going to have more questions right so the more you can prepare the less questions you have and the less questions you have the easier you can tackle them right if you come to set you get asked 50 questions like if you're not prepared you're going to get asked 150 and then you're never going to get overwhelmed and then that becomes problematic right so doing all the standard things of like having a plan shotless like being clear with what you want but it's like you're always like that's the other thing I realized is that like a director like your job is to answer questions like that's your job people will be like stay here should do this or have this light here should what color should this be you know to mean like your job is to provide those answers so I think that I think knowing that and like we've we stated it's just like committing to being decisive on it is better than than a wrong choice or being un-dicisive but I also think that it's like it's very much like a muscle you know what I mean I think that that's a thing being decisive can be a thing that you can excel at and progress at and become better at it's so frustrating for everybody around you whether it's a friend or if it's on you're on a crew and you're like can you just make a decision like like somebody has to make a decision where are we going out to eat tonight like can you just and if you get into a place where it's just like you know like saving that example like going out to eat tonight make a decision maybe you pick Chick-fil-A maybe it was a mistake maybe you were granted to hours later but at least you're you ate you there exactly exactly exactly and I think that's sort of like that's a good example because if you if you look at that like going out to eat with a bunch of friends and it's like there's nobody there to make a decision like how quickly do you waste time do you argue dispute and it's like an hour will go by and you still haven't left you still haven't gone to eat but it's like you know obviously doesn't work where there's one person in charge of your group of friends unless you structure it that way there is one person on charge in charge on set right and so if you imagine take that react that sort of environment that we've all experienced and you apply that to set if you can't figure out like you know what you're doing or where you're going to go eat on set it's like you're just in just as much of a cluster fuck on set as you are with your friends trying to decide where to go eat right so that's just like it's even more important because it's like time and money it's not just your evening that you're wasting you know was it challenging to go from a position where you are a solo crew to directing larger crews and directing talent yes and no I mean there there was a slight progression with obviously moments of like big jumps where you we show up to a set and you're like oh there's 20 more people now than last time right but last time there was like eight people and now there's 28 so it's like there was definitely a progression where you know we started to get a couple crew in I'd have you know two three people help me out and then I have five people help me out then then we have 10 people there and then you know then there was like 25 people there so there's a couple moments there's a couple jobs where the crew got exponentially bigger and in that moment it's sort of like not scary but it's sort of like just sobering in the sense you're like oh like this this one's for real like there's a lot of people here like you're in charge like again don't let that the nerves get to you just focus on like what you need to do you still need to like create clips and shots of things that you need to make a cool video at the end and that's the same thing I was doing when I had one friend with me you know what I mean and so like two examples are like the first Katy Perry videos I did so for her California Dreams World Tour there was a short film that played throughout her concert that was like seven segments that were act breaks in between the show that told the continuous storyline of like the story of she was like she worked in a butcher shop and she wanted to date this baker's boy and open up her own bakery and so I wrote and directed this almost short film that played in between her whole concert right and so that was like I'd done some stuff obviously with like smaller crews but that was like a three-day shoot with like all these different stats a huge build and like four major artists for a world tour like the pressure was definitely on and like going in having discussions with you know the gaffer and grip when there's like you know three and three or maybe we had four and four on that when we had a big crew it moved fast it was like a little intimidating and that was definitely one of those moments where I was like am I an over my head on this one you know what I mean but it was just like it was it was an interesting experience and and I I didn't learn some lessons that I had to learn later like what I would what I sort of would do because of not my lack of confidence but because I was sort of like had those moments of self self doubt or or more so like not enough information and slash experience I'd rely on the department heads a lot for things so they would come to me with questions they'd like oh like wish we do this for sure we do that and I would go like what do you think like what do you think we should do right and they would get what you sense and you have to say so totally like if I have no idea I'm like what do you think we should do and I think like that that's fine because it's like I'm not you know you're not expected to know everything and and they're there because they're professionals at their craft and they can provide insight and experience right and so but I what I feel like I did on that one was like rely on them a little too much you know what I mean and I think that that ended up becoming a bit problematic to the point where on later shoots for other things you know if I I would ask their opinion and I would have a gut feeling of like doing something else and I'd be like oh but they're like they're been gaffing for 20 years they know what they're doing and I would I would sort of do their recommendation and then later regret it and be like I should have listened to like what I knew I wanted to do inside and so the lesson for me became you know like having enough confidence to like be in a just not a disagreement but have a different choice than your department heads and sticking to it because you are confident that that's the right decision even though they're leaning another way so I sort of like lean too far to rely on them to then my my trick was like a trick but the thing I had to learn was sort of like then regaining my confidence like later on in my career being like oh no like stick to your guns on what you really want because it's like it's your vision and what you need to do right especially if you try to do something creative a little bit different these people that have been doing it for 20 years um they have a certain set of skills but what you're bringing to the table is a little bit different like your vision and your eye but that's very difficult to to be able to step out of that and to be able to go against what they're painting absolutely and that and that took me learning how to be really confident in my decisions like we've been talking about conferences whole time you know and and just like just owning your decisions and being okay like having that realization of being like okay like I'm going to stick to my guns on this and it might be the wrong decision but it's like this is what I'm feeling and and it's always a balance because I think that going either way too far is problematic if you sort of like always rely on there inside it's like you're never really creating your own thing but if you're so regimented in your way in your vision that's also problematic so it's like it's always about finding a balance and just trying to be open to what the best decision might be but like if you have a if you have a thought for what you want to do like you are the director it's like make your decision and go with it you know there's a hierarchy built into those those situations on set where it's it's pretty clean cut you got to call she and then everybody knows who they're reporting to and usually there's not much stepping on toes but you can still screw up as a director as a leader so like how do you come on set and like have people respect you decisions that you're making but also make sure that it's enjoyable experience because we've all worked with people that have been unpleasant and that haven't you know you wouldn't want to work with again yeah I mean you know as far as respect on set you have to earn it or you have to like earn to keep it I think that even if you're walking into a set and it's all new people they're going to inherently respect you until you start like disregarding or if you're like a dick or until they lose it you know to mean like if they don't start and even with you if you don't respect them and then or say like you have to walk to the table with like a level of respect for everybody underneath you in the hierarchy down to the PA's you know what I mean and that should be returned and but like it can go away quickly if you are a dickhead or you know you don't know or it's like you just become problematic or if you're not showing them respect then you're going to lose all their respect right so that it's I mean it's a tricky thing that I think is solved with just being a nice person that that puts effort into being good to work with you know the thing that I've noticed in NLA is that a lot of the really successful people are genuinely like kind creative nice individuals and I've I the examples of like these tyrant directors who it's like my way or the highway is very few and far between and and I have seen some that work but it is a stressful work in environment and I never want my job to be like that you know what I mean and so I've always just tried to approach it a little differently and and I think to like I think that helps me as I generally work with a lot of the same people I have a few DPs that I work with all the time and then you know a couple producers and it's like we round up the same caterers the same sound people and it's like we know how each other work we all enjoy it and that really really helps in keeping the mood and on set light which I think is really important because yes you're there to make a good product but but a large part of it is the process too and like if you are again frazzled or upset or just like going crazy on set it's not fun for anybody and then their craft suffers urine product suffers so it doesn't again it doesn't serve your vision of like creating something great if the process is problematic or struggling you know when you're looking at like the comparison of like the big budget stuff versus the small budget projects or even say projects that you work on by yourself that are just for fun whether it's vlogging or it's just you know short YouTube videos do you find that sometimes the bigger projects can get kind of it's more difficult to execute on the vision sometimes you are you hoping like like man I wish we didn't have like 50 crew 50 people here like we could this could have been so much more fun or intimate or we could have been able to do something cooler if it was just five people we could have been more nimble sure obviously there's a time in place for each but I'm curious if there's been those times where you wish that you kept things or you wish it would impossible to keep things simpler I mean it's sort of inevitably happens but again it's one of those things where I'm like you know if I'm on set with 50 people wishing we had five there that doesn't help me execute what I want to do with 50 people you know what I mean so I try to keep those types of thoughts even if I have them just sort of at bay and and I really I guess I think a theme that sort of was in coming up is just like really focusing on what your end goal is you know and and ruminating on things that could have or would have been do you know help in that moment you know it's good to have like a post-mortem and look back on what you did and then realize like okay like maybe we didn't need this or maybe we didn't need that it is what it is on set you can't necessarily change your structure and so you just have to figure out the best way to get it done and I think that's actually a thing that I enjoy like those little challenges on set finding your creative solutions with the means that you have and that's either being understaffed or overstaffed you know it's like up to you to figure out the creative way to get to get you and your crew to where you need to be and I like that challenge I like being understaffed and being like we're gonna figure out like exactly what to do to get all the things that we need to get this shot and when you're overstaffed and there's like craziness and like all this stuff going on it's like to how to how to rain it all in and focus everybody and like get everybody on the same page to then become efficient as this sort of behemoth crew I like both challenges on that yeah do things always go wrong like when you're working like you look at like every shit you had like isn't it all problem solving like have there been many shoots we were like well I went exactly as I expected it to not many I mean there has been there has been some you know to mean but only unlike like like the what I just did this shoot for Garnier with many more and she's it was a lot it was it was sort of like a half PSA for I don't know if I'm allowed to say what it was but it's sort of like a good cause a charity thing and so a lot of it was sort of like just PSAE where she's explaining the benefits of doing XYZ right and so um she's reading from teleprompter and she just nails it unbelievably well and we like we had her scheduled to do stuff after lunch and we shot the whole thing before lunch and it was like everything would look great and Clion was happy and she was happy we got her out of there we wrapped her away and so but that was like a super simple shoot right if there's ever any complexity with though there was no that one is no figuring out it's like teleprompter is going to be here and like she's going to look at Cameron read the thing you know so on those really simple shoots I think that that can happen when you started to get to creative types of things where there's a lot more variables it never goes as planned but where you deviate from your plan is often where you find bits of magic I find you know so there's always going to be these shots that you sort of discover on set that will then inevitably put you a little behind schedule but like those are kind of the best shots on set and then as far as things going wrong like yeah every time there's sort of going you know of course right and you're right in the sense of like it is problem solving always even when it's going right you're still problem solving unlike how are we getting these six shots before we got to move on you know and so I think that that's a part of the job and that's a thing that you should embrace because for the most part it never goes to plan you know in a minute it's always this new random thing or like we don't have this or we don't have that and it's again your job to figure out a solution to make it happen hmm what kind of things are you excited about in terms of both avenues like the original stuff you're making and the big stuff like do you have any crazy ambitious goals project of course of course I mean you know for me it's like the goals always been you know like long form narrative features kind of the goal right and so that is a thing I'm obviously excited about but what we know with the short form digital space what I think is really cool and fascinating is sort of being able to like cure it your own audience and like be in charge and in control of it and and create something that then gives you this new value when you're out pitching bigger things so we we were touching on this before it's just the idea of like creating your own audience and and having these this built in you know group of people that are into your work is super valuable these days so that is really exciting and not just like for the value but like I've been having a lot of fun with YouTube because it really is getting me back to like how I started when I just made videos for fun and like had some crazy idea and went out and shot it and then showed it to my friends and now I put it online and so that is like invigorating to me where it's like just me and a camera making some cool stuff so that it's that's like just inspiring it's like getting back to your roots you know what I mean and it's stepping away from like because as I mentioned before it's like you know half the job now is directing is like a managerial thing where you're like working with client and agency and like all these people involved and it's your job to like crowd them all to then get this cool video it's like the idea of like cutting out all that just you figuring something out is like super fun and energizing for me these days yeah and I'm interested to see where it's going to go too because you you take a look at the way that media is changing and you know it's everything is going online and if your podcast can get a million downloads per episode what's the difference between that and you know a million views on a on a film or on a TV show I will tell you this the difference is the gap is shrinking rapidly you know what I mean because and the only thing holding it back is our conceptions of what these two things mean and again as we mentioned before like we still hold on to those two you know to me and it's like looking back on other forms of non-traditional media I think we all hold biases on being like adds to YouTube you know to me like add it's like just this but these gaps in between digital content TV social features are all shrinking and you can see it with talent you know like you know 10 years ago a movie star would not do TV ever you know to mean a film director would never direct an episode of TV they're very separate and then I mean digital didn't even really exist but now it's like even those gaps are shrinking the idea of like someone being you know there's there's people that are more popular on social platforms than like traditional movie stars so it's like everything is just shifting in all sort of becoming one thing and that I think is like for better for worse you know to me I think there's some pros that and there's some cons to that but that is inevitably where we're going to and so that's also been one of those driving forces where I'm like if I if I not if I want to sustain myself but there's an opportunity to sort of like to harness how the landscape of this industry is changing and like I don't want to let that pass me by so I'm like I'm in on this social digital stuff you know yeah I think it's I mean we saw it with Napster and like all these the music industry not being able to adapt and like as creatives you need to be able to adapt and I still think it's pretty early I mean as far as like YouTube goes and creating content like being able to cater to both platforms because like in 10 years who knows I mean the biggest like the if you asked like I think I just saw this recently it was like certain demographic like 13 to 18 or 25 whatever like really young whatever that Gen Z is I think it is if you ask Gen Z like top 10 celebrity or famous people and most of them are YouTubers oh yeah and it's like that's a huge shift I mean if you think about where it's going to go in 10 years it doesn't matter they're going to want to be able to consume content and it doesn't have to be on TV or on Netflix absolutely I think there was this report by this company called awesomeness TV and they talked about stats like that and one that I found super fascinating was asking Gen Z what they wanted to be when they grew up and so doctor was still on there uh engineer was still on there but what was off was like pro athlete and and like movie star and what was on was like YouTube vlogger and professional gamer and I'm like oh that's like they don't want to be movie stars anymore they want to be a gamer or they want to be like a YouTube celebrity you know what I mean so it's like it's quickly changing because this has just been you know you think about it too right it's like the idea of some being famous on YouTube and having a large amount of success is the past five years right like that's just like recently but for someone who's 15 today was 10 five years ago so like you know they're entering their teens and they're formulating their view on the world from 10 if like that's their whole life you know I mean like when you're 15 like what you did when you were nine doesn't even exist you know I mean you're like you know who I am is the past few years and so for someone who's been living in this world for their adult life it's like they don't even know what a movie star is it's like they consume all their media online and so it's it's I think it's changing fast but I I'd also think it's changing really faster than like the industry business structure is changing fast but the culture is changing even faster I think yeah I mean you got will Smith on YouTube like that's a huge step and a huge leap in terms of like what that means for for creating and consuming content and also he's doing it in a way that like a YouTube would do it you know there's definitely a lot of celebrities that are like have YouTube channels but they're like the theme of that celebrity is not like they're actually creating content and you know I mean as much as like Will Smith has a team behind and working on these things I think it is a step in that direction and like I mean I think he always even said like you know obviously he's done all these massive films but the thing that everybody always recognizes him from all over the world is the fresh prince it's like because it's like an intimate experience to watch television in your home and now that's what we have with YouTube it's like people watching it in their apartment they have a deep connection with these people like in a way you feel like you know them and in a way you do know them yeah I'm just really excited to see where it's gonna go well it's interesting that you you talk with that that connection because you know at you're 100% right where it's like everybody who grew up with that show has like a personal connection with all of those characters on that show right because there wasn't all this other media like that was a media we're getting you know and like it's it's inhuman nature to create personal connections with people that you see that you're familiar with that like are in your world and so you know historically in your world is like one-on-one person a person but you know with TV in your world could be the shows that you watch so it's like everybody has that personal connection with Will Smith from the fresh prince and so now we're watching all this media and there's people that are putting out you know vlogs every week or every day or whatever it is and are and are speaking to the viewer in so much of a a way that fosters more connection like they're literally talking directly to the viewer that only makes stronger connections and with so much media and that being the stuff that is so easily accessible it's no surprise that like those that type of media is connecting with today's youth a lot more than like a TV show because you know an absence of one-on-one discussions be it through a screen or in person you know a TV is not that personal they don't talk to you they go that you will just watch them live their lives right and you sure can feel a part of it over a long time you're involved in the story but like when someone like showins like yo I woke up today and I did this I did that and I'm gonna go here you're like oh you're with them and those personal connections are so much stronger and I think that that's we're still doing the same thing but it's just so much easier to be connected to those people now yeah and I think that at that same time we're seeing a trend in terms of vulnerability especially when it comes to like masculinity because like men being open with their emotions you don't have any for generations such as being holding things down and then now like you see all these people whether it's vloggers or whatever people on YouTube just sharing their emotions being honest and open with their audiences yeah and that's just that's gonna drive a deeper connection with that totally and I think you know there's so many really really cool benefits of of this social content in YouTube and I think that's one of them you know to mean like having an open discussion about you know masculinity and the identity of men I think has been this like structured thing that people have sort of like held on to for years that again I don't think is necessarily been servicing men so it's like this new media and like people even like think it happens a lot through like hip hop and rap music you know what I mean because that's a community that has been holding very strongly to this idea like super ultra masculine guys and you have like Drake out there singing about different things that sort of affect him emotionally that's been a big message I think you know for someone who and he's a good he's a good person for that because you know when he can like rap sort of like as hard as all the other rappers but then he'll sing about something sort of like what he's going through and just just consuming that and understanding that someone that you look up to is being open and like vulnerable has a large effect on today's youth in my opinion I'm not quite I'm a little above the youth but like I still notice a difference in that you know it's like nobody's people are doing it now but nobody before him was really doing that and I think it had an effect on pop I mean he's not a hip hop he's a pop artist you know I mean it's pop culture at this point and I think he's had an effect on sort of like a youth today and in an extension of all of this content of of people just being open to camera I think has been helpful in a lot of ways yeah and I think you're going to see it just go even deeper and deeper especially with like you say when people who you look up to the ones that are at the top of the game that are either like Will Smith vlogging or you got Drake that's actually getting like emotional and talking about his feelings like that that stuff is like I think it's important and it's like it's it's servicing your art it's like you're able to put yourself into your work and then I mean not to say that everything we create has to be like intense and deep whatever because I think that there needs to be a balance and like you you know I want to create content and I want to consume content that's also fun and light yeah and it's good that like you know we're as we're talking about the topic of men that like that is now an avenue for you to do that should you want to where I think is before is like if you know like if there wasn't this cultural change but YouTube existed and you came out and just started talking about your emotions people would be like what do you do you know so but it's just good that that's a possibility now you know what I mean and so I think that and I think that that's a part of I mean I'm sure culture across the board is sort of like evolving but I think a little bit in part of like what we're talking about as far as social and this like fostering these interpersonal connections through the internet it it reads this openness and vulnerability which I think is a good thing what do you think will help people cut through the noise whether it's you know traditional trying to get a directing job or like I think more interesting is like if you're creating if you're content creator online when you have thousands of other people who are putting stuff out there how do you separate yourself from them you know that's a great question and I think that the the answer is sort of like a cliche one where it's like you know nobody is you you are an individual with your own distinct voice your own distinct experiences like nobody has nobody's life is has been the same as yours you have this unique perspective and I think an important thing is like harnessing what that perspective is and being able to communicate that like that can be tricky like being able to express your voice but your voice is so unique and and distinct to you that if you can find a way to showcase that you will inevitably be different than everybody else and I think that's just an important thing to keep in mind because we all struggle with this idea that like you know you can't stand out or you don't have anything new to offer or there isn't anything sort of quote quote special about you like we've all had those thoughts but the idea that you you are an individual that does have its your uniqueness is in your experience finding a way to communicate that I think is really valuable. I also heard this one piece of I wish I could remember who said this but what's better than being good is being different and that really resonated with me because it's new when it's fresh and there's value in that so it's a thing that I've sort of been trying to figure out how to implement in my career a little bit more but it's an interesting thought that being different is better than being. Well yeah like to be able to have your work speak for itself that somebody sees it and it's not just like a slick car commercial like that's good that's great it's beautiful yeah but like what makes it weird what makes it like unique and I think those are the kind of things that we need to lean into because that's the the the the path that's not necessarily safe especially when you're working with a client and you're trying to pitch them on this like really weird silly idea and you're like listen like it takes a lot to be able to stand up for those kind of crazy ideas sometimes it's not going to work a lot of times it's probably not going to work but that's cool like I think we need to encourage each other to just like take risks absolutely like take risks and just sort of like find what makes you an individual and like as cliche as that sounds like that's really the way to go because you know like we all learn the same three light setups you know to mean like we all learn the same technical things you know to mean but it's like it's your individuality that is really going to make it different and and create a different style tone and like flavor and what you're doing and I think that everybody's value whatever that value may be relies on that and then I think is like really an important thing to recognize and harness because people worry about technical stuff so much people worry about resolutions so it's just like all this stuff and I'm like it doesn't it matters a little bit but like what are you doing to sort of like showcase your voice because that's the thing that nobody else has everybody else got red camera everybody's got DSLRs yeah I mean but like nobody has your voice right it matters in a way that if we never upgraded our camera from the HVX back in the day you were going to get jobs today if that was the camera you were still shooting with trust me this is like my my vision I'm going to use this like shoot to tape but like apart from that like you can now get a camera that's like three four years old for really cheap on eBay that is just as good quality level as the cameras today and like it's shrinking every single day but like you said it's it's it's it's so small the difference in terms of the quality and like yeah it doesn't it doesn't really it doesn't really matter I mean I think like having the coolest latest stuff is cool but that's never I've never gotten a job because I'm like oh I have master crimes in an area like I've never got a job because of that you know what I mean I don't have those but if you know if I did or but like you know with gear with like I've never sold a job on any sort of technical thing you know what I mean I think a lot of people think that that's what they need like people think well if I get this red camera then I'll book more gigs like is that true of cinematographers or DPs versus director okay so there's a slight argument for that for a DP I'll say yeah because for me you know if I'm because we're shifting away from the from the traditional like post house or rental house kind of business model if I can hire a DP that has a camera and lenses like has a camera package I would prefer to give them the money then to go to a corporation or even just a big company that someone owns you know and have them take that rate and you know have their mark up and all that kind of stuff you know it makes me feel better to like give it to somebody so it's like it's easier for me and it's simpler where I don't need to send someone to go prep at the rental house and like it's like logistically easier if a DP owns it so in that sense it can be beneficial but I don't I would hate to for people to take away being like oh you got a biocamera to be a DP like you don't and even when we're talking about sort of like YouTube creating your own content it's like you need to own a camera to make something but again it's like that can't and shouldn't be the thing that you're focusing on to get work you know I mean like oh I got a camera you should hire me it's just like can you use the camera well and you should you know like you make a simple thing is yeah like you I was just helping my sister get set up because she's trying to buy a camera and get into that side of things and we you can look up footage online you can see really great footage with that lens combo with that camera but I'm like it's gonna take a while before you can shoot it like that exactly you can't just pick it out and go in auto and imagine that it's gonna look the same or that the way the edit's gonna come together but definitely don't let the camera be the barrier that stops you to get into it oh yeah yeah no definitely I mean I might there's a couple of couple of scenes that I like with respect to this is that the best camera for you is the one in your hand so be it an iPhone or DSLR or a red camera like that the one that you have in your hand that you're shooting with is by far the best so it's like if you're looking to get into it just get a camera any camera and start but then the other thing about you know having sort of the best stuff it's it's interesting how people equate your talent to your camera where it's like if you go to a dinner and like someone who cooks you this amazing meal at the end of it nobody goes like what kind of stove do you have that like you must have a great stove to be able to cook this awesome meal and you're just like that would never make sense but the number of times I show someone something dope like what camera are you using like what like what kind of camera is that I'm just like it's this but it's like that's not necessarily it makes it good you know what I mean yeah it's funny on that same note like I I know at least one who has taken like he's rented out his camera and he's used the footage shot on those projects in his real and it's like because he was his camera that shot it right oh wow how crazy is that that's insane yeah like that was it your project I mean why don't you just take any footage that was shot on that camera that was my camera that shot it um but I think that's it's something that people should know that like there's dudes it doubts that's a big deal yeah there's I mean and it's so you know with trying to get that recognition online like those lines are being broken constantly in a way that I'm not okay with like that's not okay you know what I mean and like we're all trying to like maximize what we do and represent ourselves the best but I don't know it's like it's good to have a bit of a moral compass on what you're doing and and like just don't do stuff like don't hate don't hate don't lie don't misrepresent yourself you gotta do it for the long run you can't yeah because people they're just looking for that quick short-term gain yeah and then but in the long run you're gonna lose your integrity like you can't there's certain things that you can't get back well you'll lose your integrity but you'll also like people will slowly realize it like oh this guy's not that good because it's like those amazing shots were not shot by him you know to me and so he shows up on set and you like light something horribly and they're like what happened here like that reputation will then start to catch up to him you know to mean so like my approach is like I want to do this and I want to do it right I really want to learn I really want to figure out what makes someone good how someone can excel at making beautiful images and being successful with creating their own stuff and having good relationships with brands and clients like that like fascinates me and drives me to figure out how to become truly like someone who is great at what they do I that's a goal it's not that I want to just like get a job or be this thing it's like I really thrive off that idea of finding success due to talent and like being a good person to work with and so it's never if holding those values in my mind the idea of cheating is never occurred to me and like granted it's like I'm not gonna say like I have taken some liberties in my career and even in like showcasing my work but I mean it you know it's sort of weird because it's like I'll say that you have to use your own discretion right and so there's two things it's kind of like puts me in a weird position right so it's like I'm using my own discretion on my own work with like showing what I've done and it's like that I'm keeping an alignment with me and so it's like I feel okay but what I'm showcasing but then again if you look at that guy and you're like if he does the same thing and if he's okay with showcasing that as being like his work then I'm like who am I to judge him you know what I mean I guess it's just thing like I would never do that and like I feel like doing that type of approach will definitely catch up with you and that isn't sustainable because you're not actually working are there blurry lines like what are in what are you talking about here in terms of like so I'll give you an example right so it's like I did this thing for Red Bull and so we did these we it was called parallels and we're comparing different forms of dance to different forms of extreme sports and athletics and how like grace, balance and these different sort of facets play into sort of like are beneficial to both types of movement right it was this movement based thing so we compared like a ballerina to a motor cross person and how grace can affect both of these disciplines right so we're comparing both things so I shot all the dance stuff and then with Red Bull we licensed their motor cross footage to draw the comparison so I didn't go out and shoot the motor cross stuff but I created this narrative thing that included footage that I licensed with footage that I shot and at first I was like can I put this on my real I didn't shoot it you know so like maybe I can't put it on my real but then I sort of I sort of sort of think that like this is a part of the vision that I created I created this story in this idea comparing these two things and this footage isn't a piece that I directed and created so therefore as far as me as a director I can put it in if that was like a cinematography reel I could not put it at all because I didn't shoot that but I created a piece that included that and those things of story elements and so that like that's I'm like I feel like I'm taking a liberty and showcasing that and I think that comes from like my early beginnings of like me shooting everything and holding the camera because even now when I'm directing I'm sitting at a monitor I'm not holding the camera but it's still like my job and my piece overall but definitely the time I was kind of like I don't know if I can put that in right because like if you imagine a photographer they still have are the ones usually snapping the photo yeah exactly where it's very easy to be like well he took that shot but imagine like sitting back in a chair and I guess take that photo over there like if he was here it's definitely a different it's just different slightly different world and I think it's just one of those it's a perspective shift yeah and I mean if you like think about it like Ken Burns would never be able to have a real because everything is guys is like a story footage and our kind of footage but it's like of course he would like if you needed it you could create like a sizzle or yeah and Burns needs it but how exciting that sizzle would be it's like slow motion pictures going through but yeah I mean you know it is at your discretion I guess but but to circle back to the point you know it it is valuable to sort of retain your integrity I think that in the long run that that really really plays a part in someone's success and I think that that people will gravitate towards that and that will resonate with people um sure if you throw that stuff out the window you might get a couple jobs here and there but I don't think that it's sustainable in any kind of way you've mentioned that you you have a lot of drive had you ever found that that drive has gotten in the way of your personal well being oh absolutely oh yeah definitely and and more so early in my career you know to mean I think that um yeah you know it's tough in LA it's tough to make a name it's tough to get work and so I think that you know a big lesson that I've had to learn is to figure out that work life balance I think in the past few years I've sort of come to a good balance in that but it was a thing I had to focus on you know I came to the point of like and I think everybody sort of goes through this where it's like you were working nonstop and you're like why am I working so much like I'm working just to keep working and like it's great I love it but like when am I enjoying life at all and so you know last year actually took a bunch of breaks and I traveled a bunch and it was just kind of like yeah the year before I had that realization I was like well mate what am I doing this for you know what I mean I'm just working and like earning money and like working and and like it's cool but where am I enjoying life you know and so it's definitely been a lesson to learn but even in that I will say that I think it is very valuable to to go to both extremes on this I think there's very valuable to have nothing standing your way to sacrifice everything else going in life and dive as deep as you can into a subject and to like just like immerse yourself completely I think that there's you get something out of that that you cannot get by by doing even a diligent work on something like fully fully diving in and like ignoring things in your life to get to where you want to be is really valuable you can obviously cannot sustain that for more than like a couple years you know but I do think that that's valuable once you go do that then it's like you're gonna the pendulum's gonna swing way to the other side and then you need to like chill out and be like okay I need a little break and you'll inevitably find the right balance but I think that like you know because the you know the baseline is having talent and then it just depends on you know right place right time your personality it's like who you know like all these other factors play huge role in your success like you need to just dive in as much as you can and figure out how to like how it's gonna work for you because how it worked for me isn't how it's gonna work for you isn't gonna how it's gonna work for someone else so you really need to spend that time so I think that there is it is a value but like don't please don't do that forever because you'll be ruin yourself and it will be eventually problematic but yeah a little bit is good I think right everyone's in a while you need to grind the course yeah your life to turn into a grind no yeah because then it's like then again like I said we all have that realization of like what's it for you know it's like we're all working so hard you know and it's like yes we do enjoy the process but you know at some point you're just like I'm just working myself I'm sacrificing too much for too long and it's not it becomes not worth it so yeah that's that's been a big lesson for me is to just like ease back and be like okay like you know at you know 7 o'clock 8 o'clock you like okay works done now for today I'm gonna stop and I'm gonna go do something else I'm gonna and and more so the tricky thing is not necessarily like quote unquote like putting the pen down but like not feeling guilty about putting the pen down you know what I mean because there's two different ways you can do it you can go I'm gonna stop working now and then from I like six o'clock and then from six to ten you just feel guilty the whole thing I should be like editing this thing or doing this other thing you know I mean it's like that's not servicing you either the benefit is from stopping working and then like not feeling bad about it and really enjoying your time doing something else completely other than work but that takes a second I mean always for me it took a second to like be able to do that yeah I love that advice though of finding the boundaries because I do think we need to kind of experiment a little bit and maybe push ourselves a little bit too far like you know put ourselves completely into a project where maybe we do tip the scale in the other direction yeah but then that's how you know where your boundaries are that's how you know when like okay things are getting a little bit overwhelming for me or when you're planning out a project in a deadline now you can say well I'm not gonna do this in two weeks because it's just gonna burn me out so I'm gonna you know say three weeks on totally and that's what I mean it's like it's it's there's there's value in burning yourself out once or twice you know because you know how far you can go you know what it takes and then it's like if you're ever in that situation like unwillingly you're like oh I know I can pound through this you know I think I learned that lesson in college actually you know it's like high school was fine it wasn't I I did the minimal amount of work to like get by you know but when I went to university it's like doing term papers and studying for final exams it's like I really pushed myself you know to to I needed to work hard to just get decent grades because it's a lot harder workload and so if I always say like if I move to LA like right out of high school I wouldn't have the work ethic to survive out here you know I I found out how hard I could work you know by going like by getting a degree and like doing term papers and grinding pulling on writers you know what I mean so that was it the first time my life where I really had to push and then moving to LA after that experience I was like oh I know I can do it you know because I had to go through this uncomfortable process and sort of like really really push myself to figure out how to get a B or whatever it you know to mean and so I think there's there was value in that for me and I think that um you know diving in fully and like really grinding it out you just know where as you said your boundaries are you want to do some quick questions yeah let's do it if you could go back to say like 20 22 years old is there advice you give yourself or is there something that you would do differently at that time oh um I think probably advice I'd give myself but you know I I hate the idea that I think I might have done something wrong because even in my wrong decisions for the moment I learn to a valuable lesson you know I think that there's always you know I've definitely made some things that I felt bad about or like led me down the wrong path but in going down the wrong path I I eventually figured out how to get back on the right path and there was a lesson in that so you know if I said oh go correct this or go do that I might not have learned lessons that really helped me later in life so I and I hate that idea of regret I really tried to regret nothing you know to mean every decision I've made I made the I made it to my best ability at that moment you know like I've always just been like whatever decision is like this is the best I can decide right now and so of course you end up getting you know in hindsight you you have more knowledge and more information that you maybe you should have done something different but at the time I didn't have it so I really try not to beat myself up over decisions that I've made because I was doing the best that I could at that time right as far as advice um my one piece of advice would just to be to enjoy to enjoy it more you know and I think I I think back to my early years in LA and of course it was filled with like a ton of uncertainty and a ton of stress because it's like not really working don't know if my career is going to work out try you ramen every week you know trying to figure out how to pay rent and like that's like a stressful time but it also was this time of like like the world is your oyster in a sense like anything is possible and it was really like this really invigorating period of my life that in hindsight I look back and go like that was so awesome like first coming out here and just like the whole world is new and like just like this bright eyed kid from Canada like trying to figure it out that's such a magical special moment but in that moment I was far too stressed about pain rent or doing XYZ or getting this job or that job and I don't think I had I obviously did not have the perspective to step out of that and like enjoy it but in that lesson I'm trying to apply that thought to now where I'm like I know in 10 years I'm going to look back in this period where I like live at the beach and go surfing in the morning and be like oh god I wish I could just get back there so I really try to like not stress out about as much as I can to really like try to live my life today like with the hindsight of the future I guess and so I'm even like so I would give myself that tip but I'm also I'm getting that tip from my future self right now you know what I mean that's amazing I love that yeah I think yeah that's one of the things that's really really tough because I wonder if that kind of anxiousness that kind of like you know feeling oh I gotta I gotta pay rent like I do all these things like that kind of frenetic energy is helpful early on because if he drives you to make certain decisions like I mean because here's the thing when you're first starting out I really think that you need to say yes to as much as you possibly can like you're not getting work you gotta you just gotta get experience and if something doesn't align with your values you can certainly say no but I think apart from that it's like just get work do weddings whatever you can like pay the bills and all that stuff and then get to a point where you can start saying no to certain projects but I think it does take quite a bit to be able to I there might be something to the the the fact that the struggle is a good thing I agree completely you know to me and I think that it is and that's another that's another example of like the idea of like I don't wish I did anything different for a that exact reason like I don't in some sense I don't wish I was less stressed out when I was here like early in my career here because maybe I wouldn't have worked as hard and maybe I wouldn't have done XYZ right so but they're definitely is I think that that's that it can only be beneficial where you're like worried about paying rents you're like I gotta go do a job you get experience you do more stuff you know so like it's all apart of what happens you know so yeah and I think that is definitely advice to like just try to enjoy the moments in between yeah because I can still like want to bust my ass and and be able to take a second to be like oh this is like a cool period in life you know what I mean because you never when you're in it you never look at it with the perspective of looking back right so I'm trying to like find a way to like mentally trick myself to be like no I'm like me in the future looking back and now like enjoying my life right now so it helps a little bit you know it's great is there one universal skill not exactly like you know filmmaking skill but just a skill in general that creators should be learning yes absolutely and I would say you should learn how to learn I think the one thing that has benefited me in my career is I think I can digest and process stuff well sort of like and that breaks down to learning so it's like as I mentioned like learning everything I can about every department the just the idea of learning is a skill that you can get good at you can sort of code and analyze information better and like really compartmentalized things and and break them down into bite-sized pieces that you can then understand and apply and that if you're trying to create like the more you know the absolutely the better so I would say like learning it's sort of a weird thing learning is the thing you should learn but being good at learning will well be the one thing that can apply to everything I two more questions and we'll wrap this out how do you get through doubt how do I get through doubt yeah when you're feeling like doubtful um shit I mean I think I think recognizing that everybody has it is a thing that might not get me through it but provides a bit of comfort and reassurance when you're in it so it's like if I feel doubtful or shitty or whatever we can we can swear on this one okay yeah you know just understanding that like you know my heroes are not exempt from that you know to me and I think that that that in at least is comforting enough to sort of like have it not get to me too much I also sort of understand that it is temporary you know hopefully it doesn't last that long you know and when it when it becomes to be you know we all go up and down and there's moments of like you know being on top of the world and jubilant to the extreme and then being just kind of like in the gutter and just sort of like wondering what you're even doing right but I just you know it is comforting for me to sort of remember that everybody goes through it and it is only temporary and so I really try not to draw any kind of permanent bits of identity or sort of have that affect me in the long run whereas I'm like okay I'm feeling doubtful now and this sucks because I think that I suck but like I know at some point it'll pass or at some point I'll get energized again in a new way and so I you know I do one of two things I either just write it out because I don't think that it's bad I don't think negative feelings are bad I think that it's far more detrimental to try to shun them away and think that you shouldn't feel them then just accept feeling them and have them kind of like pass through you because that can result in like bottling them up and and then becoming problematic in the future so I either just kind of being like okay like I feel doubtful or bad or whatever might be I'm just gonna I'll start the clock and like if I still feel this way in two weeks and maybe I'll do something about it and if not I'll just maybe chain refocus or you know I try not to let it affect me too much the problem is when it like lines up with something important like if you're about to do a big thing and then you're feeling doubtful that day or the weekly and up to it that becomes problematic but I think that that's just like a mindset thing you know because I definitely you know I've definitely gone into a lot of jobs where I don't feel like I'm the one or like good enough or like prepared enough but again it's like you know it's I'm like well if the days and five days I'm like in six days will have done something like hopefully like it gets done good enough you know there's one thing to like set it aside be like okay I see you there I'm gonna set you aside and there's one thing to like suppress it and be like it's not happening like everything is fine that I think is bad but like going like okay I feel doubtful but like that's not gonna help me so I'm just gonna focus on what will help me that I think is good yeah that makes sense awesome man well if people want to find you online where should we send them woo my website uh coalwalsert.com is kind of like the main
