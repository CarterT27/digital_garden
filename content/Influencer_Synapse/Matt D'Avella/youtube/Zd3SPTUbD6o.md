I’ve always been fascinated with change. Why are some people able to turn their lives around but others get stuck? Traveling the road, filming our documentary Minimalism, I found out that many I admired had struggled a lot early on. So how did they do it? How did they turn their lives around? Where did they start?

The lesson’s I learned from these interviews were thought-provoking, inspiring, and mind-bending. I’ve curated them down into a fifteen minute film I’m calling “Unstuck: The Five Steps to Change”, where I detail the specific steps, tools and strategies that these individuals used to create radical changes in their lives.

## Transcript
 In 2013, I started a project that would change my life. It teamed up with a few friends to make a documentary called Minimalism. We traveled around the country, speaking with some of the most influential writers online. Those who have inspired millions of people to change their own lives. So I'm Leo Bouta, my name is AJ Leon. I'm Tammy Strobel. I've always been fascinated with change. Why are some people able to turn their lives around while others give up? I discovered that many of the people we interviewed had at one point found themselves stuck. 2005 is when I really remember a picture of myself. I was overweight, I was unhealthy. I had gained a lot of weight, I was unhappy. I always lived paycheck to paycheck. I didn't have time to be sick, so I just started flout through it. I couldn't change any of my habits and I couldn't figure out why. So how did they do it? How did they turn their lives around? Where did they start? The lessons I learned from these interviews were thought provoking, inspiring, and mind-bending. I've curated them down into a 15-minute film, I'm calling unstuck, the five steps to change. Where I detailed the specific steps, tools, and strategies that these individuals took to create radical changes in their lives. I'm releasing this film exclusively to my newsletter subscribers, so sign up today to be the first to see it.
