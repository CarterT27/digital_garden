## Transcript
 So far, when I've gotten feedback, it's because I am open to it, but I think when you get it and you're not expecting it, that's when it could be like little. Yeah, I haven't gotten it on the iTunes reviews or ratings yet either where it's like, just as boring as shit, I hate that. Like, don't listen to this podcast, which I think I'm actually ready for it when we release minimalism. I think there was like, you can, I don't know if they still do it, but on Netflix they would have comments where you can like see what people were saying about it. And I didn't read it, but my co-producer Josh said he's like, yeah, man, like, well, because I was making fun of him because I saw somebody said that they weren't real minimalist because they used hair product and got fancy haircuts. And I was like, I was dying laughing because that kind of feedback, it's like, it obviously doesn't sting, it's just that person is insane, it doesn't get quite get the concept. But then he's like, yeah, and I saw one about you where somebody said, this would be a good documentary if they hired a good director for it. And I was like, I just thought it was funny, but at the same time you're like, damn, like, that's a burn right there. But I think you just got to take it and the bigger you get and more people that you reach inevitably you're going to rub some people the wrong way. Yeah, and I think that's part of having a good, I don't want to say brand, but it's, it says that you stand for something if you have haters because if everyone likes you, then I think that's what we call vanilla and most people like vanilla and most people like cheese pizza, even if they don't love it. Yeah, they don't, no one has hate feelings for vanilla or cheese pizza. People might have hate feelings for like blue moon with cereal chunks in it because they're like, oh, but then at least the people who love it really love it and their fans for life like die hard blue moon with cereal chunks. Yeah, I have never heard of that combination. I just made it up. Might have to try it.
