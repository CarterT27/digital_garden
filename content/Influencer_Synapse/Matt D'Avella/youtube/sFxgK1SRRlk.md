Self-Reliance used to look much different then it does today. It was measured by your ability to build fires, create a shelter & grow a beard. But thatâ€™s changed.

Today self-reliance is measured by your ability to build an audience, create information products & growing a brand.

And thatâ€™s not a bad thing. In today's video I talk about what it means to be self-reliant today.

## Transcript
 Self-reliance used to look much different than it does today. It was measured by your ability to build fires, construct a shelter, and grow a beard. But that's changed. Today, Self-reliance is measured by your ability to build an audience, create information products, and now instead of growing a beard, you need to grow a brand. And that's not necessarily a bad thing. We have this romantic view of the way things used to be. We imagine someone wearing a flannel shirt, walking through the forest with an axe rested on their shoulder. For some reason, this mental image is always slow motion for me. I don't know why. But as much as we think people are misguided or disconnected these days, the two worlds aren't very different from each other. They're both about survival. The idea is simple. Do wait around for somebody to bring you food and build you shelter and provide for you. Or do you take things into your own hands. Sure, you can fill out an application and throw it on top of a stack of 100 other applicants, or you could create your own path. If you want to make things happen, stop waiting for permission, or for someone to show you how it's done. You need to do it yourself. Your survival depends on it.
