A few weeks ago I had the idea to make an April Fool's day joke. It was going to be a fake commercial for a fake app called Nothing. See how we put it all together.

## Transcript
 We've created a new app to help you declutter from the digital world, introducing nothing. A couple weeks ago, I had an idea to make a video about nothing. A video for a fake app that does exactly what you'd expect to do. Nothing. So how do we make it? I pitched the idea to Josh, and he was like, this is f*** real, yeah. I wrote the scripts, we made some tweaks. Perfect. Then my friend Conrad and I shot and cut it over three days. This image stabilizer is dope. It allows us to get some really smooth shots in time-square. The big reveal, the overwhelm, By early takes, we're a little bit over the top. Apparently my girlfriend can act. That one's really good. And so can Ashley, but she's actually an actress. Things got a little bit weird in the bathroom. My nephew Oliver totally fell for the app. I ran down the street like an idiot. After the first day, we reviewed some of the footage And Conrad had a great idea to end the video like this. So we went back to Times Square for a second day. Josh sent me his voice over. Matt, I'm just gonna record this all on one track, mess up, and all. And then I cut it all together. The big reveal felt a little bit flat though. The screen wasn't as bright as I hoped, so I had to mask it frame by frame And adjust the exposure. That's better. And then I sent the video over to Josh. He posted it on the internet. And that's where we are right now.
