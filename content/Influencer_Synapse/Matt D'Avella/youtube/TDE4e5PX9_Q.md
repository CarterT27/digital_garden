 80% of it, or 90% of it, is execution. Everyone has a great idea, but if you can't really ground it in terms of an execution, it goes nowhere. That's Jerry Chu, and he runs a small independent agency that's geared towards social good. And he happened to be one of my earliest clients when I was still living at home in my parents basement. If you're good at what you do, people are going to talk about it. We talk about how to get clients by strategically planning cold calls, and why being proactive is the most important skill you can develop today. If you want to learn something, you've got to do the extra homework to figure out what it is to be proactive. This is the ground up show. So tell me a little bit about some of the work that you've been doing lately, like a past year or so. So the past year has been an evolution of the last seven years of developing my startup. Because of the market has changed, what I do now is create a development for companies and brands that have some sort of social good for individuals who need assistance, whether it's a give back process. Working for an agency in the past, it's always about developing brands for profit companies. But now that I've started on my own, I have more leisure time to think about things that can actually make an impact on people, whether it's empowering them, whether it's giving back in a funding donation kind of way, or even teaching them young minds what they can do with their lives. Yeah, I think that could certainly be difficult working in the agency world where generally it's not about the greater good and it's more about the bottom line and these companies all they really care about are profits and clicks and views. So that's nice. What are some of the projects and the organizations that you've been working with in terms of kind of that give back philosophy? For sure. I think anything that you do, you have to remain authentic. A lot of the nonprofits or things that I'm involved with are actually activities that I find passionate. So there are nonprofits like I used to be an active skate blader. I used to do a lot of snowboarding. So a lot of those activities kind of embedded myself into the culture of my community. So I've been involved with stoked.org, which is a youth activation program that teaches kids basically about entrepreneurship. And a lot of these kids don't have the funds or the mentors to actually take them on a mountain or teach them how to skateboard. And so what we do is we create curriculum for them that actually teaches them how to make a skateboard, sell the skateboard to local communities so they could fund their own trips to go to the mountain. And then we teach them how to snowboard or skateboard. And a lot of these kids don't have never even seen snow. Yeah. You know what's so cool about? It's funny because maybe this is just more so growing up like through the 80s and 90s. It's like the skaters were seen as these rebellious kids and even people who were in a metal or rock and roll. But in reality those have some of the the tightest knit communities. Once I became friends with some skaters and and bladers like they very much it's something that was supportive people that you'll meet. Yeah, 100%. I think you know in the beginning like anything else there are clicks. When blading came into the scene it was always seen as the outcast because it was kind of new where a skateboarding has always been there and started creating an laying a foundation. But once when you know you stuck through it a lot of the skateboarders in that community you also see you know saw how rugged you were into it. And at the end of the day when you bleed everyone bleeds you know and when you make a trick happen because you don't give up they give you respect for that. Yeah, even to try it. And I do because I I actually bladed a little bit because I couldn't skate. The skateboard is like a bit of a steeper curve to get into. I think roller blading is a little bit easier for me to grab my head around. But I remember like around 10 or 12 going to a skate park with my cousin and he was very good. I was not. I had never gone down like a five foot ramp before even a three foot ramp and then to get up there and to go down a five foot ramp for the first time after just like learning how to skate people give you like a lot of credit and respect because I felt right on my ass. Right down like I think I still have a scar from that day. Oh yeah, but like they they do have like they give you so much support for failing. Oh yeah, I mean they'll even guide you in terms of how to do it. I think that the community of action sports has always been about teaching because at the end of the day you're going to fall and you know everyone wants to figure out how to do it because no one's ever kind of pioneered that you know if you're going to do something and fall off the ledge it's not like you might know the routine but at the same time it's a new trick. So every kind of endeavor is a new opportunity to either succeed or fail. Yeah and you're going to fail a lot because it is it's very much muscle memory so the only way to learn is to just keep doing it. Total I mean you know with all the videos the skate videos or action sports videos of snowboarding you know you get that one shot right and everyone sees these collective views of all the successful attempts but what they don't see is behind a footage where there's a resilient more falls you know and that one successful one. That's what I love about some I've seen some skate videos where like they do the kind of tricks where they land it in the beginning and then you have the outtake real at the end which is like them doing that same exact take like 15, 20 times in failure. Oh yeah and I apply that I mean that's that's an application and what I apply towards you know how I live my life and how I run my business you know it's very much so like an entrepreneur life you have to fail at so many attempts in order to do that you'll have that one success. Yeah you know you just have to you know not give up and just keep on going. Yeah and in a way I do think it's a little bit more difficult in the entrepreneurial world because it's less socially acceptable to fail because it in a lot of ways our businesses and our freelance careers are our lives and as to where some people you might be able to separate a nine to five job from your life oftentimes as a freelancer you're working seven days a week you're you're putting in extra hours and it really bleeds they bleed into each other. So if you're failing in your freelance career in a lot of ways it feels like you're failing in life. You had difficulties over the years in terms of kind of coping the two of those of like the your freelance life and your life life. Yeah I'd say you know that's probably the hardest part in general whether or not you're you know having a startup and having to figure out what that balance is it's like even if you work at a nine to five job you're going to have a bad day at the end of the day you're going to go home right and whether you whether or not you're going to see a loved one or you're going to see family or you can see friends you don't want to take that baggage or stress with you to to your next kind of meeting or hang out right so you kind of have to figure out how to separate that that takes a lot of time that takes a lot of trial and error I mean there are days when you know you do that and if you have really good support system and good family and good friends they'll put in your place you know they'll either ask you what's going on or they'll say you know what you got to snap out of it let's go out and let's do something fun and so you know there are a lot of de-stressing moments where you know if you have a good support system to kind of talk through it or you know find a hobby right go to the gym yeah actually that's a great point even um like I was saying before the podcast I started doing soft play softball a couple years ago this was like actually it was last year that I really got back into it and then joined up with this team they're all great like we're all free agents nobody knew each other going into it and then now we're all good friends but it's something that is not career driven it's not business driven it's nothing we just nothing but we actually enjoy it to go out and play softball and have fun and it's I think as you get becoming adult you forget to have fun yeah and then to do that I think it's gonna positively affect every other aspect of your life because you're it's it's sometimes it is discouraging if you do continue to keep failing but then to realize that that's not everything that's not you know you can separate the two of them yeah and I think it's actually harder now I would say you know I started my career back in 2000 and so you know I would say that's more like the old school world where is more foundational learning you learned from the textbooks there were traditional methods in terms of what print media was what you know TV radio broadcasting was whereas now there's there's so many new platforms out there social media right um there's internet which there was classes in that back in 1990 yeah that we were taking classes on internet I think the the acceleration of where technology has gone and how you can put forth content immediately it doesn't leave a lot of room to to find that balance because you're seeing reactions instantaneously whereas in the past you put out a print out you put out TV you know commercial you might get residual feedback a week later where is now you're getting instantaneously so what you're doing is you don't have time to process you know you're reacting versus thinking digesting yeah and actually running ahead I'm new for that yeah that's a really great point because in a lot a lot of ways it's like street performing like street performers know right away what's working and what's not but I think what's difficult to understand is when you're actually on the right track but you just don't have an audience yet and nobody's people aren't listening because the word hasn't gotten out about it or people haven't caught up maybe you're ahead of the game with with something so I think that's the hard thing to grapple with and like say if you get negative feedback early on from people people start leaving comments or downloading your videos or your blog post whatever it is it can be discouraging and you may want to change what you're doing so how do you know when to listen to that audience versus continuing down a path where people are calling you crazy and saying that what you're doing is wrong because of my foundational learning and a lot of my mentors who've kind of you know paved the way to innovate in terms of where their fields are I feel like they're really too paths one if you're really passionate about something there's no there's no feedback that will ever change you off course right you look at you know Elon Moss you look at Frank Gary they don't they get reactions where people are hating on what they're doing but they don't they don't waver they just continue to go forward and they don't care if they're the only viewer audience of their own passion then there are others who have you know they need some feedback right that's like research market research you kind of need some reassurance that you know what you're doing has some support or some some community that's going to listen and I think that both are kind of true I feel like you know you always need a temperament it's like talk about ground up right you need some grounding and that's why you need your personal support system whether it's family friends colleagues that you really trust and so when you're putting out you know first kind of content out there if it's a sound a good sounding board to someone that you know who has similar relationship and hobbies and interest that you do and that's the kind of audience that you're targeting then that's a feedback you can kind of you know hint at whether or not you're going far right or far left to something right and what really stuck to me about that is is that if you look at some of the best in industry they have the more critics than anybody so if you're trying to avoid criticism the only way you can do that is to not make content and to not put stuff out there because no matter what there's going to be people that should on you and then tell you that you're wrong or tell you that you're stupid so that's that alone I think is a really good point in that and I think even in the beginning the more and more criticism you get it's probably as long as you're not like spouting like crazy it's a craziness I think it's probably a good indication that you're on the right track and that you're pushing buttons and that you have some you've said something that kind of pinched a nerve and that has gotten people to listen so it's probably a good indicator that you're on the right path totally and you know someone you know once I guess I read it somewhere someone once said it to me but you know usually when you have any comments to anything or any reaction to anything you're doing something right which means that someone's listening yeah right they have some sort of a nerve that you've pinched that says I'm going to comment on this yeah I think the only exception is the the internet trolls because the internet trolls are just looking for that that sensational reaction yeah and I think we're we're getting pretty good at identifying who's the troll who's the person who has who's providing genuine feedback or general general kind of disdain for what you're doing yeah yeah they're either haters or they're competitors yeah and which way I use that as ammo and push you know and that's when you have to push further and push faster and push harder so you're a little bit older than me you said you took internet classes in college this is a little bit ahead of the game although I would say even for me graduating college in 2010 the world is drastically different than what they prepared me for and it was very much these mass media classes and everything was radio and TV and less based around like the internet was still I think even what is this like this is like five years five years ago that I graduated still our seven years I guess still pretty early and very developing and it's drastic the changes that have occurred in the past ten years so paint that picture of of when you were in school and kind of what was the world like and what were some of these what was your experience like in college in college back back in the 90s you know late 90s internet was just coming forward I mean I was learning HTML they were teaching you how to literally put in WWW it was that was the class it was like how do you navigate I mean a lot of the a lot of the media platforms don't even exist anymore like netscape you know so a lot a lot of those things back then were about the tools in terms of teaching you how to use things whereas now I think it's it's gone so fast beyond what anyone could have even been fathomed of how it's embedded into our psyche I mean kids nowadays don't even know what a telephone a landline is because they are born with an iPhone working on apps you know I know my nieces when they were born they actually are now so savvy with the iPhone that they're teaching my parents who are in their 70s how to use an app yeah and I think that's the progression from they used to design these things it was a technology and had technical language and you had to figure out WWW and all this stuff and then it's it's become with design it's become more intuitive it's become more natural for people to be able to they want you to be able to pick up the phone and use it right away I like four years old without having any idea what you're interacting with and being able to navigate around so yeah tell me a little bit more about the those kind of classes you were taking and what did you see yourself doing in college well I was very lucky I've always known that I wanted to be in mass communications in some form of fashion I knew that I wanted to do creative development I knew I wanted to execute them in a way where people could actually be impacted by something so I took our classes in high school and went to college I took advertising I took copywriting I took you know all the traditional courses that you would marketing management and then on the other side I knew that you know with that you needed to know how to budget so I had to take the accounting courses as well yeah so you know that started to shape my left side and the right side of my brain in terms of you know you can kind of have a blue sky thinking to any concepts that you really want but at the same time it has to be grounded in a way where it can be executed because of all the you know books that I've ever read always you know how to's or entrepreneurial books or people that I've made it that have made an impact and you know they always say 80% of it or 90% of it is execution you know everyone has a great idea but it goes no if if you can't really ground it in terms of an execution it goes nowhere yeah that's something I learned is that you can read only so many entrepreneurial and how two books before you decide okay I'm gonna actually do it right right I mean you know you have all you know a lot of people have a lot of opinions I mean you and I have now I guess you know running our own ships all right or sailing our own ships and we both have different experiences we've had you know advantage and disadvantage and certain challenges on certain projects you know we could probably write our own books and there will be two different types of books but within the same topic of you know how I'm getting by day by day yeah how do you have you build something from nothing all right so how did you know that you were really into media was this like from your childhood you grew up in New York right you know so where'd you grew up in New York it's funny because you meet so many people in New York and most of the time there are people who weren't raised in New York it's very rare to find New Yorkers that have lived here in state here and what was your experience like growing up in New York and is that what what influence you to get into media yeah so I grew up in New York this is all I know you know people always ask me that question and I think the the only thing that separates New Yorkers from everyone else is just the fact that we probably grew up a lot faster you know we're exposed to a lot of things earlier on our age like I remember taking a train without any adult supervision like 11 years old dude like the 80s that was a different time that was a rough time too like you had to watch a back you know you knew that people were you know mugging people on the street you know like again you navigate the streets but you know kids are smart kids are smart you kind of you know once when you're kind of armed with that you you start to realize what neighborhoods to go into and what neighborhoods to stay away from you know it doesn't take a rocket science as to say that's a dark alley not going to go down there yeah growing up and being exposed to so many things you know I was influenced by everything you know walking down the street you saw graffiti art you know back then it was it was vandalism whereas now it's seen as commercial you know a commercial business and so I saw that and I saw the way my my dad's an entrepreneur and he ran his own business and raised four kids and you realize that a lot of it has to deal with word of mouth if you're good at what you do people are going to talk about it and so from that you would realize that there's community-based system that can actually help businesses grow and then you start to walk down a street further and you see billboards and you see TV and you see all of these outlets that kind of influence you and in this New York City mode of where you have to live you have to hustle and you have to work to figure out how you're going to make things happen and New York City is in general is probably the melting pot where businesses grew that stemmed from immigrants and you know how how you do it is not based on your education it's based on what do you know and how can you push that forward so that you can to provide for your family and you know that's kind of what's changing now is that I see less mom and pop shops and more businesses that are growing but in a good way because a lot of these businesses are young new businesses from people who have learned the new system of social media growing and growing it through other channels then the traditional ways of I can't afford a TV at you know it's like if you have an idea now and you you want to grow something you can do it and that's why there are so many new freelancers and sole proprietors who live and work in co-working spaces because it's not it's not a disadvantage now to not have an office clients now are okay what's saying oh you don't have an office no problem yeah you know do you have the experience and you know the work ethic to get my work out there at the price that I can afford yeah you know yeah it's great that that's becoming more socially acceptable because I was always very insecure about working from home for the longest time and you feel as if you're not legitimate and it's certainly changed so much now where companies will run in their entire company remotely and if you're clients doing that then why should they think feel weird about you yourself as that individual company working remotely yeah totally I mean we've seen we've seen things change in the last two years where it's been acceptable to not have an office you know I remember when I came on the scene seven years ago working on my own that was probably one of the major questions that clients were asking you know where's your office where are you based because they felt like they needed some grounding that you were gonna be here tomorrow if they page it today yeah that might be it almost has a sense of security for them right when did you so when did you graduate and when how did you first get your foot in the door at one of these agencies I started interning in college because you know I knew this is what I wanted to do I started actually interviewing my friends who were in the ad business people that I knew who worked at Gray people who knew who worked at Ogleby you know I I kind of again being a New Yorker you kind of used the network in the assets that you have and you kind of build from there and it's a very much camaraderie kind of scenario and and so when I was in college I wanted to find out who I knew in the advertising business and then because of my you know all the all the books that I read I started reaching out on my own and actually doing interviews with people who were either art directors of creative creators and they would give me their time so you were interviewing them yeah was it to under the guys of like I'm writing an article or I'm doing such and such or you just asked to interview them yeah so you know there was no scripted book or anyone told me to do that it was just you know I I looked up who they were in the publications and I would reach out and I write them in email and I would say hey you know this actually not even email back then it was it was a phone call I picked up the phone yeah I picked up the phone and and I was like I'm you know I go to school right now I'm thinking about this is where I want to go do you have a few minutes for me to just ask you some questions yeah and I still remember you know those is woman by the name of Anne Magalty I think and she worked at Crane's New York and she was an art director and she actually gave me a lot of time where she followed up she she sent me material too afterwards and so she was actually an influence if she didn't know it back then but yeah I started picking up phone calls and I started talking to people and then once when I realized that and they all worked in different departments and so from there I started to shape you know what was my interest versus you know what what guidance I can get from them and and back then it kind of was a little bit more scarier because you know when you start out as entry level you know I'm interviewing directors yeah I knew for a fact that I'll still be making copies still be running you know you still have to start from the bottom yeah that's that's actually that's great advice and that's something I think if you're in college and you're trying to make those connections like anybody can start a podcast start a blog or anything like that and a lot of these people that work at agencies they they very rarely will get contacted for an interview for like an actual publication or like a fake podcast that's blog from a college student so if you create your own platform it doesn't take long take you know a couple days to get something up and running and to get everything looking like it's you know like legitimate and professional then you can go out like you said just ask these people that you would never otherwise think about contacting and say hey can I interview you and then not only do you gain that knowledge that you learn from the interview you gain that connection down the road which could be very helpful and it's a lot easier now I think because it's social media you know I think that clients and just people in general are more it's more accepting to reach out to someone you don't know and and say hey you know I find what you're doing very cool do you mind if I ask your questions or do you mind if I intern or volunteer I think it's I think it's easier now to set things up even if you're planning on doing it on your own websites or you know you can set up a website within a hour yeah you know and set your social media brand blog or whatever you want to do a lot faster now yeah you know which I think the evolution of where you know I start is probably outdated now you know and that's what I love about our industry is that it's constantly evolving is constantly changing and if you're not moving with the times then you know it's kind of going to fall in its face but right now I feel like the way the industry is kind of evolved it's not it's not about the platforms it's about the content yeah you know and if you don't have good content that's really kind of touching somebody or someone or something then you know yeah you're right off the bat so I think there are always going to be people who find that platform first say that new platform whether it be remember my space and then there's like a few people that got on there early on like the T-Lets Achilles who necessarily didn't have the best content but they were able to develop a massive following because they were early adopters yeah that's gonna be very rare and I think that's really that's it's definitely a guessing game you're not gonna be able to figure out what platform is gonna break before it does because at this point you have thousands and thousands of these apps and new platforms that are coming out so I think that the only way like use said to actually be seen and be heard is to just create great content and continue to create it there's always you and you can figure out the platforms it's not very hard to push like I just started with I don't know if you use buffer at all I just started with that a little bit which is really just an aggregator so they like pushes your content out into different sites to allow you to keep your audiences engaged and keep content live on each of them because sometimes if you have like a Facebook page and you haven't updated it in a year people are gonna follow you because you don't have stuff there but I don't want to get distracted by going on Facebook so it allows me to just update it there without worrying about those distractions but you're right the bottom line is if you're not creating great content then nobody's going to listen to what you're saying yeah I mean you know you said a great point too you know one there is you could be an early adopter and be first to market right and if you're gonna do that do it with all your might with all your time to be the best at what that is but then there's another there's another side of it which is focus on what you focus on right it's like I'm not gonna pretend to be someone that I'm not or pretend I'm gonna have skills in an area that I don't have skills in so create content if that's what you really want to do or if there's a message that you want to talk about talk about it but write it in a way that speaks to someone that you know is going to be affected by it you know and I think because of those two right now most people they're trying to find their voice there's so many platforms that they're trying to they feel like they're missing out at a different party right it's like you're at one party and they're like wait there's three other parties down a block should I go there and it's just like well if you're at three other parties how many people are you gonna really talk to that's gonna have a conversation that's really gonna resonate with them yeah you know so it's like I'm as well to stay at one party find three or four people that you're gonna really talk to and then guess what they're gonna become friends yeah exactly and yeah I think that's gonna be the easiest way to actually create content early on it's just think about one person reaching one person because there's gonna be a lot more who share similar views and beliefs and if you're just if you're trying to target 10,000 people or trying to get a huge audience it's gonna fall flat because you're gonna be going too broad your message isn't gonna be specific enough yeah I mean that's what I see now actually you know with social media you know there there was a time when everyone just wanted as many friends as possible on Facebook right everyone wanted as many followers as possible on Instagram now I feel like you know it's going back to to niches where people want specific things it's like you know going to a supermarket and you know you're just trying to buy bread you go there and you see a hundred different types of bread you know it's it gets overwhelming at times so I feel like you know at this time it's kind of like if you want something and you know where to get it if it's a organic bread you're gonna go to the organic store to get organic bread. Yeah actually and that reminds me of something I was slightly related which is the the evolution of bloggers where bloggers started out it was all very personal and like that was really the first social media was people having their own blogs and commenting and sharing each other's posts and you know doing cross posts on each other's blogs but everybody was really identified by their name and it was very personal and then as these blogs blogs started to blow up again bigger then they created companies and then they were seen more as this entity either life hacker or blogger whatever like they changed themselves from being personal but now we're seeing an evolution which is like you said more micro it's smaller and you're talking about they're going back to identifying themselves people because that's what people want now it's like we were not identifying with companies anymore we're identifying with individuals yeah for sure and even a lot of the brands now are trying to figure out you know who their audiences I mean unless you're you know a big company like Nike and the underarmers of the apples of the world you've already created a culture and a lifestyle that spans you know years whereas you know a lot of these smaller companies they know exactly who to target right away a lot of the bigger companies don't know who they're reaching out to anymore and that's why they're always tapping into smaller boutiques to figuring out you know who's in a no so you're you're pushing copies at the copy machine that ad agencies early on oh yeah how did you how did you kind of navigate that world because I know you you eventually worked on some really really cool and exciting projects so how did you work your way through that world yeah for sure I mean you know you you you scale as fast as you want to right it's like even for your own business you know you start to learn things even though you don't know how to do them just because you want to push your own company forward right you you start to to teach yourself so you know when I was making copies I knew that just because that was my role at the job that did not define me in terms of where I wanted to be in my career so even though I was pushing copies I was figuring out what am I who's as copy for what is this assignment and who's the project manager on that job and at that point once and I started to do that I started to get to know all the people I was making copies for on my team and in the most of them were the directors of the companies so I started a relationship with them once when I would understand the topic I would actually do research on the topic and provide not only the copy and sometimes I would give them my own market research report on what I found as the competitors or the industry leaders within that segment just slip it in there with them yeah for sure yeah for sure and I would not only give it to them but I would give it to the whole team if it made that sense for them and so I would just slip it on a door and I would always stay late at work because you know when you're an intern or you're an entry-level position I mean you can leave it five if you wanted to know what we miss you so what I did was I kind of utilized a time that I had to just do extra work that I thought was valuable even though it was not in my job description so slowly as you know as I was there and making a name for myself people started to realize like who is this Jerry Chu that I always who is this what is this and and from there I started to really develop real relationships that I still have friendships still to this day with the former CEOs and presidents of my first company so that was probably the most important thing that you did right was developing relationship oh yeah developing relationships and learning what they went through you know just like anything else every every person has their own challenges in a day and as I started developing relationships in various departments whether it was print production TV production creative development account management I started to realize and understand what they were going through and that for me was communication one-on-one and from there you realize every every person in every department has their own agenda has their own objective and has their own target and so just like anything else as you put in storyboards together you have to realize there's a beginning and middle in an end and once when that is kind of packaged together we have to figure out then step two which is how do you get that distributed to the right audience yeah it seems like it was really for you about adding value it's like you didn't go to these directors and say what can I get from you you went to them and you said I did some extra research and this is like as an intern as it's somebody who's making copies and you said this might help yeah yeah I had to stay proactive you know and I think that's the that's the mentality of you know anyone that I see now who wants to make it somewhere you know that's that's the passion queue if you really want to do something you've got to go the extra mile no one's going to ever you know give you a responsibility that they can't dream up for you because they're worried about their you know roles and responsibilities so if you want to learn something you've got to do the extra homework to figure out what it is to be proactive what it is that you don't know before you left the corporate 95 type world what was your role and what were some of the projects that you were working on at that time well I would say right before that one of my mentors and the person who really shaped my career and kind of honed it was a brand guru by the name of Peter R. Nell and he's the guy who ended up creating DKY for Donna Karen he recreated Pepsi logo he's done you know worked with architects and one of his mentors and my mentors now is Frank Gary working on architectural projects and so right before I left I was managing director of the innovation lab for him where it was executing everything that he dreamed up and he was a pure innovator even though he was in the advertising marketing business he always saw things that did not live on a 2D piece of paper he he saw things that lived in 3D so if it was going to make an impact for a brand to create a car he would make a car so we worked on an electric car and developed it from ground up for Chrysler when you wanted to develop experiences for hotels and hospitality you know we worked with the architects to develop what and you know the experience was to shape the audience that was going to go to a destination having a mentor is so important especially early on what were some of the biggest lessons that you learned having him as your mentor failure is okay you just have to you know you just have to picture yourself back up and figure out you know what's the next move to to advance yourself forward to evolve yourself forward because mistakes are going to happen creativity you know is quite subjective you know you can do all this research in this world but you're going to have a lot of like we started talking about earlier on this in this recording but you're going to have a lot of failures going to have a lot of painters out there you can have a lot of commentators but at the same time it's creative right it's either you like it or you don't like it I mean at the bare root of what that is I think at the end of the day you just have to figure out are you you know are you truthful to yourself to say that you put the best work forward that you really felt was going to attract the people you were trying to speak to because at the end of the day if I did my best and I put it forward out there whatever media or creative outlet was and it fell flat on its face I'll be the first to say I'm sorry I tried but it just you know it didn't it didn't resonate with you did you always have an itch to run your own business you said your your dad did was that something that you always wanted to do eventually and you just were waiting for the right time yeah I I've always wanted to do something on my own always I've always surrounded myself whether it was by chance or circumstances but you know my dad being the first person I saw always working beyond all hours it wasn't a nine to five scenario I had a lot of friends whose parents were also immigrants and had their own businesses and so when I you know stepped out of school to go into advertising I knew before I can kind of run before I walk I wanted to learn the foundations of the business and what every department did so I could get at least exposed to it I think the number one thing is that I know that I know nothing but if I can kind of understand what every department is going through I'll at least know what questions to ask to help us get to point beat and so once when I did that and that's why I say my my my last kind of boss and mentor was good because he was an innovator in the industry and so the things that he did wasn't traditional in the formats of what an advertising agency did there were other departments called PR or digital and he kind of just was a good connector in terms of aligning the right specialists to each area to execute what he wanted to get through and that is 101 entrepreneurship just figuring out I know I want to get there how do I get the people in the community around me to believe in what I'm trying to do so that we can rally around building that bridge to get there that's the hardest thing especially when you're not when you're offering people money yeah you have to figure out how people how people motivated and oftentimes it's not by money and how can you get them excited and to believe in your vision because it needs to even if you have an idea in your head it's nothing if you can't get it out there and get other people to believe in what you're doing yeah exactly and it comes down to you it comes down to the idea right the content whatever you're creating if you don't believe in it how do you expect the second person to believe in what you're doing so you started to think cloud it was this the first company that you started out of the corporate world I did I did I mean for me it was just the name right I didn't know what it was that I was creating I just knew that I thought a lot right I was just like I think a lot and and for me you know the the intersection point of the name was the cloud was for me about my community so we all kind of like anything else what you and I do is we talk a lot we share ideas we brainstorm and so for me it was kind of a you know that was the first thing that I kind of developed coming out is doing what I know how I'd been doing for the last you know I guess 13 years or something like that when I first came out and and creating a boutique company yeah I'm curious in terms of timeline when did you guys when did we start working together how long had you been doing running the thing cloud was that relatively new at the time it was very new yeah I mean I had thought of the name before I left before I left our nel group and when I came up with that it was probably around 2010 yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah because that's when I graduated and it was yeah I was living at home with my parents at the time and I think you got some somebody knows somebody in front of a friend you know said oh they're looking for a video intern or something like that yeah and that has happened many times where people have said looking for a video intern and I will respond I think some people might be like turn off by that and build a new intern I'm not going to even respond but I was like well you know I'm not an intern but I do this professionally so if you're interested in working together that would be great and then we just developed a working relationship eventually we did retainer for a little while but we worked on a lot of projects over that time yeah just out of you guys looking for an intern yep um what I so a lot of times people people always ask me how I get new clients and I think that's a hard thing for people to wrap their head around and for you guys it seems like in the very beginning you hustle quite a bit and you did a lot of cold calls and door to door kind of not still do and you still do and that to me seems like the hardest thing but it worked out quite well for you guys and tell me a little bit about those kind of early things and and a lot of times you guys were focusing on even like small businesses right yeah yeah so 90% of my clients right now are still cool calls 90% of my business right now is pure pure hustle on projects that I feel that I know I can make a difference in and so that's what I do I look at the industries that I'm really passionate about things that I know I can be interested in and really affect change and so what I do is I pick up the phone and I call them so it's not so they're cold in the sense that you don't know these people you're not connected but you're you're being very selective about the people that you do reach out to because if you just had a list of a hundred companies and start randomly calling you don't know if your values align with that company if and and your past work is always going to be the work that you get in the future so if you've worked with ten other non-profit companies that have a specific vision uh and that are trying to raise funding and you say well I did this on ten previous projects yeah it's going to help you with that next company that's along that same level but if you're pitching to a Pepsi or one of these other uh more commercial clients you're not going to be able to get them so like what's your process of finding those clients and do have a structure in terms of Mondays I'm going to do phone calls or Mondays I'm going to reach out via email or LinkedIn or do you kind of it's just free flowing well I used to when I first started I did that when I first started I had a more format of structure probably because of my routine of working from you know eight to eight or whatever it was and so at first I would have to dedicate just like different departments I had to separate my time and balance in terms of you know what do I do enduring these hours of the day and then what I did was I also aligned it with when I knew clients would be at their phone oh okay that's interesting yeah and I have time what are the best times do you see well it's like social well now it's kind of evolving again because of social media it's just like you know you know people are going to be on their you know Instagrams from when they wake up to launch and you're not doing call calls as a phone call as we're talking about like emails linked in whatever I use phone calls I use emails I use whatever means are necessary I think what what I do is once when I realize what industry I want to kind of tap into where I can affect change I actually always have ideas ready ready for the people that I'm going to reach out to you and I think that takes a lot of work it does but that's the way you get paid for as well yeah for sure I mean that's you know the disadvantage I think a lot of people you know are probably you know won't value or won't do what I'm doing but at the end of the day I mean my mind is filled with so many creative ideas that if you're going to steal it I have another idea in the back pocket I feel the same way because that's the value is that you can create more ideas if the only thing that these people can do are steal them they're not going to get very far when a client asks them specifically hey can you come up with this you know a specific idea for our campaign it's going to be much more difficult I mean you know even when I was working for corporate and it was companies like Pepsi and so forth you know I mean not them specifically but but in general all these major major clients before would you know you sit in a boardroom and you have tons of ideas and next you know it's their name attached to it happens a lot happens a lot happens everywhere and I think that in this world there's no idea that's your own anyway so if you're going to take it and going back to earlier on conversation 80% of it is execution so if you're going to take it you're still not you still won't execute at the way that I had seen it in my head the way that I know it would have impacted it and a more authentic way to your audience that's the best way to go about it because you can just get so upset about everything and anytime somebody crosses you or steals an idea from you it can be a sign that the world's out to get you but the that mentality in that mindset I think is so important just be like whatever like on to the next one I got more ideas where that came from for sure and you know again I mean I think our whole premise of the conversation is really about that's you know those are either haters or people who don't you know understand what you do but they take it I look at it as you know what the idea was good enough that you wanted it yeah yeah exactly one of the the best things that I learned from was this idea and strategy by remeberate say that he calls it the briefcase technique where if you go to a meeting with somebody so if you get to that point where you're actually going to sit down meeting they're like we want to hear more about your company tell you a little bit about what we need say from out of a video campaign that we're looking to produce that's a huge opportunity to be able to sit down in person and you have to know that they're not going to be the only one they're not talking to just you if they're bringing you in to have a conversation they're likely speaking with at least three to five other vendors and they're figuring out prices they're figuring out you know what's going to separate and make this person different why do you want to work with this person part of it's going to be to your personality and like if you can be great and your good conversation list it's going to help you because they're going to but well this is a person I could see myself working with the other thing is how do you separate yourself and remeberate advice is go so you have a bag or a briefcase have ideas that you write out and you print and whether it's like so I've got the I've got an idea for like strategy in terms of future videos that we can do after we do this series we could do Bob Bob Bob or here's three like I did a little bit of research on your demographic and where I see going but then you'd be like oh first of all ask him hey do you mind if I pitch you guys and show you guys a couple ideas I was just you know thinking a little bit and develop a couple concepts of course they're going to say yes but you get the permission first to show the ideas then you go to your briefcase you take out these this piece of paper and then you hand it to them and in a way it's almost like maybe biologically wired that you are now getting and receiving a gift from this person and they're providing their ideas for free and then I guarantee the other three to five people that they're talking to will not be doing that and I've done that on a few meetings I often don't a lot of times I don't have in-person meetings like that but that reminded me of what you just said where like you'll come with ideas prepared and that fact alone is going to separate yourself from 90% of the other competitors for sure and that's the same philosophy that I've been living with when I saw my career right being proactive you know doing the extra work you know because at the end of the day most people don't want to do the extra work because it takes time it takes time and a lot of effort what were some of the biggest challenges early on as you developed building up a client base as you developing a business and did you foresee those challenges like it seems like it would be it's very difficult to go from being in a agency to start in your own yeah I'd say the number one challenge you know there hasn't been anything that has kind of sideline me but the the major challenge that I see is still the number one you know fixture is still sales right so it's like still getting the clients or still you know hustling to get the job I think at the end of the day it's still it's still work I mean even when I developed my product line you know the brand noisy you know it wasn't about developing the brand because I had already had that in my head of what I was going to design develop which were you know a lifestyle brand targeting active use to stay healthy and wellness through the products of Bluetooth before it became before it came out with the earpods and your pods yeah exactly and blew us away this year like a year ago yeah yeah three years ago you know thankfully we were first on the scene but at the end of the day it's all about scale you know and I'm happy with what we did but but at the end of the day it's about trying to figure out and hone in on what it is you trying to do yeah I think you're always going to face challenges of acquiring new clients of and like you said you're not always going to love every aspect of running a business for sure and there are kind of flows where it's like you you're you're really excited about the work you're doing and then you can hit a rut where like this is this sucks or this is like work you still have to put in the time yeah yeah actually you just said it you know because of sales that takes up a lot of time versus you know and it takes away from the creativity because what you're doing is you're trying to figure out you know I have this great idea I want I know that it'll benefit you called excline and then you constantly doing that because a lot of the time it takes a while for someone to really understand that you're not trying to sell me something you really trying to help me yeah that's the hardest thing is to be able to and it's really more of a framing how do you frame that conversation how do you frame that relationship that it's not I need money I think a lot of times that's it's very subtle and it's under it flies under the radar and if you are legitimately filled up with work and you don't necessarily need this client you don't need every single project that you're pitching I think you're going to give that off in the way that you communicate with them you probably can you can fake it I'm sure it's like if you're just getting started out you need to have that mentality you can't seem desperate or else nobody's going to want to work with you because like if you're desperate then you know it doesn't really reflect highly on the quality and caliber of the skills that you're providing yeah and that's anybody right that's just call it a friendship yeah you can't be over eager in terms of you know what you're trying to do people will see through that yeah I think that it's either you know all you can do is give it and if they either accept to choose to take it is another is another scenario but you can't force feed anyone did you have any early wins or turning points where you you realize oh yeah I can actually do this this is actually no you're still working no yeah no because you know at the end of the day it's about your confidence you know it's like what do you see as a success you know and for me I still don't like to call myself an entrepreneur I just see myself constantly working and figuring out what it is that I can change or affect change or help raise funds for for people that I know that need it and that's all that I can do you know because at the end of the day it's like happiness overrides anything else we can always go back to the corporate world and have something that's you know an 8 to 8 or 9 to 5 or whatever you want to call it but if that doesn't make you happy you know that that's not gonna make you happy yeah I think there's gotta be a balance of you know being creative being able to affect change and then you know being able to live a life with with a balance that you know that you can go to bed at night knowing that you've changed something how do you define success now and I know for me personally my idea of success has changed drastically over the past five years even I had a certain mindset coming out of high school in the college where success meant like the big house car money and the status and everything that would prove to everybody else in myself that I was successful but it certainly changed quite a bit did you have similar ideas of what success was when you were just getting started out in the corporate world and then what's your idea of success now oh yeah for sure I mean you know when I was in college they were probably more those there was definitely a deeper culture of what advertising and media companies were when I in the 90s it was the you know it's the dawn draper's of the world flash dash you know magazine parties celebrities all of that stuff go on a games and you know when I came out of course just like anything else to be in front or behind a camera was a good cool industry to be in I knew that I was you know talked about amongst my friends as the guy who didn't go to work he had fun yeah you know and I think you know during that ride of working in traditional advertising agencies I think at the time I think success was exactly what you had mentioned it was about having the stuff I think you know having done all of that at such a high level especially with traveling the world working with the icons that I've read about I realized that through their eyes and being and and and and and through all of what some of the the wisdoms that they had told me it's never about any of that stuff I realized that they always had the same core support system of their family and friends around them wherever they travel the world even though they were making an impact of getting the flash and the dash and the stuff at the end of the day none of that stuff matter it was who was in an inter circle that really kind of helped shape them and kind of gave them the right foundation to to feel confident about themselves that they did something and so for me success now is exactly that it's about the quality of life it's about you know quality of the people that have around me who's my who's in my corner to help kind of give me the empowering words that says you can do it you know because I believe it but it's always nice to you know to have someone that you know who also sees a reflection of who you are and says you know what yeah man you got this yeah I think it just as running a business you have these Eddon wings of a feeling great and not feeling great I think you're always going to face a little bit of doubt here and but to have family and friends who are close by who are always rooting you on and always supporting you like that's more important I think than anything because it's like as long as you have this small community of people that are rooting you on it inspires you and I think if you don't have a community of people because there's certainly I'm sure people who don't have a supportive group of family and friends you can find it there there are people out there who are feeling in an similar position to you you just need to find your community yeah exactly and that takes time right that takes a lot of time and effort to to to meet those people yeah and again I think that are more more opportunities now where there are meetups there you know there are events that you can kind of talk to you it's like a therapeutic club yeah yeah what we go through because no one no one really understands like I have my core group of entrepreneurs as well that I've kind of met through the the channels they're all in various industries and you know I kind of see what they've what their struggles are like and we always have bad days our days are not traditional to what someone else goes through when they're given day like you and I you know we probably have 90% of our day filled with doubt we're picking up the phone call or you you create an edit and you're like you know at the end of the day you're like I spent the whole day working on this edit this is crap yeah I start again you know tomorrow or whatever and that's that's another form of doubt and then even now I've been releasing a lot of content I put out like two to three videos every week and then it's funny but you do get better at it the more and more you do it the more and more you put stuff out there the more and more you pick up the phone for a cold call you see these people outside of Whole Foods who are always like counting you so like get them to sign their form or their waivers and they just get rejected time after time I find them to be completely annoying because my work my office is connected to Whole Foods so every day I walk by and then I'm like nope nope nope nope but you see like they're just resilient they keep going and I think that in a lot of ways I don't think you should be annoying and I just I just despise that profession of kind of standing outside and trying to get people to sign up for your your thing I think there's better ways to do it but the resilience to be able to keep going and every failure you get right there every shed of doubt you have it's just going to evaporate as you keep pushing yourself forward and improving oh yeah totally right they they have a positive outlook they don't care what your thoughts are I mean even right now you're like you know we all have our two cents about those those individuals it's it what's going to spam of the real life world right like you're just spamming in box you're spamming actually yeah but you know what they they probably get 10 signatures and they're happy with that that's what they need yeah they have no idea they can get that that's it what are you most excited about right now with the the project that you're working on and looking forward the projects that I'm working on now that probably have the most meaning to me is working on that nonprofit beauty for freedom yeah it's it's an organization non-profit organization right now that is bringing awareness and funds and workshops rooted in fashion art and photography to help save human trafficking huge huge you know endeavor right now just in terms of that alone they're like about 27 million kids to adults that are trafficked globally how do we prevent that is there like I guess what are you guys doing this foundation that helps to lower that impact well there's two there's two modes it's a it's a typical thing where this organization actually empowers individuals on a local level to bring awareness raised funds donate artwork and a lot of these ambassadors or volunteers are in the industries of art fashion photography and what we do is we try to talk about it we try to raise funds about it and then we find local nonprofits on the ground whether it's in Cambodia whether it's in India or Africa and we go over there and we actually teach the some of the survivors exactly you know the meaning to life because a lot of these kids in children and adults you know they've kind of been conditioned where they don't see any value to what that is and so through the creative arts and it's kind of a therapeutic scenario here where they're workshops curriculum that are teaching them that they are meaningful yeah and so really where your skills come in handy is to help to promote and get the word out about this organization to get people to sign up to donate and I imagine a lot of where your value comes in is that you've created an amazing network of creatives of artists of freelancers who are able to help and contribute is that right and yeah yeah exactly I'm an ambassador so for me I'm always talking about it and I'm always trying to raise awareness for it and do whatever I can to support it you know but the team itself and the founder Monica Watkins is you know really you know leading the charge because the community itself is more like a family and everyone who's involved with it has an attachment to really try to help yeah that's great uh do you want to do some rapid fire questions depends what it is all right it's rapid questions it's not rapid answers so you don't have you know no pressure here to finish it in one sound good um all right so looking back on both your career and the big agency world as well as the small agency startup world do you can you identify one thing is your biggest screw up or mistake or failure that you just can't shake even when you look back on it you cringe and in my first episode of the ground up show I talked about mine which is like a shot of reality show and I forgot to hit record when I needed to and I didn't I didn't tell them and I just the footage never existed um yeah so do you have something that comes to mind for you uh it could be specific or it could be just uh you know things didn't work out to tell you the truth I actually don't have one in mind because I'm sure there are so many yeah I mean you know just to put in perspective I've worked in every industry from automobiles to home remodeling and development of products to working on hotels and hospitality there my background isn't none of those industries you know and I had to work with architects and speak their language and engineers and speak their language so for me I feel like it was always a screw up and I'm sure if you ask any of them the questions I be like who is that numb nut yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I feel the same way but you're right it's and I think it's like you don't frame them as failures that's just part of life it's like you you make these little mess ups and mistakes and you ask the wrong question or um you maybe send the wrong deliverable but at the end of the day um that's learning it's not those aren't failures yeah exact I mean and that's why it's like for me I can't I think I box it away in an area where it's like here is a general sense because I think for me every single scenario for me was like what am I doing I still do that to this day man I still like screw up all the time but that's like the fun stuff because it's getting better you know and it's it's every time you put yourself in a situation where even if it's just a subtle failure subtle screw up you're gonna be more prepared for the next time you face it because if you don't put yourself out there you're never gonna get better no what drives you I would say it's it's myself I'm probably hardest on myself so for me it's a daily a daily activity of what drives me I look at the beginning of the day as a starting point and then if I don't kind of achieve what I see is successful as the end of the day I kind of have to put myself part of the next day take it day by day if I do yeah I feel the same way let's say someone's stuck right now they're just getting started out either right out of college or they're trying to pivot like you did from a big agency to starting your own thing what advice would you give them to do today this very moment right after they listen to this podcast to push them in the right direction I would say find people to speak with that are in your industry that you're trying to get started in if you're having a rut I would personally reach out to former mentors reach out to colleagues and I would ask questions like what is what is the issue that you're having with that is the block that's in front of you there are always more than one solution to a problem and the hardest thing isn't about identifying the solution but the hardest thing is trying to figure out what questions that ask that you're not sure and that's why you're having the roadblock where do you think you have the most room for improvement everything yeah I have I need one well I mean I'd say right now like even though I'm happy and all of that stuff I still do have my own goals of where I want you know my my company to be or how I can help clients further and and for me it's about really improving on everything whether it's you know creative or budget or execution is it do you have an end goal where you'll say this is the point I'm striving for or is it is it that growth and that continual execution that's really what drives you yeah I think it's about scale I think at the end of the day it's about making sure that you're really satisfying all of the check you know the boxes that you have to check whether it's even the the brain storming sessions that you have with collective creatives you know being able to truly listen because like even you know anyone like for us even if we're going through a brain storming session and we're sharing ideas you're still probably speaking more about your own ideas and trying to articulate your thought visually versus listening to what the other person's ideas are and so for me it's always about again in this an session like that it's about listening more but I need more improvement in listening you can always you can always you're right and so it's always about that and I try to be more patient with clients as well sometimes I mean at the end of the day they're the experts of their own business and so then I try to take what I learn from every single client to every single experience and I try to apply that going forward I might not do the best and I might still follow my old habits but at the end of the day it's it's just knowing that I can identify that that's one of you know the things I need to improve on and it's just kind of moving it forward so I think it was budget right so it's it's all across the board yeah for me what tool or skillset have you utilized in a way that you think others haven't I would say because of my experience of of working in various industries I have applied my knowledge of all those industries in a way where you don't have to come up with the best solution you just have to figure out what solution is right and apply it in a different way so I kind of apply that knowledge in my skillset going forward which I don't think that people yeah that's a great point because like a lot of times it's always the best what's the best possible like ideal we could think about this moment but it's not always about the best sometimes it's about the most efficient or the quickest or there's there's a lot of other ways and there's also some such thing is good enough right you know what I mean and also budget and you can't continue to keep pounding away putting out thousands of ideas eventually you've got to pick one that's going to work well and then just execute it because like you said it's not about the idea as much as it about can you execute it can you will this reach people right so how should people connect with you online where do we send them uh to the stitch effect that's the name of uh my creative agency gotcha um so
