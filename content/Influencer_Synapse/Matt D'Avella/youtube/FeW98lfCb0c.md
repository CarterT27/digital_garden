Alexis Wilkinson has written for HBO’s VEEP & FOX’s Brooklyn Nine-Nine. She initially pursued a degree as a biomedical engineer, but made a 180 to become a comedy writer. And the transition paid off pretty quickly.

In her junior year of college she was elected as the president of the Harvard Lampoon, a historic magazine with a 140 year history. We discuss PC culture, dick jokes, having a fallback plan & the art of bullshitting.

listening to the ground up show a podcast that inspires creatives to make meaningful content and pursue their passions my name is Matt the Evela and I'm a filmmaker best known for the Netflix documentary minimalism and I'm sitting down with creators to talk about their process the lessons they've learned and how to make an impact we just got this table in yesterday it's beautiful thank you I love it yeah we just like when it says I'm a catalog and said we'll just have everything just get a west out and look at you coming up in the world not even like yeah yeah real marble yeah don't spill your coffee I keep it right yeah my piece of shit Ikea bullshit I just we couldn't earn her I just upgraded from the flurgan burger burger burger that's what I had before yeah I like this so cuz like you know what it's the round table it's got some half to it and half to means wealth you know it actually does yeah it's like the you know the slaves that had to bring this up here yeah they did not enjoy it oh my god they like it was these two huge hoping guys and I was they were just sweating and I was like oh my god right and that's that's a new assistant they're like yes bring me my taste that's when I knew I made it yeah that's when I knew it yeah yeah that'll do yeah but don't scratch me gone yeah it wasn't great it wasn't a good look but again like it's I used to have this Ikea table here and it was all set up and I had like the wiring I'd basically left this entire set up all the time it was in my in our dining room which is like in a small apartment right and Natalie wasn't a big fan of that she wasn't yeah it'd be hard to eat and you I'd be afraid of like knocking one of these I assume expensive items off until we didn't eat here we would just eat on the ground over there like in front of the board in front of that lovely gourds yeah in front of our board this one why you summon the pumpkin to ghosts I'm never gonna have any idea what that means all right let's start the gourd display that's going off the rails it's going off the rails like my podcast all right so let's just start the show if we didn't already so Alexis thank you for being here you're welcome thanks for inviting me you sound very excited I'm suspicious you suspicious of what's the come next yeah yeah you already you know I'm not I'm just a very suspicious price and generally so yeah I'm still feeling it out feeling it out to see in the top frontions are gonna come yeah exactly what hard hitting things yeah what skeleton I dug deep I'm sure you did yeah not my mom I did you know that was an option what's not no so once I'm the Chicago Tribune called my mom without talking to me and she gave them like the craziest quote I can't remember what you said you didn't get the prep your mom I don't say something crazy yeah something crazy I can't remember what it was but I got really mad and I called them because I I talked to them afterwards and then I found out when the article came out that they had talked to my mom and I said don't talk to my mom you don't get to call my mom without talking to me yeah that's like a no-no in the journalistic community so I mean right because it's my mom my mom's crazy you know what she's gonna say and she just you just call her I've been saying hey I'm so-and-so we just talked to me about your daughter she would be like yeah what's wrong with a bitch you know like you can't even put that in your man you know you got to give me a time to tolerate me hey mom you know don't be drunk you need to be that next to her like squeezing her like you know we just got started I know this is already crashed and burned okay this is like my favorite podcast so far already I sometimes think when I'm working on the podcast and when we're actually having a talk I'm like all right like that came across like I sounded stupid on that so I'm gonna help rephrase that right now so I can edit it out but we're talking so fast okay then I might slow it down yeah it's gonna be weird it's gonna be like we're gonna be rapidly talking in all of a sudden it just like cuts to us being common collected well I mean you can start over right I was actually just messing I actually like it I like it okay okay all right yeah yeah that's right that's weird I didn't think it was it's like halfway through the sentence and I was like you know you're like happy through sentence you're like is that I have to have nowhere else to work yes no there's no way to like add a preposition on the end yeah my dad's like that he's got no filter at all so he'll be halfway through sentence and then he'll just stop and then he will finish it because he's like it's better to not finish right I think I think you're right you know what I've actually learned that I'm gonna try to do a little bit more than I'm gonna try to do it now is like taking more pauses or just length here pauses be true like at the end of one thought in the beginning of another instead of filling it with like and you know and you know people never think you're stupid if like but if you ask me a question and I take a pregnant paus and then I answer with some beautiful and say it full like poet laureate shit you're just gonna think oh my god what a genius you're not gonna think oh she took three seconds to answer my question yeah so the first time that I did one of these podcasts and I watched the video back I was really anxious to watch it because what's going on in my head isn't actually what's happening in person because like in my head I'm thinking like oh my god this is I'm fucking this whole thing up everything is going wrong I'm thinking all right what should I say next what should I ask next uh just trying to keep up with the conversation and then I watch it back and I was like oh like I just wasn't saying anything I was just smiling and nodding like nobody knows that you're losing it right yeah yeah inside it my head is just a bunch of people it's what's that they's that gift for this like file cabinets on fire and people just running around yeah sponge Bob yeah yeah like that yeah yeah just chaos this bunch Bob episode and not one of the better ones either yeah yeah let's uh for people who don't know who you are and the work that you do let's give them a little bit of background sure my name is Alexis I'm a Libra I'm from Wisconsin I was really Milwaukee area I write and direct comedy I've worked for VP which are on HBO I've worked for Brooklyn 99 Sean Fox I wrote and directed sketch for funny or die uh I perform sporadically and I come on podcast sometimes and sweat and a lot it's sweat sweat is a big part of it but if you're not sweating you're not working right it's what I always say yeah yeah um you've been doing this for a little while it wasn't always what you had thought you were gonna get into from the beginning is that right of my life yeah from when you were born it's like you're like I'm gonna be a comedy yeah I thought it was gonna be an astronaut princess um princess of the moon it's like so happened right it's so happened there's no princess of the moon yet there is none right I even know that was the position is open yeah and I am sweating my way there yeah yeah right for your sweat alone I'm gonna get there um I think I think it's so weird I know some people who say oh when I was seven I knew I wanted to write comedy or do comedy I think that's crazy you must have been of some sort of weird social path like you didn't want to I knew one you didn't want to do something practical one how rich were you were you like mom dad I must dance you know or whatever I must do comedy I'm like I wanted to make money yeah I was like I don't like not having a lot of money I want more money so whatever you know I watched um the Cosby show I was not saying alright people Cosby might as well alright Pete but um I just wanted to be clear-hooksable I want to be a lawyer um and my mom wanted a doctor in a lawyer and she almost got it my sister is in med school right now and um I write penis jokes for a living so yeah so that's a big change you know what your mom thought you were gonna get into yeah I'm proud of you oh no she loves it so very much she does does she get upset at the dick jokes so can you just clean it up like no actually that's my sister it's so funny I'll send her I I do it last now because I realized it's exploitative but I used to send her everything that I write and erote and um sometimes she would see something and say you know oh Kant Alexis do we really need to use the word Kant right there like is that really next necessary just just think about it you just just is it really necessary and I'd say fuck yeah um and so she was he was the one who it's just saying oh it's a little too blue for me Alexis I just don't know yeah but he's that she's right I could be worse though that could be a worse reaction yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah because that's one of those words that is visceral for a lot of people and it is you just own it the way that you walked into it and you called me a Kant earlier uh nobody needs to know that what that was between you and me that was a special moment yeah before we started the show but I don't like everybody can pull that off you kids is walking here I do that way you did I thought I walked in and said hey Kant I didn't say that that's not what I said you said that what's up I do I do group my friends with what's up dickheads yeah I do do that like I was just said to me the other night I walked into the table two people said what's up dickheads yeah that's that's good it's a during to I mean if you like it just shows comfort with other people maybe I'm looking to find it maybe maybe you're right I think it's I think you're right because I don't do it with people I don't feel comfortable around yeah dickhead is one of my favorite terms of in in deer men you could probably tell when somebody's not going to get it and somebody's not going to be cool with right dickhead or they don't have a sense of humor right which they probably deserve to be called a dickhead right I mean I yeah and I and I can totally understand some people I I feel like I can read my audience pretty well I didn't think you were going to say get out podcast over and get this get this Negroes out here I'll be in my virtual yeah it didn't happen and we just started the best podcast ever made we're doing good so far I dropped the word Negroes yeah you do you did I'm killing it I'm hitting all my mind my boy yeah you got your talking buddy before you started hey I got it yeah you did you you're doing good this is going to be hard this is going to be hard because I it's like all over the place okay and it's it's about your story you got to rain it in man I mean I'm just I'm going to Charlie Rose I got to get Charlie Rose on you we're um Diane Sawyer Diane Sawyer yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah in there what do you want to know what's where did it all start where did y'all start I feel now I definitely have to like look whistful y'all I feel where did it begin where does it end isn't that the real question um I would say okay comedy writing for me started I didn't really start writing comedy in any ways even to send my seriously until high school and that was um because I was a just a math and science kid I did science fair um and just sort of you know AP cow again I was really kind of a big honor student really type A taking billion AP courses and they wanted to come myself and so that was fun and I I don't know I didn't really see it as like a viable hobby in a real way just sort of something I did for fun I always kind of when I was younger I would make a little songs to remember sort of math back so like if I was studying for a test I always would make a funny song to the team like if I only had a brain for algebra I remember that or geometry it was a geometry song I remember um and I was really bad at geometry and so I thought that was funny but and I journaled and stuff but what kid doesn't journal if you don't journal I do are you even what kind of little kid are you write something okay be literate um but it's it wasn't anything serious until high school and um and high school myself and a really different of mine started a satirical news letter called amateur night and uh we were the nights that was our mascot at our school girl nights uh and so it's a very clever fun yeah oh hi bro hi bro and uh so we started that and it still exists to this day I found out and we recently wrote um for it the the new editor contacted us and asked if we would write a sort of a letter from the old editors and basically we just with the little conceivies of things was kind of why does this still exist why are you still doing this like you know the onion is there right like like we did it because we were stupid we you guys like keep doing it and we don't know why it's destroyed their hopes and dreams like we're like this is dumb guys like we did it we were dumb you're dumb yeah yeah you don't really have dumb this is yeah you don't even know and the onions went around for a year now the we we started it because the onion was kind of um people don't know that though it was like a bunch of you W. Madison grass started the onion and I remember getting hard copies of it in like Kudoba next to the real news and so it was kind of a take off of that but the onions have been around for years now guys and like you don't need to do this professionals are doing right there's like a real place for this you know several real places for this you don't have to do it here but they continue for reasons unknowable right because they're a little idiots that's why they don't get it you're stupid yeah you're just what's 17 16 oh god yeah just jump off a cliff forget it it doesn't get better yeah it's uh it's so hard though because at that age you know like are you gonna make anything like worth nothing no you're not gonna make anything good it's not like you know back with like Newton was like doing his thing like he made up geometry but he's like one in a million right most people are just like yeah you're not gonna nothing but you have to do it you gotta make stuff right so yeah I take that back don't jump off a cliff yeah make some stuff that's the actual advice that I give and I actually I try to be sort of uh I'm really I keep really poking your marble table and I know what's making you nervous yeah I'm her poor fingers are on my table don't touch peasants yeah I'm just really poking the shit out of it because I'm impressed but I weren't talking about you gotta go on do stuff encourage people yeah encouraging people do stuff I try to be a mentor figure I did young storytellers which is a great program um last year um and you help third graders write us like a screenplay and then real actors go and perform it it's really really fun that sounds hilarious and my kids um screenplay was called Randy Savage's Crazy Dream and I can only describe it as a mix between chicken run and inception wow and it's this is amazing as you think yeah and one of my friends said oh you know do you just write it for them and like you think I wrote Randy Savage's Crazy Dream like I know I'm a hack but come on now let's give me a little credit yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah it was sort of word scrumble thing got it right uh it's like some generator right i just planned uh on the board we've got Randy Savage and crazy dream alright get you know it's not an improv show yeah but uh so you you're doing this in high school and then you know you're starting to prepare for where you want to go to college what did you have in mind at that point did you have big hopes and dreams I applied to 18 schools I just wanted to go somewhere and go somewhere on the cheap and go somewhere where I felt like I could kind of figure out exactly what it was I wanted to do because I applied to schools as biomedical engineering um you can you imagine we being an engineer what what what what what what what what's the who interests me to engineer something right fix their broken arm with some sort of biomedical no way I'm like you can't you look around and call people come when you're I'm going to the this surgical office what's up dickheads let's do this thing yeah let's make some biotic legs yeah stem cells yeah she was the best in the world yeah there is nobody better so research was revolution yeah still called everyone in the room a dickhead no that's so good um no I think I would have choned it down I didn't get this way until recently mostly because of functional alcoholism but um yeah this was full of mud yeah that's why you brought your own yeah you didn't see what I've written here yeah the bathroom is true it's true that's why you're wearing the bathroom not not sure what you come out no I probably look like I'm on Jack I'm promise I'm not on Jack's mom I'm promise yeah I'm just sweaty it's hot it's kind of hot yeah it's a little hot like they are going yeah um but so I applied as biomedical engineering and I was sort of just trying to figure out what I wanted to do and then I kind of immediately realized after I got into school um just like on the MIT and that kind of became the choice was going to go to MIT or Harvard and I visited MIT and I really I liked MIT a whole lot and I kind of was in love with Cambridge just the whole idea of it in the place and having a little school so close together which I think is really cool but I kind of realized I don't want to be an engineer and if I don't want to be an engineer and I go to MIT that's stupid it's the only reason I should go if I really if I want to be an engineer and I don't go to MIT that's really stupid so it was kind of just like to be or not to be an engineer that was kind of a big first big fork in the road that's a big decision I make 18 years old right no one should have to do that but um I think I'm so you want me to fall back which was hard but that's a big decision that's the next four years rest of your life yeah and I I don't know I get very anxious I'm a Libra I'm as I didn't mention that and so I'm very indecisive that's I just like using that whenever I make a really bad decision or can't decide I think I'm like I'm a Libra so you can't stop to take me yeah if you didn't hear like my moon is in the 7th house or whatever yeah the mercury is in retrograde so let's make everybody embrace like I'm sweating because of that so like just back up yeah that's a good thing to have in the back of your back pocket right some like terro card yeah yeah I'm sorry do you see this do you see this that's why this is happening yeah my spirit animal is a fog right and I just all dead fox so you like this is actually discrimination what you're doing right now just judging me about like my actions and the words that I say yeah who how dare you how dare you who are you right how do you like think about the words I say and what they mean and what order I put them in yeah and what I do what crazy inside life is inside um but yeah so I guess I decided not to be an engineer and then I got to Harvard and I was said okay well if I'm not gonna be an engineer what I'm gonna do and um I picked economics because I had taken economics in high school and really really enjoyed it um and I done something called the fed challenge which is the nerdyest thing now I realize it it's you pretend to be the fed board like federal treasury board the hell and you debate as kids do these things right just like a normal teenage thing to do right put on a little power suit and pretend to be the head of the fed like model you in is one brand like like fed challenges a whole another level of you know future Bernie made off bullshit yeah you were going straight to the top like big ambitions no I wanted I wanted to be out of the fed man I was like tax policy man tax breaks let's do it get it get it get it um and I just wanted to make money yeah and so I and I really liked also psychology so I ended up doing economics with basically a minor in psychology so behavioral economics decision science works in the Harvard decision science lab for a while that was super dope and um yeah so I was doing all that and then my freshman year so I'm I switched economics and so I'm saying okay let me just what so I'm gonna study economics alright what else am I gonna do am I gonna get a Spanish citation or something study abroad and my gonna play a sport um not good at that um I was Wisconsin okay you know so like Harvard terrible yeah yeah yeah yeah I was okay I was gonna join the road team no no I don't remember not knowing what crew was I remember getting the canvas to be a crew yeah like what a crew what I would what kind of crew what are they doing they're like in the boat yeah what the way I'm like yeah I totally picture you know nice in the 1800s you know racing tongs and that's exactly what they wear they just like you know big like 1800s swim trucks and they might have like be curly yeah yeah yeah um they take it seriously it's like it is and they look damn good I'm telling that yeah I haven't seen a lot many a crush on a on a roger yeah I was like you the coxon that's cool anyways I'm guessing that's somebody on the boat okay okay I just finish it yeah I'm a lady yeah and I expect to be treated as such okay all right all right my project I stepped that alone yeah I wait over the line buddy okay watch yourself got it good um let's see well I'm curious why why you were drawn to make a lot of money like it seems obvious I think that's like a lot of people's ambitions when they're young yes I guess if for people that that don't have a lot of money girl too yeah I mean we were we were okay but I think also my father passed away when I was younger and I think I've acutely felt that like loss of income like you know like income being halved like very acutely and I don't know I don't know why um because I'm sure you know again I don't know the details of how rough that transition was or not but I just remember being like man things were so much better before I look at every way obviously and and I guess in my mind like well I can't you know zombie him and bring him back from the dead but I can make money you know and that might help fix things and take some stress off my mom and take some stress off me and yeah because not having money isn't the way to get happiness you know the way to become content my mom always said money doesn't buy happiness but poverty doesn't buy anything kind of you I said having money is not everything not having it is my mom and Kanye just like synergies you know freaking pod that's a I mean that's a it's a great point like you you you have to have something you need but that that's a good for your mental health it's so stressful not knowing if your lights are gonna be on or if you break a leg or you're gonna have to go begging on the street or if you're gonna have to prostitute yourself next month because you don't have any money for books you know it's just it's it's a constant stresser and it's bad for your health it makes you it's physical there studies it show it physically makes you sick and and you're the lead and the person who can at least afford to get sick yeah so it's the irony of our 90s and it adds more stress right that's more stress you know it's just calm pounds it is a first world problem but it's a problem nonetheless the fact that once you just focus on the money and you're just focusing on accumulating money yeah then you tend to go astray a little bit right and I think I realized that especially studying economics where I know a lot of people now who you know worked for Goldman and Deutsche Bank and and all the stuff and they're miserable and they hate their lives a lot and they don't they have all the money they don't have any time to spend it and when they do it's it's an extravagant way but they don't I don't seem really happy I know some people are really happy doing it but I knew I wouldn't be happy doing that even if I was making a lot of money so it was kind of the next kind of big fork was okay if I'm not going to be an eye banker okay and I still want to make a lot of money and I've got this economics degree what am I going to do and how how can I do this you know is there any way to reconcile these things and for a while didn't seem like there was and I was kind of especially my senior you're kind of freaking out just being like there's no way I can put these things together should I go to grad school I guess that's what people do right I go to grad school you know just freaking out I should have took him out so I had you know the classic you know classic senior scramble yeah so to speak and also I was I was you know terms swugg I know I don't a senior washed up girl no I didn't do anything really to me so whatever reasons you weren't a swugg now yes swuggs navy yeah I was I was swuggin it pretty hard I was just you know some old mistress of the lampoon like walking about and we like back in my day there's a never would have happened yeah someone bring me a martini you know I just just was you know I was swugged out swugged out so hard that's that's gonna age me so much you were gonna like you know nobody says that I don't know anything my cousin it was in college like I can't believe he said it's like what are you like 30 yeah almost yes yes you little condom there it is again it's great check but yeah so I mean I joined Lampoon when I was a freshman I think that was kind of the big turning point physically at least gave me the option to go kind of into comedy directly I have college which is how I got here and I just I I joined Lampoon because I was not good at sports and I even though I was captain of the debate team at Wisconsin I knew I wouldn't even make the debate team at Harvard I didn't even try wasn't I was no way no way not good enough again we were stay champs and Wisconsin not even good enough to like go to strides yeah it's not or maybe maybe I was and I just had no confidence but because of amateur night and doing that little bit of writing that I did in high school I guess I thought well and I'd wanted to award I went um uh scholastic humor writing award like best in the Midwest humor writing like one little metal and everything was invited to vending dc but they didn't pay for me to go so I didn't go it's cool dummy yeah if they don't pay right I don't get out of bed yeah honey honey even at the age I'm like no no no no no video conference no no um so I uh just went to uh Lampoon uh let's say Lampoon auditions like we're singing a dance oh no I just yeah I just decided so Lampoon uh I actually had never heard of it um but it's a big deal I looked it up pretty long with old age yeah it's a go over 120 years old it's 140 years old I just round it because I'm not gonna laugh 18 70 yeah come on in the grand scheme that's 20 years to think deal right this podcast has been offered so much that age that's like yeah it's like you're a whole life this is round down by an existence yeah it didn't even happen yeah a blip a whole generation it's really long and then a lot a lot long history but also like a lot of amazing uh comedians and writers and uh that have gone through there yeah it's uh a pretty big deal to be a part of it like it's not it's pretty selective I'm sure as well yeah yeah it's a tough um it's a tough uh comp that's what you call that it's depending every so clubs at Harvard have a comp and depending on it's the joke is whatever depending on the club it's either competition or competency um so you comp to get on or whatever um and it's a tough one it's a tough one you have to do a lot of writing but it makes you good it makes you sharp and I think that's why people go on from it to have success is that pretty common at Harvard to do work outside of your syllabus because I know um yeah it's a bunch of type a freaking weirdos who I took 12 AP classes you think I'm not gonna yeah I work outside the syllabus yeah that's a whole idea you know what I do that shit though like at least I went to temple in North Philly and people didn't really like at least in my department if I did like you'd have a vibrant campus life uh yeah it just required like it was like drinking and and hanging out like more people were focused on that then like in my broadcast television department most people weren't going out and making their own shit and I mean the whole ampune is the opposite of making your own shit it's an 140 year old organization it's the definition of buying and somebody else's shit like right you know I mean like yeah we're making a magazine but we've been making that magazine for 140 years it's not like I guess you're right but at the same time you're not you're not following a certain guideline don't you have a lot of freedom to to write what you want to write a true true in some ways but there's still a lot of tradition there's still a lot of you know kind of and I think that's especially once I became president that was kind of always the challenge of just trying to find the balance between tradition and trying to innovate and you know things have been going doing done a certain way for a while for a reason you know and so you never you don't want to you know reinvent the wheel but at the same time sometimes you look at things like I just don't want to do it this way anymore and why not do it some other way you said that there's like a lot of writing required like what is that actually mean how much are you writing and what is it in tail? So I mean to get on you just we have to write a lot of comedy pieces and you write several over the course of a whole semester you spend a whole semester trying to get on this thing and you still can not get on at the end of the semester potentially and I think during during my comp I might have written maybe 40 or 50 pieces of comedy I mean they're only like oh like a page but still that's 50 pages that's what small thesis versus of stupid really bad jokes so yeah yeah I write some people some people they're like I only had to write 10 you're like okay you're genius but I was just turning through I just trying to you know kind of throw everything at the wall that's generating my strategy of life just spaghetti at the wall you know see what sticks if I can catch a meatball you know how do you know when you have something that's good you write 140 pieces how you like okay 140 40 40 40 40 40 40 yeah whoa I wasn't that bad as you can see I'm really good with numbers yeah I'm not my 20 year yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I'm not from Tisha I'm not I was an economist sorry I wasn't the Ben Bernanke you know when something's good is it your gut no no you have so yeah you have um you have what are called comp directors and they tell you it's bad or it's good and they actually pick they're like these are your best ones so submit these and we'll judge you on these so you're just basically keep coming to them with like this is this good is this is like no no yes no no yeah no you know that's that's basically and these are for weeks yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah so you know I was a comp director and I tried to be nice uh I remember the the best thing about having to female literature comp directors which I don't think I'd ever happened before because it was me and the um vice president Eleanor Parker shout out to Ali uh I love her my future wife my future ex-wife wonderful and we had uh a comper who just would argue with us and it was the weirdest thing because we were the ones making the cuts and so a b we say okay um we think you should cut this joke and move this in this and you would just say no I don't think that's a good idea and we wouldn't look at each other go okay so we're gonna cut you right like you do you know what this how this works like I'm I'm gonna cut you if you don't do what I say I don't care what you think yeah I it's what I think and I'm just you're the one that's judging why the heck I'm the judge so like I'm just going to eliminate you from the process like do you not do like why do you keep coming back like do you want to be it seems like you want to be eliminated because like you're not gonna out smart me you're not gonna be like you know what he was right I was saying no it's so kind doesn't listen yeah and then that's the first you gotta go yeah you know it was the weirdest thing and I don't think it's happening anyone else and we're like what is going on like you don't all right I would have never thought to argue you're making the decision you know it's like the weirdest it's the weirdest thing it's like it's like you know um if you're waiter told you like oh you're not gonna have the gelato you're gonna have the cheesecake you be like um no like what do you understand I'm not I'm not gonna pay for that so don't bring it to me and I can leave like what's what this relationship is about this relationship where yeah I do you don't tell me what to do okay I tell you what to do so it was very odd but and I think it's like you know subtle things like that I think are definitely a sort of reflection of sort of race and gender dynamics sometimes because you know I'm sure he had never had a plaque until I wanted to do before right agree with them on something so it's first time for everything yeah he didn't get through did it or did he didn't change cut that mella fucker yeah snip um so this is what you became the president like that's a big deal that can't have been easy yeah no that was it that was fun yeah I don't know when did I happen what year oh 2014 or that was your junior year senior year yeah my junior year so it was been 24 jingles I'm class of 2015 yes yeah 2014 what's the process um it's like house cards RIP Kevin Spacey all right man you're like losing all your go to woo woo that's about clear Hollywood and out of them let's go yeah it's a fire sale 30% off right yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah that was like two season three season what spoiler you don't know who pushed you in front of a train but then when they see the train scene they're going to be like this is it wow I think you're on podcast the middle of that pot yeah yeah they blew it that's the one that I've ever seen in two years ago yeah um I've been know you've run and you're elected and it was it was a really hard time for me because my roommate had passed away um in a car accident and so it was just kind of a really like weird happy sad moment I've tried to be really open about talking about that because I think especially in the black community in the comedy community like we don't talk about mental health that much but I started going to therapy for the first time or because I was just like the sad is clown you know because I was trying to be president and stuff and then also trying to sort of more in her and also not wanting to deal with it and also trying to be a junior in college and have fun and so it was just kind of a weird combination of like happy sad emotions and so I think going through that is one of I was like one of my biggest challenges and now when I get super like hey just a press or whatever I just think like that that was so much harder you know that just doing with all that months and like I can make through that without completely offing myself then like okay like maybe I can do this so maybe I can make it through Tuesday just like in your casual Tuesday where I'm like a little sweaty on camera yeah I won't just friggin buff myself after this right it's all about the perspective you so oh okay so you had this this moment this period where you start to get a lot of attention which you called it it was like a perfect storm of black women comedy talk about that that month in that moment and why it was a significant and why you got pulled into it um well because it was right when SNI was getting a lot of flack for not having any black women and having keen and tops and just play all the black women ever um and also not even having that many black women host so there was still just keen and tops in playing black women um and the is so they hired such years made uh and Leslie Jones and um you know they were doing all of that and also it was it was black history months it was February um and so it just all it tells you it was a perfect story we just all kind of coalesced um and it was a sort of thing so I got elected and um a a good friend of mine and it was like really important mentor figured me as Michelle Martin and she used to have this show on MPR and I called her just because she knew I was running and I called her to tell her I won and she was like this is a story like you and Ellie come on the show and so that was kind of so we you know she was the one who I guess broke it or whatever and then we got all these other calls and you know I got to go on MSNBC we got um invited to women's history month event honoring Joe Jill Biden and so I got a really cool picture with Joe Biden that I use on my Tinder profile that's amazing um and he said I was a feisty one and he is right that's like the greatest Tinder profile but I didn't possibly do I just mean Joe like laughing it up like oh Joe you're crazy he's great yeah Uncle Joe man Uncle Joe so we just kind of thrown into this yeah yeah yeah so I mean it was and that's the other thing so without added to like the sad clown thingy because it's like oh I'm going on TV now and I don't really know how to be on TV and I still don't know how to be on camera you're doing great we'll see about that but yeah see how avatar you can make it's like just CGI like if you just like snapchat filter like hallyberry yeah one of the emoji faces yeah like poop emoji yeah it's just or eggplant you know like talking dick that's the penis yeah you know I think my voice could sound like a dick you know right this is a dick's voice if you were to be a character in a cartoon or a animated series you can hit the dick wow are you are you saying I would are you asking why you just seems like you were leading me they're asking the life buddy that was like hally it you had it that to me I don't fucking care you swan away yeah yeah it's just what like writers rooms are like it's just chaos it's like somebody's like come on guys get it together I was sorry I can really be more focused if you want to know I can really MS MS MSM you see this shit if you I actually prefer this this is what you know my my philosophy with this whole podcast is if I'm enjoying the conversation of the people probably will as well I think I honestly think that's true I feel like some of my favorite podcast and that's why I really liked another round shout out to another round because it was just us like talking and and we had you know questions and stuff but we're just having fun and I really like um these two drag queens Tricksie and Kachia they have a show and it's just them just talking about random stuff and it's so funny and I just like listening to the while I watch the dishes or something yeah these two goofballs so now they can listen to a beautiful baked potato for black cool men be verbally assaulted sure um by this guy who has a slave table and you won't believe what this podcast is saying to unless it's worth it you won't believe it you know what's funny is nobody has noticed yet that I've done like 35 podcast episodes and I've won a gray shirt every episode that's just the it's the patriarchy it's like when if I was a woman I feel like they would know yeah they would like don't you have another shirt it's all right yeah there was that Australian guy did that he wore the same suit for an entire year oh really yeah was it was it was it was it was it was it part of minimalism it wasn't actually Josh and Ryan who were uh the minimalists they just didn't interview with the guy right okay that's why I thought of that because I looked you up yeah you know what's it sure you did yes I did I didn't listen to the podcast but what's that yeah you're like this video I did because I told you like I told you I'll end up either doing a week invitation of somebody else I heard who I like or I will psych myself out and if I knew the recipe do you I definitely want to show up today that's good maybe I should stick yeah maybe I shouldn't tell people that that's probably a good thing yeah yeah and if you I sort of got if you don't see GI this it's going to be a magic I want movie magic I want windows movie makers slide like star wipe it's going to be you know like cool sound effect I'm not going back to we're not doing this yes we are where's we are we're doing it we're gonna we were really yeah yeah the good we had control of this like oh man you know I do these little teasers this is not it's only possible because they're from this one yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah people get offended if you know it's just a new thing people would just get very offended very easily and outraged as well I think okay my this is my big my big hot take on this this whole PC culture I think the thing is about comedy is if the only judge of if you are funny is the audience so if you can't perform at colleges or something you're not funny anymore that's just it it's like don't blame it on some cultural stuff yeah like the only like you're not the judge of objectively what's funny through all of time you know the the audiences that's what made you famous in the first place it's not because you thought you were really funny it's because the audience like maybe maybe you know that's not the right audience for you anymore you know it's just like there's different humor for different times it's like you know some things don't age well and you know that's that's not an objective you know you can't just say it's worse you know it's just such a dodgy it's like especially people who seem so progressive like have such a dodgy view of like comedy is just worse now it's like no it's just probably harder for you now yeah you know and that doesn't mean it's bad is I'm I think I think we're in you know in a lot of ways and a real goal made to comedy especially in TV and stuff I think oh yeah just eat a microwave I've gotten the right for you know human amazing shows that are really funny and and really um progressive in their own ways and and you know managed to do interesting things with interesting and diverse characters you know wow who the thunk it it's you know it's not that hard yeah also when you if you do have a big platform there's gonna it comedies always gonna offend somebody in some way for the most part it's cut it's pretty hard to be 100% clean not offend anybody right I mean the thing is I think the word offend is thrown around so loosely I mean I because I it's very rare that you hear someone saying I am offended you hear people say no you're offended you know what I'm saying like if something makes me mad if I don't like something it's very rare I'm not gonna say so you know say someone call me the end word I'm not offended I'm not gonna say I'm offended if the use of that word I'm just gonna say like fuck you yeah yeah you don't get to fucking call me that yeah and you know that come come one good upper cut yeah wow so the solar plate is a pow cave that chest and you know they suffocate yeah yeah yeah yeah after dark yeah I showed my chest boil yeah punch him in the solar plexus um that's a good teaser that's really good see you know it works you're giving me all the time that's a great point it's like yeah so people are obsessed with talking about being offended right but that's the thing you're not you're not offended you're you're angry or you don't like that or you or not funny right it's not funny I just don't find it funny and I think I've definitely been in arguments with people where it's like they make a stupid you know trainee joke or something and I'm like I don't like that that's not funny I don't I don't like it and it's like I'm sorry you're offended I'm like I'm not offended you didn't offend me I'm not a transexual person you're not talking about me yeah you know I'm personally not offended I'm I just think it's bad I just don't like it do better with the joke right that's just a bad joke right right but that I think now because of this whole and again it's always people accusing you of being offended you're never actually like I really I don't know if I've ever heard someone say I am offended you're not offended you know you're angry you're you don't like the joke you're concerned you know there's it's not it's not the word it's not a fence you know I take offense so that who even says that would say that it's crowns crazy coming out of someone's mouth but I think you know if you people say oh you're offended to to sweep your real concern under the rug you know it's like oh she just doesn't like that because she's easily offended it's like no I think you're a hack that's why I don't like it right and that's a little bit harder to take in it yeah you're just not funny that's why you're just like I think sometimes it comes from saying something just for the the value of being shocking yeah and being uh unpeasy right that's so easy you know anyone can just go around saying crazy words that we're not supposed to say anymore like that's hard that's oh that's hard hitting like no that's easy saying you know what's harder not doing that you know some of my favorite bits like some of my favorite comey and they go back and rots them out and like oh god that's regressive you know like like oh like like oh like that that the way that was phrase is not it's not helping you know like oh that's respect a bit of respectability politics that's not that's not good you know I might go cut that out of that never happened yeah we were just rooted through that away but I think yeah I think there's the the outrageous sort of just a weird you know don't fight with your audience that's that's that's a that's a fool's errand like what are you doing don't fight with your audience just either to make them laugh or don't you know are you hesitant to put your stuff out there in that once you do like you said a lot of stuff or some of the stuff at least one age well or uh you'll look back at it I always look back work two years ago and think oh man like I that's bad oh yeah oh yeah I remember reading I mean I go back and read my old stuff all the time and think oh my god I'm a hack I'm a hack I'm a talentless talentless hack um and I always will be but I tried not to let that stop me and also I tried not to I give myself room to grow and and I think also being limping president and getting like actual like death threats like kind of now like this is this one guy kept sending weird packages to lampoon building with like KKK songs in them it was very weird um yeah weird is the word for it yeah that's the word right yeah um as like okay um and then like with pictures of him like in the shower it was easy it's oh I once I got hit on by a new Nazi at a bar oh my god it's crazy like there's a weird neo Nazis want some of this you know they really they they they they want it they want this big potato it's it's the ones we're like in the bible belt it's like porn searches are all right and the other area you know in a racial yeah yeah you know they want it you know that's a big psychic freaking yeah my intro I seriously in L.A. I kid you not got hit on by a new Nazi at actual neo Nazi with an actual swastika tattoo at the bar it was crazy oh yeah please tell me about it was he traveling or is this his home he lives you don't know it I didn't okay so I'm so I'm at the bar right and I don't even want to tell you what time was it was too late yeah yeah I was at the bar and I'm like with a couple friends and I'm just standing there and it's just guys and in front of me he has a red hair and he's like kind of mussely you know typical kind of like white L.A. looking actor dude like a little bit too mussely and a two tight of a shirt and you know blonde or red hair or blonde any color yeah you pick white and yeah I have a figure you know it's a sim just creative sim yeah and he's standing in front of me but he's not ordering and so I'm you know do the thing around like oh you know do you need to order can I just order to look like and he's like yeah yeah sure um and then he I think what my name is and he's kind of cute and I was like oh Alexis and he said okay and we're just talking kind of and I ordered my drink and I just sort of you know how how's your night blah blah blah and I'm kind of a little drug oh my god and I look and I see tattoos but I'm not like it's kind of dark and I'm not looking too carefully at them and he I don't know what I said but then he said something and like well you know bits because Jews control the media and I went what and I was kind again I'm kind of drunk so I'm like is he looking at him like is he Jewish like is this is like a self-deprecating kind of like we control the media it's a myth you know yeah right right like is he a men's like what are we doing here right and I was like what and he's like yeah you know Jews control the media you should definitely try to expose yourself some non-Jew led media and I looked at him and I was like are you are you joking right I couldn't read I was I was so and and then I I just said I I don't I don't know I think I just made a mouth in a ways um and then I because I was looking at him and then I see that he has a literal swastika right there and I went oh my god oh my god notty notty notty notty I was like looking for a button to push like where's like like nine or one there's like yeah we got nothing we got what we got like a net piece of job like where's like I need like a light alert like notty but like yeah that's what I was like I'm like who do I tell like somebody's got to know like he's just right here he's talking to me and like hitting on me and stuff and like what's going on like I was great and I think they're needs to be a notty nine one button because I didn't I was like yeah what should I do I might do I fight him like yeah I do we have to go back no I don't know like I need to be a hand guy like you know like I'm like is he really I was just I was too drunk to like really yeah and you were enjoying the conversation so much yeah it was just that one thing yeah this is weird I think about Jews yes he he says weird about Jews I'm like but he seems to have no problem and but then it really made me think what is it about me that he thinks like I would be amenable to like anti-Jew talk like here here buddy yeah I hate those Jews too like what don't use that it's so much Jesus right hey hey after John and Alexis yeah anti-Semitic well now yeah that's the headlines right themselves really no I feel like yeah but once you want you know for somebody like him to have those views you tend not to be rational on all fronts you know where I guess there's just a disconnect it just it seemed like it just he seemed like a totally normal guy except he has like a weird hang up about Jews yeah you know everything else right about him normal and like very nice he said I was pretty and like again and also but I'm just like why are you hitting on me why do you think I hate Jews I'm like do I look anti-Semitic yeah like why why would you come up to me and you know what this black girl hates use I'm like oh oh yeah yeah yeah yeah let's try to find some common values comes out yeah we can hit that yeah yeah I'm gonna get hit that yeah it's to and the bars goes the way let

what you want me to do sharpened in pencils what do you want it was and he's like no like a real writer you know just a real real actual writer and so yeah I couldn't say no to that so packed up mootella I don't really like it uh I like just not my type of city generally everyone's a little too pretty uh they're beautiful here I like going places where I'm at 10 like roll the we see Anna yeah

yeah yeah you were like Joe Biden so what you might have been hated the Jews yeah yeah oh it's really difficult yeah it is a yeah LA so that part's not good there's got to be other stuff oh the food is great I love the food the weather is okay I do miss seasons I can't tell if I'm aging very rapidly or like not at all like I don't know the passage of time oh okay it's so confusing without like cold Wisconsin must be terrible in the winter like come on it is but it's kind of we I mean walking for a while was a drunkest city in America and that's right and that's fun because you just you just stay in the house your door is frozen shut and you just get shwasted and you know throw your beer cans at gear when I come in the backyard and so there's an explanation right you go you go out to the frozen lake and you know have some and you're you know best friend from high school tells you they're bisexual you know it's like that's sort of stuff yeah like you can't get that in LA no you can't do that you know that's sort of Dawson's Creek Degressiash shit can only happen in the cold place my friend what do you do out here at Hollywood High it's like go to a club we can make you soft right soft yeah week yeah so soft that's what I do I teach you know I lived in Brooklyn and New York for probably about five years and but that's part of that is like it's almost too hard and too just like I feel like I need like it doesn't make you hard it just makes you mean I think there's different to you any hard we're hardy people you know we can deal with the cold and the heat but we're still very kind New Yorkers are both whiny and mean you know and you're not hard you still complain about the snow all the time you know like you live in fucking New York yeah that's what happens yeah you know it's not it's not it's not hard it's just mean yeah but I love New York wow I mean I'm a kind so you fit in for me you know I can throw in both on the sidewalk knocking babies out the shoulders you know like woo yeah I think it's about being resilient because when I lived in New York it's like to do your laundry you'd have to like walk across three lanes of traffic yeah yeah and Williamsburg oh yeah yeah we didn't have a moment people back there I didn't shop at Westell I'm going up in the world my friend yes I have the Florgen Dirk yeah I'm a key of it now I've got this beautiful yeah

you got you got you got the chest boils yeah we got it all this episode has everything yeah it's really I think it's gonna inspire some people wow I didn't even realize that this was possible the conversation could be so random yeah but I can't even get like a one good through life now there's a through lot we keep jumping in and out and we're dolphin yeah I'm proud of this episode resilience and Brooklyn and L.A. so L.A. you think you're gonna be out here for a while um if I was not gonna keep making money yeah yeah I'm kind of I'm still still that same uh hustling bitch at the end of the day I kind of go over the money goes so yeah I could see myself moving to New York get some points or you know I've been traveling a lot I was in Sweden recently um and I was in Barcelona earlier this year I love to travel so and I like you know making enough money where I can afford to do that so I just and I've been directing more and and so you know there's just a lot of sort of stuff going on and a couple years in this whole crazy what do you mean you just moved out here a couple years ago mm-hmm you started working yeah it feels like both a very long time and a terribly short time like you know I guess it's been all two years and some change yeah and it feels like I'm like oh I've been out here forever why aren't I ridiculously famous already yeah why isn't it happening yeah I should be like I should have an Oscar right now with the thick um and then the other part of me is like only when I have for two years like why am I so bored of myself mm-hmm it's the overthinking I think that it just requires patience yeah it does and I just I go through periods of you know I try I was in it ill health for a lot of this year and I so I try not to be too hard on myself because of that because it's like the health is the most important thing you know that you can have and you're we only have one body unfortunately no matter how many people I kill I can't we'll see it's 2017 we got 3D printing on them frozen so you know I'm hoping that one day I can just go out and was out and Wisconsin yeah underneath the lake yeah that's like a new show right there that's like the after dark we go dig up those bodies yeah what kind of directing you've been doing that's exciting um like sketches I have a movie that I wrote that I want to direct and how well do you fish for I'm very excited about that we had a table read for it it was awesome really wow that's great yeah it was super super exciting and um so yeah it's all it's all happening and I just I was talking to um friends recently and I just I think a lot of my friends I feel like I've been getting to a good place where I've managed to like I know there's there's I feel like there's a whole like culture like I cut people off like that you know and I definitely I love that culture because I feel like I've managed to cut a lot of like toxic people out of my life and now like I just have like a really core group of like good people that like I can call them in the middle of night and be like I'm freaking out and then I'm freaking out too and we can be like oh I don't know or like like or I'll come down it's gonna be okay and so I think I'm really lucky for that and I think it took a while to like develop that community of people and I'm lucky I think that I really close to my sister even though she's a New York um shout out to Rachel I miss you it's hard it's hard when you move away from family yeah that was a big thing for me come at the LA I was like ah because I've got six brothers and sisters

hello and then be like one solitary egg sitting there on a rocking chair like we haven't had a visitor you know like what's what they're like we're gonna have a baby in here it's like clean the cobwebs up like oh my god something's happening I'm like I don't know if it's possible it might be condemned yeah you know yeah yeah yeah yeah just shut it down I've been taking birth control regulations I was like 15 I wasn't having any mistakes nobody wanted to have I was at least 16 15 year old yeah you know it's not an adult you know not American beauty not an American horror story and we're like yeah I feel like we had very similar job yeah it's like the sister's high sperm count there you have the size details details it's not like it's too caught in the weeds here the weeds of sperm count yeah did you have another more topical what do you wanted to ask about like struggling and working hard and yeah like whether the show well I guess so you're starting to direct now and you're starting to was there ever this feeling of what's next like what should I do now now that you got these great shows on your belt yeah I mean that's all I think that's the constant feeling I feel like you know that's my my lowest points are when I'm not thinking that I'm always trying to you know one expand my portfolio because I feel like you know I mean my dream is to you know 20 years from now be able to like just walk into any company or whatever and like creatively get whatever I need done you know like Shonda Rhimes I'm like I'm making a graphic novel a sample yeah a graphic novel time you know that's that's that's what I want they're like I tell me I might have a television show a movie a graphic novel and I'm doing a one act playing also just because I can and you know everyone's just going to make it happen for me because I'm that good and so I think in your life written articles and stuff and and done you know now I'm doing movies and TV I wrote for the Emmys and I'm directing and you know so I just more just kind of adding more and more feathers to my large voluminous hat right it's I think that's like the goal for a lot of people is to get to a point where they can do anything creatively they want that they can just say okay I have this idea let's make it happen yeah I think you also have to enjoy the work that you're doing now because sometimes when I was making minimalism it was it was very stressful I worked really long hours like 12 hour 13 14 hour days like for three four months straight editing working towards a deadline it was just living off the peanut butter sandwiches and coffee and I love peanut butter sandwiches it was the one crunchier creamy I mix like I like the crunchy I don't what I'm gonna leave I saw myself answering I was like I was like what would it let's just what because I like I don't have a left for question yeah what are you like yeah now I like crunchy I generally I do I get the crappy like whole foods organic that you have to like oh god why do you hate yourself and why do you spend so much money to hate yourself it's right there it's what's what's what's what's what's what's good but they have to throw it away for you trade it goes with the same shit it's cheap but it's also go to trade or go to vans you freaking there is that millennial you don't even have it around here wrong with you yes they do go to the freaking seven eleven on the corner and get it for two dollars yeah god you're your marble table and whatever you would do yeah yeah yeah yeah you might just eat a fucking peanut it's okay it's cheaper get a big back of peanut and just make your own buttery I'm actually I'm on a 30 day vegan challenge right now that's probably in a killing size I'm after dark punch in the soul yeah yeah yeah it's gonna be like Mortal Kombat yeah that's like I hate myself my whole family hates me they've actually abandoned me at this point because like you moved to LA he's doing yoga oh yeah I'm not doing it looks great he's glowing yeah yeah yeah I haven't gotten in my LA I but I my goal for this year my year so I just turned 25 on the 11th and my goal for this year is to just get like significantly good looking yeah you know I'm gonna like lose 50 pounds game 10 pounds of muscle yeah be able to crack a walnut with my ass cheeks oh that's that's a good right see it's good because you're not it's not like these superficial goals it's like you can't really specifically yeah yeah I'm gonna like have just a bunch of walnuts in every week just give it one chance it's a good to like get there also good to fall back on if this whole comedy that could be a thing for you right where like yeah to have the fall back like really like yeah I mean yeah my fallbacks include um well I have my economics degree I always well I think I could always go get my MFA um which I almost did right after college I think about maybe going to graduate school and some other capacity and then of course there's always the oldest professional prostitution and I'm it's always there and my vagina is dusty but not that dusty yeah yeah yeah still couldn't fetch a nice price on the open market yeah yeah and now with the technology these days I won't even have to leave my house so I'll just do in calls that's really good yeah they probably have an app for it at this point yeah you know just being being being make money yeah right yeah so that like a dollar 15 cents I can't do that I can't fall back on prostitution I can't fall back on pimping I'm a young savvy business owner I'm just for Noah yeah he's a entrepreneur yeah he made an app yeah pimping yeah pimper yeah pimper yeah oh yeah so our pimper yeah oh have you heard about rumble I don't know if it's real or not but have you? Is that the one the fighting that I don't know what's so much that was my favorite potentially fake or real of yeah I really have said about that you loved it I was like let me fight yeah I broke my first nose and the third grade home me I was a scrappy you were ready to go yeah yeah I mean I told you American Horror Story nobody was trying to like get with this so that's a lot of yeah I'm just thinking now that's one of the things like a lot of people when they go on Tinder these online dating sites so like well they look nothing like their photo potentially dangerous with that app because then you're like oh my god oh my god he's having foot tall also but no who am I fighting like someone just comes up and decks you like wait it was you yeah okay what's it you know there's so opening family guy with the red hat yeah can he just comes up from behind yeah not so much you yeah I thought there's gonna be a battle or something yeah right the kidney he's got dreads now okay all right open one all right all right for that time my next flight yeah quick lift to the flight the future's pretty great I'm pretty excited about where it's where it's going I mean LASA's capitalism where we have to rent out everything that we own yeah yeah it works pretty great for not when you don't own who's ever in left yeah where we own absolutely nothing just use the products of our production as our probably well it's probably good for the environment and stuff I guess is it yeah I don't know these things are too big and complex for me I know this is yeah I can't even I can't even get my couple a lot of issues today already and I'm like my head is spinning yeah we love people more confused I don't know we've elucidated anyway yeah but I think that's what life is it's very confusing it is it's a messed up messed up world man yeah it's hard to it's hard to figure out which direction do you think do I sound do I have a deep voice to you I don't think so I can never tell because I can get very screech I think I have like a good range you have a range you know I have a range can you say no not at all no do you carry two no you don't have I don't think I don't know if that's a thing but I that is a thing it's somebody somebody said actually that's a myth I okay my ex boyfriend was Tom Duff I swear to god you'd say like jingle bells jingle bells and he'd go like jingle bells I swear to god you're like can you hear like can you hear like he couldn't sing even just nursing rhymes like at the correct I'm in the middle like when I started to play guitar it started I helped a little bit but I definitely can't sing I started guitar I think it'd be like I'm gonna be the next Jack Johnson like it's gonna be a thing and then like I know you're one of those yeah like in high school in college come on like everybody had that very white guy had that everybody's gonna act or so I need to get a guitar yeah did you go your hair along you have a rat tail okay I'm not gonna answer that I didn't have a rat tail I didn't have a rat tail but you saw it yeah it was done I had a bird's nest I had the big puffer and I don't have to always have to wear a beanie because it was not the beanie that the kid on the beanie because it was just in the beanie yeah that's the look the transition to like doing this where I showed forehead like so I got it I made it all sexy that's how you know with your adult there was a grown man there's a big transition grown sex time yeah I was a little forehead yeah I was really nervous about show the little show the ladies up well brow yeah yeah I didn't do well with the ladies before then you see my my forehead no trust me not in college what's the hiding in that beanie yeah yeah full of secrets yeah um we didn't do well in college oh no not really no I like I was dating somebody going into college it was like the lucky move yeah like in high school I was like rookie move hey let's do this long distance thing everyone she was a year below me so my whole year my first year I was in a relationship and then she went to college and then we broke yeah as you do as you do as you do actually I do know something I mean the thing is you do that you get married those are the only options yeah you don't do somewhere in between I think I knew where I was having but I was too much of a pussy to speak my mind and you actually be honest with myself honest emotional honesty is really hard yeah and that's why I hide all of mine behind a thick layer of humor and and you know just emotional fallacies yeah no no one can really figure out how I'm feeling at any given moment this is a very vulnerable moment for me right now are you like that in a relationship where I mean it's it's like all jokes but then you got I told you I'm the real person right you get the real talk I yeah I do get the real talk but also I have a crazy temper I get I get a little temper I get a little testy I get testy especially when I'm stressed out I'm a I can I'm a big I I did a guy who came from a very sort of like emotionally reserved family and I'm a come from a big family of we yell you know I'm like we can yell and then it's over you know and then we don't we we settled it we yelled it all out now but it's you know he'd be like why are you yelling stop yelling you know like you seem so much more than you are like I'm not even that mad but I'm like screaming yeah you know and it's just like oh my god this one is crazy and so but that's how you show affection yeah that's not my love language yeah I didn't see that in the book that my mind was just yeah that's the eighth love language yeah that's my yeah I pitched which whale you know like a witch being thrown off a ship in the storm you know that's what I mean I think for me like humor in a relationship is one of the most important things yes but I can't did a guy who's not funny yeah and like it's just like you have to enjoy yourself and you can't be serious all the time but then but you do have to have the real talks you have to have like communication is so important so important I think yeah I think I've gotten a lot better about and I mean I'm I'm that one of those friends who you know I give myself very good advice and I get my friends very good advice very very seldom follow my own advice but I'm a big believer in like TTR guys to find the relationship because I think everybody gets all you get in your feelings and you get hurt when you don't just just have the conversation and like if you break up with your of your situation ship as most of these things usually are like because you decided to be like hey and I mean don't do it don't do it in like a needy like what are we you know when it's going on and you see being other people but well they just be like yo dude what's up you know like I and I've just gotten way better about that be like listen here's the deal you know like you know this is a casual thing right now and like if you want to be monogamous and you be monogamous a lot of you people coming out here claiming you're ethically non monogamous no you're fucking not that's a lie you're not polyamorous you a ho okay so just own your ho own your ho I literally I was just in the right of you like a week ago and I had this whole rant about Holdness and whole lifestyle and I'm just like I'm a ho and I own it okay I'm not I'm not polyamorous I'm not well no I just I date multiple people at once and I'm a figure out which one I like that's that's just it and like don't try to make it a pathology or something bigger than that and another thing I just was talking to this kind of dating last night about this where it's like you're you're not a sociopath or you're not emotionally sounded you're an asshole you're just a regular old asshole don't you don't make it a pathology so you can feel special you're not special you're just a dick like you just don't care enough about people to be nice to them like it's you're not a sociopath you know I'm mostly sounded you're under there are millions and millions of men like you most men are like you in like I feel like you know people pathology so that way they can get away with them like me being a Libra for example exactly yeah it's a great excuse it can just never make a decision yeah the I mean that that communication so important I learned that too it's like you go with your so much stress with so many relationships because you are like oh but what are they going to say oh they're not going to like me oh my like just stop overthinking yeah have a conversation to do it and and the thing is like whatever comes of it was going to come with it anyways that's the thing like I've never it's never been you know if you're really liking someone and they don't like you as much you were going to break up anyways yeah so they're just ripped the freaking band off and move on girl unless you're like a weirdo and you say it on the second date like the give it some time yeah yeah there's a balance but well because that's the thing you had to play a little bit of a game you can't over communicate in the beginning but then once you break through those walls then you can open yourself up yeah I usually just do kind of by time I feel like after I had a friend who had been dating this guy for I think almost seven or eight months and like I've had never had any sort of relationship talk at all I'm like crap it's been eight months like is he dating other people do you know like do you care like it's like yeah I wouldn't want him to and I'm like well why don't you it's been eight months like it's like you can have a baby you know you're gonna be you would have been pregnant and had a baby and they had it takes you like life could have been created like that's for that's for me like nine my nine months you that at full-term it's a full-term relationship and we need to talk about what's going on here because then because then you act all shot when it comes out they're like oh you're dating three other girls or something like that it's like girl you didn't have to talk with him and so you can't be mad you want to do quick questions yeah do a fire round is wrap it up this is going to be we're doing a firefighter rapid fire it's quick questions not quick answers though so oh okay I mean you just take as much time as you want with him okay um what book has made the biggest impact on your life I'd probably say breakfast of champions by Kurt Vonnegut I just really like it I don't know if it's them has the most impact but it's one of my favorite books and I think it's just I like I like just really love Kurt Vonnegut as an author which I feel like it's very cliche for some reason but I'm kind of like Kurt Vonnegut I think it's funny and especially when I was sort of still doing like sciencey mathy stuff it was kind of like right up my alley of like humor and math and science that and I think ant farm by Simon Rich which was the book that um this guy Zach gave me when I was first camping lampoon and he was he probably I think he read my stuff was like oh she's bad and gave me that book because I'm like here read this this will make you better do you read you read more than you watch no absolutely not I shouldn't write me to read way more it's hard to find I'm basically a literate I have I have someone right here yeah I'm like don't jump this down jump this down it's a joke yeah all right you ready penis pee yeah yeah I have a 19 20s like radio what is this yeah I don't know what I can do together mama's gonna spin you a yarn what one skill have you leveraged in a way that you think others haven't oh one skill have I leveraged is it like college entry by sitting bullshitting but I'm a great liar I think because I am just so ridiculous that people can't tell when I'm lying usually or not not necessarily lying I think I actually wrote a whole article I think about bull being a good bullshitter and in the sense that like you know like fudging little things on your resume or just convincing people that I can do things that I have not done you know like I um my first job was well not my first job on my first job in college I was interning at an e-commerce company out in Queens living in Brooklyn um in Brooklyn Heights in a frat house that I found on Craigslist for 500 dollars a month it's a whole other can of worms as a story um but I so I had to take the trade into the city and go back out of the city also shit show and I remember my boss came out to me and I just got an all-ampune and I was just looking for something to do and I wanted to be New York and I found the job ad on Craigslist went out there moved out there um and my boss comes up to me and he's like hey Lex is you right for the onion right and I was like yeah sure something like that yeah and so he's like okay here can you can you write copy for all these gag gifts and I was like yeah definitely totally completely I know I don't want to write copy I'm not a copy writer I given that I applied for a job as a copywriter I'd never written no word of copy in my freaking life I just you know so I'm just I'm good I'm good liar and I and I also because I think I'm a quick learner so by the time you figure out my lying I'm lying I've already figured it out yeah that's like ethical lying you know it's lying that doesn't hurt anybody but you're also not really lying no no you're just omitting facts yeah it's like all to be stretching proof all to you yeah that Lexus has her own facts yeah um no but I think you have to do that in the beginning it's crazy because you're you have to get the opportunity to get your foot in the door as long as you're gonna back it up and work your ass off exactly and I think that's the other thing I try to you know my mom also used to say like show improved you know like you can do a whole lot of this but like put the parts on the table make the result so you know I try to think of myself in situation where I can't produce the results and you know once I produce the results you're not gonna be mad that I lied to you you're gonna be like oh so great I have this person you know on my team so what does drive you money money I'll take money for 500 Alex no I mean I don't know I want to be able to support myself and support my family and money and having like I think money is more of a proxy for just control over my life yeah and I think it's just the easiest proxy for that if that makes sense you know you can't control a lot of things and especially in my life like I've experienced a lot of death especially like random death like my dad just randomly getting stage four colon cancer and dying within a year and my roommate in the car accident and my own health issues and you know and just sort of all these random things that you can't control but I can be significantly wealthy and that is one thing that I know that I can do and that can help alleviate other problems and I think on it in addition to that just having creative control and I think those all go hand in and where like you know the more money I make the more I can be able to be like I'm not doing this you know I don't want to do this I don't need to do this for the money because I have money you know and I can just do things that are really creatively fulfilling to me and and tell the stories that I want to tell I mean I kind of my manager's gonna hear this and like you sound like a comedy prostitute and like this is like say you like writing jokes I love writing jokes yeah if I would do it for free no I don't do anything free yeah but yeah no I think I I think just having creative control and that's why I started directing and I like it so much just because especially for like a control freak like me it's like oh I can have my fingers and everything it's like you know it's getting the candy stuff I love I just like I want all the levers in my life you know I just want all the buttons all the levers I want to be in the control seat at all times and I feel like the more things I can use to to make that happen to happier that I genuinely am I just don't like feeling out of control so maybe that's more worth driving me control that sounds scary too doesn't it that you're out of control and we're like no that I just need control yeah but the money thing to say yeah a lot of people have negative a negative relationship with money like a needing money of thinking that money is a bad thing I don't think it's inherently good or bad no I think most people are really bad with money though yeah they're not they're not smart with their money I go back and forth sometimes I I sports some when I should save and vice versa right we make all these excuses well I work really hard I did this this and this so I deserved it by this marble tape yeah slaves yes you got to stop saying it It's awful it's no i'm not saying this is going to ruin my reputation I'm going nowhere in this town. Gives up my pot Yeah yeahώς I'm bringing up but I think money money is important I graduated with a hundred thousand dollars in student loan I bought my condolences and I bought my pee I bought a new car So I was in it. I was a kid. Why would you do that who told you to do that to my right a bike to my benefit was a Kia So it was in a great car, but even it was a scooter that me too expensive for you You need a unicycle. No, I made mistakes. Thanks for me. Where'd you even get the credit to buy a car with a hundred thousand dollars a dead my car I'm co-signed The co-signed but I can't pay that shit off some of us parents have terrible credit Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I do we honestly learn to Craigslist for jobs I wouldn't actually if like I'm not gonna do that for my kids. I'm not gonna co-sign as crazy You can't co-sign it out there and make some money go go go just don't buy the thing All day is where you put you made your kid put on some blind man's glasses and had and made them begg with a tin cup industry You know while they were still cute. Yeah, you know that's a big mic We need that get out there and dance Yeah, she can tell further make a make a dollar. Oh, no, it's on my problem Nobody else me That's what Questlove did drumming on the streets Is that Rob's broke yeah, yeah, yeah, figure it out One chat too That's great. I should get Questlove Actually speaking of getting like big people on the podcast important people I'm trying to get the rock on my podcast. I don't know if you noticed but there is a photo of their I did see it and I did do the sign of the cross. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm using it I try to make every everybody as they come through the door It's yeah, so that's my big stretch goal is if I can get the rock on the podcast There's about people stories of building something around up and the rock is that the ultimate sign of somebody who's Who's had an amazing story, but he's also continued to To hustle and make it happen. Yeah, and that's a great photo. I saw a couple of people just like that for Halloween Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, pretty awesome people are doing it now. This is actually me embodying the secret Like they should you have a vision board? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I was actually gonna do that with like a thousand photos of that image just like duplicated This is gonna be like burps in your marketing It's okay I think this could actually go into like having evident like if it he does come on the podcast I think that's a pretty good evidence for the secret does exist Yeah, yeah, I believe in the secret. I definitely I mean, I definitely Manifest things and I think I'm too afraid to not believe in the secret. I mean, what's the harm in the yeah? What's the harm in the world? What's it gonna do make you believe in yourself too much? Oh, you know You know what what what what bad thing can happen Yeah, the worst I can happen. The worst I can happen is that you're just the annoying person That always talks about the secret. Yeah, yeah, and like speed positive You're like I can some terrible things are happening. I mean, I'm dying. Yeah, you know Talking about the secret is annoying. Yeah, yeah, I don't know why you brought it up. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah It's definitely I'm definitely 100% serious about the secret. No, okay It's okay. Let them know you can't let the know yeah that it's that you you don't believe It's free Jim Karen some cruise coming Yeah, you never know I don't believe they're listening right now In my head um I I believe in the secret in the secret inside in the certain thing. I think my life. I mean, I also I try to I think I do very regularly is just Like from mind myself how like super fucking dope my life is already like I've already done so much more than I ever thought Possible like I got to meet Joe Biden man, you know I Katy Perry called me out first name and last name on Instagram All right, which was dope and I didn't even have an Instagram at the time. Yeah. It was dope. It was so cool What you do like when you saw that you just lose your life. So my friends I didn't have an Instagram It's in my friends. I'm gonna be like I'm gonna be best friends with Katy Perry and I'm like no, what are you talking about? At least I mean the post where he's like shout out to BJ no back and like this We'll get to and I was like So if I check it she couldn't even tag makes I didn't even have a damn you blew it I blew it early mistakes But I mean obviously not just like celebrity stuff, but like yeah I got to be president of lampoon and I have a Harvard degree like what am I really mad about you know like What am I what am I what am I really upset about like I I think I've already you know I honestly I think I could like die happy you know like I've done so much more than you know Even right now like I say this to my friends sometimes, especially when like we're having a particularly good night I'm like you know some people on earth, although there were whole lives and never have a date as good as this one Ever yeah never be as like healthy and happy and well off and Hopefully about the future and have the opportunities that we have right now like half of the people on earth probably You know So I just try to remind myself of that and then you know that I'm just like okay What am I let's focus on the next thing what am I what am I really complaining about at this point? Yeah, all right What one thing should people read listen to or watch before they put a bit tonight? This is a time for plug right plug time You should Watch the episode of two things you should watch the episode of Brooklyn 99 Called servant protect from not this current season but the past one I appear on camera I make my small screen date you can see my head very clearly in the scene where the writers of this fake show appear And so me and the guy wrote the episode with both appear So it's very meta So watch that episode serving protect 99 and I wrote the episode is my first like written by credit of TV so very exciting and then also go on funny your die and watch PC plantation if you search PC plantation and funny your eye it should come up and that is my like Directorial debut She took that out to and follow me on Twitter and you know watch my tweets Great, so if that's if people want to connect with the online twitters the place Yeah, yeah, definitely I answer my DMs most of the time If when I remember It's at oh god, it's Alexis it's a pretty easy to remember You've got great tweets. Thank you. Yeah, really fine. I try my I do the best I can for the people. Yeah Sorry, miss all right, Alexis. Thank you so much for coming on the show. Thank you so much All right Whoa, we did it right in it. Oh, right Okay, that was so bad So I told you guys that this one was a little bit off the rails I hope you had as much fun listening as I did talking with Alexis I'm pretty sure that there was a positive message somewhere between the lines of this show I'm sure of it a lot of great insights there, but I think At the bare minimum you can just see how somebody's path can change radically and how you really need to go with your gut and and really pursue what you're passionate about pursue what you love and If biomedical engineering isn't for you if you feel like you're not going to be happy doing it Please do not do it just for the money. There's plenty of job options out there for you There's plenty of career paths out there Where you can make good money and still fulfill something that you're passionate about still fulfill those desires in you You guys can follow me on social media If any of you guys follow me on social media I've been creating these really short inspirational videos from the podcast Instagram is really the best place to to find me and get those little daily hits of inspiration You can find me at Matt Diavella. That's M-A-T-T-D-A-V-E-L-L-A Those who have been following me there know that I've been working on an indie Google campaign with some friends. I partnered to create the videos and help With the messaging behind a physical product called packed It's spelled P-A-K-T and the campaign is coming to an end and it was Really successful so up until this recording right now We've got over $900,000 close to a million dollars in crowdfunding for that campaign Which has been amazing for me and the others on the team including Josh and Ryan from the minimalist It was really an opportunity to to see if we could sell a physical product ethically Responsibly morally in a way that that really aligned with our values so that was It was certainly a learning lesson and what it takes to bring a physical good to the market I think obviously with the crowdfunding campaigns and indie gogos and kick starters of the world It's become much easier and much more affordable to do that though there are always costs and Different aspects of the process that you don't really fully understand until you take part in it So for that alone, it's been an amazing experience and looking forward to seeing how this grows beyond the campaign I guess I should describe what the actual product is. It's a bag. It's a travel bag. It's you know Essentially, I would call it a minimalist travel bag. It's something that you can You should be able to use In replacement of every other bag you have so it's got the ability to store a lot of stuff It's store not so much it acts as a duffel bag a carry on bag a laptop bag and everything in between It's really neat in how they designed it Anybody who knows me knows that I'm a big fan of design I really I'd certainly take that to heart and everything that I do and This is one of those products that I think is beautifully done I actually personally don't use the bag. I think it's great But it doesn't really fit my lifestyle perfectly because I'm more of a backpack guy Just for me in terms of getting around quickly and easily I find having the two straps on a backpack is more comfortable for me though Lots of people have apparently gotten value out of this this Pack bag because we've sold I think close to 5,000 at this point Which is pretty cool to see that response so I think you still have time now if you go to gopack.com It's GOPAKT dot com and from there you'll you'll be able to Potentially crowdfund and get a bag for yourself if you want it, but as we've been saying from the very beginning If you do not need a new bag then please do not buy this bag We are still minimalist we still believe that you should be very thoughtful on intentional about every single decision That you make everything that you bring into your life So if you don't need a new bag please do not buy this bag Next week is a really exciting episode We've got ashore wroth on the podcast many of you will know that name He is a rapper best known For his hit song I love college which actually came out seven years ago Around seven years ago at this point and he's been busy since then his path is amazing So he went from being thrown into this system and the big major record label system tied to hundreds of thousands of dollars in Industry money and Unplugging from that system and trying to find his own way and his own path and going the independent route since then and he's put out some incredible music That I really want to encourage everybody to go check out but his story to getting there is just as good Inspiring and we talk about We actually talk about sneaker culture and some of the problems with buying compulsively We talk about being conscious and Being aware of your surroundings and creating art in a meaningful way so Definitely stay tuned for that one next Wednesday Lastly to wrap it up If you want to leave a review for the ground up show that would be hugely helpful In getting the word out. It's super simple. It takes 10 seconds to do But it really makes a big impact on the show and it really helps to get the word out it increases the visibility Through iTunes rankings so that way more people will be able to See the show and get value from it and also it'll just allow me to keep doing what we're doing here Which has been really and lightning for me. It's been Such a learning process. It's given me the ability to meet with some amazing and Bright individuals people like Alexis people like Asher And everybody in between like at this point have interviewed filmmakers of interviewed journalist and comedy writers and comedians wrappers Coming up on the show. We've got photographers. We've got who else news anchors Intent we'll see who that one is There's a lot of really really good guests coming on the show that I'm excited about and it just keeps growing and I think one of the coolest things about this and and one of the things that I want to do all along and this is one of the reasons why I actually talk about the podcast on the show and I talk about the growth and what I'm trying to learn what I'm learning from the show and what I'm trying to bring into it is the fact that The podcast is that Talking about the experience of growing this thing will actually help and teach other people how to grow their own Fill in the blank whether it's a podcast or a blog or a graphic design business You're watching me build this thing from the ground up. I started with practically no listeners and it's been All about following the principles that I have learned from the very beginning and what I learned through my own freelance business is put in the hard work do it every single day Put your head down keep going keep working keep busting your ass And changing it up experimenting trying new things and above all learning so that's been an amazing experience from this this podcast And yet it's a little bit meta to talk about the podcast within the podcast, but Like I said, I think and I hope that you guys have gotten some value out of that so I'm gonna wrap it up here I just want to thank you guys again for listening and we'll see you next week you
