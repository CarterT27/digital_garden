 I got rid of all of that stuff. I didn't get rid of all of our stuff, but another big change in our life is happening. We're moving. It's funny how you can get attached to a place. These past two years have been the most transformative of our lives. That's not how you pack. I told you, we don't go inside the box. The things go in the boxes. This was our first apartment in LA. A city we settled down in, a happy compromise as we split our time, visiting families, in New Jersey, and Sydney. This is the apartment we were living in when we got engaged. It's just tripped down here. It's going to be an engaging weekend. No, you're lying. No, you're lying. And married. Spoiler alert. We got married at a drive-through chapel in Vegas, and we kept it largely secret for the past eight months. You find yourselves here at the World Famous, Little White Wedding Chapel in Las Vegas, Nevada. It's in this apartment that I decided to go for it. To drop all freelance work and dedicate myself to making this whole YouTube thing work, it's a place where I struggled to find my footing. Inside these walls I experienced more doubt about my future than anywhere else. And so did Natalie. As she recently decided to quit her job to pursue a career as a freelancer. What did you do? I took my job today. What? What did you do? It was terrifying. And if the place where things started to turn around. After all, the first video that ever took off on this channel was called My Minimalist apartment. I've grown as a filmmaker, a creative, and a human. I shared my story with you and over the past two years, I've got to hear many of yours. There you go, Matt. There he is. What's up, man? I'm going on, man. Right there. It's so weird to be here. Nice to meet you, man. You too. I recorded over 80 podcast episodes in this apartment. I couldn't afford a studio, so on an almost weekly basis, I would convert our dining room or dining area. It wasn't much of a room into a podcast studio. I wouldn't let myself come up with another excuse for why this could wait. This is the apartment where Natalie became a minimalist. Donating, minimalism. This is like, this is your second trip already, the go-well, right? Okay, perfect. Really? Look at you. I'm only kidding, she's still definitely not a minimalist. You love this, man. I shouldn't call you a bitch. But, we're being a bitch. Yes, please. It's amazing how much can happen in just two years. It's amazing what can change if you just continue to show up every day, give your time, and turn up for the people you care about. We made this apartment our home. All the times we made each other laugh, the fights we worked through, the shows we binge watched, food we shared, and weird things we did for no apparent reason. That's what made this place our home. And even though we're gaining something new by moving, it's hard not to feel like we're losing something we'll never get back. We're getting back to our home. Are you going to see that? No. Are you nervous? Yeah, I'm just going to see it. Okay. Ready, go. Yeah. Ready, go. Okay. Come on. Come on. Come on.
