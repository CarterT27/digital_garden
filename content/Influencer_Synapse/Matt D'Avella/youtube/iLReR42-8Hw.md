## Transcript
 I realized then that I was not in control, you know, like being a freelance artist is more about controlling yourself than getting work. It's so important to put boundaries and limits on yourself on both the positive and the negative. How often you go out for a drink with friends, how often you're spending money at on clothes or, you know, do you need to get a $2,000 couch where we'll have a $400 one work because there may not be much work coming up. Who knows? It's the future. You can't tell. So for me, it's also about controlling the emotional range and where I'm willing to let myself go, like in negative space, like how long am I going to linger on something that has happened. And, you know, to be honest, like every four months, there's like a thing. There's always a thing. Every time I meet you, I fall into a manhole. Yeah. I mean, 2016 alone, I had a car accident that was really bad. I had on September 11th coming to see you, my car was stolen with all my gear and then I fell into a manhole, like two weeks later, or whatever the hell that was. You know, I took on a nice apartment in a relationship with somebody and immediately ended the relationship and tripled my own rent somehow. You know, like, just, when you put it like that, all in one sentence. Yeah. It sounds like you're at rock bottom. But here's the thing. I found that rock bottoms not a bad place when you got friends there. So, you know, when I started to live in a rock bottom for a while, I've become like the kingpin of rock bottom, you know, because it's funny because, like, you have to just laugh at it. You literally have to fucking laugh at some of the things that go wrong in your life because if you don't, you're going to wall it with it.
