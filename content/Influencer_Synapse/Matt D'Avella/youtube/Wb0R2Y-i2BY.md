 did you know where you wanted to take that was it like I want to be an anchor like that's that's the dream I don't know how much I thought it through but yes I definitely was interested in being an anchor and when I got this opportunity where they so this was a local NBC station in Bangor main we did not have our own morning show because the morning show was done out of so the today show airs from 7 to 9 or actually now 7 to 11 on NBC stations throughout the country local stations usually do their own local news from 5 to 7 we were too small to have that 5 to 7 show so it was produced out of Portland which is a larger city to the south and we would air there morning show but we did do our own what are called cut-ins so when you're watching the today show or any major network morning show you'll see local news cut-ins where the local anchor comes on and does a couple of minutes of news weather and traffic and I was I got nobody wants to do that right I don't know but I because you had to get up before in the morning okay so I was given the opportunity to do that and I was like that's great I'll learn how to anchor and actually that changed my life so I would work these crazy days right have to be up at four come in right all of my own scripts do the cut-ins anchoring the cut-ins I have one blazer that was a handy down for my dad that's my only jacket I had and and then I would go report stories after that so I've worked these intense days I ended up making a reasonable amount of money because I had so much overtime for a young guy I think I made like 25 granders like that year in 1994 that was that's not a bad amount of money yeah and so yeah I just I took a calculator risk but it was so there's another seven years from when you first started until when you got to ABC yeah but a lot of things happened in there so I worked in Bangor for about a year then I was given an offer at age 23 to move to Portland Maine where I was the weekend anchor and I looked like I didn't even have a driver's license but they I was the weekend anchor on this big NBC station in Portland Maine and during the week I was a reporter and then and then I moved to Boston where I worked for sort of a local cable outlet I don't know if you you're from New York City right or Jersey City you know New York one which is or I'm sure I've seen it you know news 12 New Jersey I don't know I don't think I spent much time watching the local news so personally in lots of major metro areas they have a 24 hour local cable news and in Boston it's called NECN and New England cable news and so I worked for them and it was a great station and then after seven years of being a local news I got the call to go to ABC that's a long time I feel like over that time you probably built up a lot of confidence and was there a moment when or at least a year when you were like oh I got this like definitely not yeah no I did a like you've got it now right my worst moments are when I have that kind of confidence my best moments are when I'm worried but not so not so worried that I'm paralyzed so I find that I'm at my best when I'm a little bit uncertain and have what the Buddhists would call beginner's mind so I don't assume that I know everything and that allows for a certain amount of spontaneity but I make my worst mistakes when I'm like yeah I got this
