## Transcript
 Fear drives me a lot. My biggest fear is like waking up and I'm 80 and like, I didn't do anything in my life. Moving on to LA felt super natural to me, but a lot of my friends were like, you're not going to go to school. Like, what if you don't make it? I was always like, if I don't do this now, when am I ever going to do this? Like, when am I ever going to really try? Every day, all day, like, I don't care how scared I am. I have to do it because I'm afraid of waking up and saying, Oh, I could have. If I would have just tried a little bit, I could have. Even if I failed to doing it, that's fine. But I can't feel it because I didn't try. That's not okay with me.
