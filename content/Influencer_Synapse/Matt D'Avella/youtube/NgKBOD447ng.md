## Transcript
 The way I started out was I was out on the streets my iPhone 4, I didn't have a camera from the beginning, I started with the iPhone and I would go, I'm a product of the streets, my parents weren't really around when I was a kid and so I spent a lot of time on the streets, I met a lot of people on the streets, I still have a lot of friends from when I was younger that are on the streets still, a lot of them have passed away, a lot of them are in jail but when I first started I wanted to tell their stories, the people that I knew and I basically would go out, excuse me, take a photo of them and hear their story and kind of write it on Instagram and I feel like that's what kind of got my name out there initially and over the years kind of just evolved into just letting it the photo tell the story for the people, let them come up with their own story, what we just spoke about but I used to write paragraphs on some photos, on some photos of those photos of the people every Monday I would go out or every Monday I would post on Instagram, these stories and kind of let people read them and I don't know, it's something I feel like I want to get back into but I just haven't yet because there's a lot of hate on those two, it's like oh you're taking advantage of these people, this is for your own gain but if they really go and like look at the comments and likes on it it's way less than what I usually get so and also I feel it's important to tell those stories because they're not really told on an everyday basis and I was on the streets I was homeless so I kind of get where they're coming from so yeah you kind of think about the perception of what somebody, how somebody's going to take this what's the worst way that they can screw this and twist this and make it look and guess what my intentions are but at the end of the day man that's like impossible you can't control people's perception of your intentions, you only have to go with your gut and like if there's a story that you want to tell push it out there and I think as you you start to develop an audience they understand who you are and it's like each story builds on itself, these these stories are complicated and difficult to tell and you want to make sure that you're you're giving them due justice right and also that you're not taking advantage of the people like you said that you're your photographing yeah and I mean online I don't want people to think of me that way like I'm taking advantage of people and it's like I have a following now and some people do understand what I'm trying to do with it and a lot of people don't and I just don't want to be perceived that way by anybody because I don't try to take advantage of anyone you know I was like I said I was on the streets I know how it feels it's very lonely place and when you're homeless nobody wants to even look at you especially in LA like I've been other places where people take care of homeless like Canada it's like homeless is you're one of their own doesn't matter if you're homeless people buy something to eat all the time like you'll never go hungry in Canada and here you see the guys digging through trashes and and like stealing food and going to jail for stealing food because they're hungry because no one will give them money or other cases they'll spend it on drugs of course but I literally just had one of my first experiences of helping out with a homeless shelter over my I just turned 30 a couple days ago and my girlfriend thanks man like she gave me like the greatest present because we've always been talking about okay like we want to help out we want to contribute and then so she she found a place for us to to help out delivering food to the homeless like it was the day after my birthday and that was really my first experience and the thing that opened my eyes about the whole thing was that these are people that have their own quirks their own idiosyncrasies like some are incredibly polite and gentle and calm some are a little bit angry some obviously have some some problems in their lives yeah so but it's I'm like shit that's no different than my friends and my family and the people that I know yeah so it made it very real to me and I think we try to to disconnect and even me living in New York for five years you just get used to walking past homeless people and not acknowledging them or ignoring them we're saying sorry not today like I'm sorry I can't give you money today this that it becomes very challenging when you do when you are faced with it of course and I and I see that part and a lot of a lot of the reason for me putting that stuff out on Instagram when I first started and and I still kind of do put it out but it not with the stories was because of that reason it's just kind of like a raise awareness that these are people too and that that was that's like 80% of it and the other 20% was just wanting to tell their stories because they'll never be told.
