One year ago we decided to sell most of our stuff, give up our lease in Los Angeles and live a more flexible lifestyle. We werenâ€™t planning to be nomads in the traditional sense.

But we did want to split our time between Sydney and Philadelphia to be closer to our families, and we knew renting a long-term apartment probably wasnâ€™t realistic. So we decided to just take the leap and see where it took us. And thatâ€™s brought us here.

 So here's the thing we can explain it was the middle of a pandemic my favorite wasn't retrograde and I had a really badge from boli that week Mistakes were made One year ago we decided to sell most of our stuff give up our lease in Los Angeles and live a more flexible lifestyle We're selling that we're selling that donating donating donating Not in a million years We weren't planning to be no meds in the traditional sense But we did want to split our time between Sydney and Philadelphia to be closer to our families and we knew that renting a long-term apartment Probably wasn't realistic. You put pressure on yourself to kind of feel like you're moving forward in life and I like have to kind of work against that kind of pressure to remind myself that like I have a choice and actually there's real freedom to be found Perhaps in kind of like living Lidar and won a magic so we decided to just take the leap and see where it takes us and that took us here So I think when we initially set out to do this we knew that there were going to be a lot of unknowns This in a lot of ways was an experiment. We weren't sure how it was going to play out But I think we learned a lot so far Yeah, so in this video we want to talk about some of the challenges some of the unexpected things that we got into some of the mistakes that we made And also all the good things that we got out of this process and what life is going to look like going forward So let's get into it experiments experiments They're really expensive. Yeah, I think we knew that this was not going to be the most cost-effective approach to living You know to try to you know go to Sydney for a while and then go to Philly for a while and like not have Survive of her bean bees You know air bean bees are great for vacations I think they're trying to be seen as a as like long stay the facilitators But they're expensive. You know, we're still able to get like a discount for you know multi-month stays But it's certainly a lot pricier than renting Obviously the benefit of that is we didn't have to buy furniture when we were in Sydney We didn't have to buy plates and cups and bowls and forks and knives and you know a couch and a bed and a mattress like we didn't have to buy those things so that's great I think in the short term it made the most sense because we were just getting started out And we certainly didn't want to move to Sydney and then buy all the stuff and move into an apartment when we knew we were going to be leaving Well, we actually thought initially we were going to leave in three months We were up staying for nine months and so that actually worked out because we were just like all right It's the most convenient. It's the easiest to get started It's also the cheapest in the short term because we're not Spending thousands of dollars on all this new furniture, but then the cost add up because rent is essentially Double when you're living out of an Airbnb Yeah, I mean nine months is a long time to stay in an Airbnb which leaves us too At that's point our next mistake our next challenge We really love that experiment are uncomfortable Experiments are really uncomfortable As was that We were living like a quasi no mad life I think no mad is what actually look at us and laugh and be like that's not no mad Because because we had an Airbnb for nine months, and we weren't like living in hostels and like living in ten Yeah, we're boozy know that and maybe season all moments and so like it was uncomfortable for us and like we certainly could never do the like the back I mean that did the kind of the backpacking through Europe when she was younger But like we couldn't do that at our age now because we just wouldn't be happy or comfortable doing it And then just like living in an apartment that just wasn't big enough didn't meet meet our needs didn't have enough space I mean you guys know the amount of camera here that I have And so that's just like everywhere in like next to the living room in the kitchen lights are set up all the time on the daily I felt like I was like tripping on things walking into things almost getting my eye poked out by rods I will say never did get her eye poked out, so that's a win almost did You know like all of gonna take is one time Maybe blind and then that's gonna pop up in a video with an eye patch I almost like wish I did like almost wish I did Does that a spice just next time just gonna be like I told you so yeah I mean I saw you gonna be like say or actually I don't see I saw you thruster eye towards it Prevent it's really important to curate a home and think really intentionally about how you lay out your home The things that you bring into it and in this case we were just so limited I think if we were looking to rent an apartment we never would have gone with that one because it was too small for our needs Like you know if you're at home watching this right now if you look around you've put things exactly where they are and it might be Clean and tidy or it might be a complete mess But that's a space that you've curated to feel comfortable within and you know because it's an Airbnb It's not customized to you. It's actually meant to be Universal which really means it doesn't really suit anyone Um, so I think that you know, it's not it's not made for long-time comfort. Hey, not sorry to interrupt But do you mind if I quickly talk about my YouTube course because enrollment is only open for one more week And I just I really want to give people the details. Oh, no, fuck me. It's not like all having a conversation Great, so imagine if Nat wants to start her own YouTube channel. I don't But imagine if she did you might think that having the best camera T-shirt glasses and bini is going to help her make great videos, but no What Nat really needs is a roadmap and that's why I created master YouTube It's the steps tools and skills you need to start your channel create original videos that rise above the noise and Attract your first 1,000 true fans and beyond all in one place For the first time ever, I'm giving you an inside look at how I operate my channel my process when I create a video And everything I wish I'd known as a brand new creator if you've ever watched a YouTube video and said to yourself I want to do that, but I don't know how then click the link in the description to learn more about how to master YouTube and Roman is only going to be open for another week after I upload this video. So what do you think are you going to enroll in Master YouTube? Everybody's watching. This is a big moment No Well, what's a bell on the map So the world was a bell The most loaded question that we can be asked is what's your address? What's your zip code? What's your zip code? We have like what's your country for our banks? We've changed the zip code like four or five times in the past year Yes, and so we just like have honestly when I go to pay for something now and I have to put the zip code in I always get it wrong twice Yeah, I can't get projected like the world definitely wasn't set up for people that are living a And nomadic lifestyle so in Australia they have universal health care and Getting onto universal health care or me getting back on to work so I've been off it for a while since I've been living in the U.S Was impossible because I couldn't provide any of the evidence like what's your address in Australia or like a show a rent rental agreement or property that you own a Latter room utility employer employment contract and self-employed So like all these standard Documents that you know, you'd have to share to prove anything for admin We don't really have and we haven't had to get more thoughtful about like when we do get those like electric bills and utilities and stuff You have to hold on to a lot of that stuff because then you need to be able to prove to ensure that you have a qualified life event Like it gets really tricky and then you don't have that when you're living in the Navy We have a massive checklist for like every time we leave Sydney every time that we leave Philadelphia What are the things that we need to do and and check off and like the you know switching over our cell phone Provider and that stuff like it's really annoying and it takes weeks and weeks until you actually are feeling somewhat Comfortable very difficult very difficult. Yeah. Not very fun. No, we should have sold all our stuff You believe that I don't believe that not only thanks for asking I think that we made the right decision with selling most of our stuff It definitely made life easier. We did hold on to a lot of really important essentials and some of our favorite things in a storage locker I think if we could have gone back there were some there were definitely be some pieces of furniture like our Mattress that we had and other things that we would have held onto because I think it just took so much time as we're we're now coming back and And kind of getting more settled down realizing that oh it would have been great to have those things So we sold everything through like Facebook marketplace We got decent money for it from it and it's great because it's kind of offset the price that we would have had to pay to You know acquire this bed we're sitting on and you know this bedside table and the dresser That's behind the camera when we feel like we're great over some of the decisions that we made in terms of selling it getting rid of most of our stuff I think it comes down to one a little bit of guilt for the things that probably did end up in a landfill or we know we did because we had to throw it out because it just wouldn't go to a donation center The things that we donate and think oh did anybody actually end up getting use your value from it I think these are the things that every but there wasn't a lot but I but I still think that like these are the things that Everybody deals with when they're getting rid of stuff. It's like you're gonna feel a little bit of guilt And I think actually feeling a little bit of that is okay because it makes you be more thoughtful about the next purchase that you make Because you don't want to get by something or take something off somebody's hands if you're going to eventually just throw it out So we talked about the challenges. We talked about the things that were difficult and the mistakes that we made But there are also a lot of really good things that happened from this whole process. So let's get into those X Experiments bring you closer No, I was gonna say how long you would go That me doing it. Okay, experiment He's so shy Experiments bring you closer to family the entire reason that we did this was always to be closer with family and so when we were in Sydney for me That was my first time really getting a chance to experience Sydney in a way that felt like I was living there because we were Dispend more time with that family and friends who are now my family and friends was really really special And then it was difficult to to come back to the east coast of the US It was also Easy it's one of those things that it's always gonna be bitter sweet whenever we leave a place It's not a perfect situation by any stretch, but this is the best situation that we could possibly find it feels so good It feels so good and Like I love that it makes allows us for him for spontaneity as well So like even little things like our sister and little coming in without nephew and niece on Friday and to fill in She's like hey, I'm gonna be in town to regret lunch, but like yeah, like it's just like we haven't done things like that Like these are just little things that I think we all probably take for granted when you have your family and friends like readily around you But when you don't it's like you know, just the just a little pop-ins and like I hey What are you doing Fred and I it all like just popping in like it just feels so good? We're getting more and more comfortable being uncomfortable We're trying to find a way in this work where this will work for us this Experiment we're learning is iterative. So like you know as we learn things we change the way we design it We got to fill in and we started renting out Basically an Airbnb similar type situation in Sydney and we were just like oh this like it was all these things that we've already talked about in this video Just we were not comfortable and so we were like all right How can we make this work for us and then we like started looking around at apartments and we're like apartments are literally gonna be half the cost of this Short-term rental that we're staying in and so we decided that you know what let's just get an apartment We did not set out to you know settle down in any way or have an apartment here in Philadelphia But as we started to look into it as we started to do the numbers and look into our finances and think about the kind of life that we wanted to build We're like all right screw it. Let's let's just get an apartment. Let's get comfortable You know obviously we had to buy a lot of new furniture which was a bit of a pain in the butt our plan right now is to Maybe sublet this when we leave like rent it out if we can to somebody else and so then that way We can have an apartment here. We're not quite sure what we're gonna do when we get to Sydney We have to figure out a way that we can make Sydney just as comfortable as here you found it a lot easier to Embrace the fact that we're gonna be getting a lease here in Philly then I did because I knew we weren't gonna be here all the time And so there's something so concrete and certain and final about signing a lease or like buying a property It's like you expect to be there all the time We knew we signed this lease knowing that we weren't gonna be here all the time And I found that really Extravagan and I found that really like it just it was a pressure a lot of pressure and I like I And I'm to be honest. I still kind of struggle with it like But I realize that that is I think it's like society telling us what we're meant to do because like when I think about it Rationaly and I think about it like financially. I'm like war like If we are open to subletting it where we were staying which was the Sunday Airbnb was crazy expensive We know that going between LA and going between Sydney and Philly is like that feels so good That like we will invest in that in that kind of lifestyle design I'm so happy and content and I wouldn't have it any other way like I'm so glad we did what we did. Yeah Yeah, it's just like time. I think we've all went with the last you know two years that we've all had Irregardless of where you are in the world like time with loved ones is worth investing in and I think that's the decision we've just you know we've chosen and the path we've chosen and yes It's not the cheapest way to live and it's not the easiest way to live like there's a lot of Complications, but for us it is so worth it.
