Since releasing our documentary Minimalism I’ve gotten this question a lot:  How can you be a filmmaker & a minimalist?

On the surface this question might seem like it’s based on a misunderstanding of what minimalism is, but truthfully I think it just comes from filmmakers who are paralyzed with choices.

Companies and peer’s sell them on the gear that they absolutely need to have. Just like the average consumer they’ve become inundated with options. The underlying assumption: You need more stuff.

In this video I talk about my relationship with the "stuff" of the filmmaking world. What are the important questions you should be asking yourself before you go out and purchase the latest gadget or gear?

 I've gotten this question a lot. How can you possibly be a minimalist and a filmmaker at the same time? I think it comes from filmmakers who are paralyzed with choices. Companies and peers sell them on the gear that they absolutely need to have, just like the average consumer they've become inundated with options. The underlying assumption? You need more stuff. As a filmmaker, I've acquired a lot of stuff over the years. I've got lenses, tripods, cables, and batteries, cameras, and camera stabilizers. I've got mics and drones. The first hundred dollars I ever made as a filmmaker, I reinvested entirely back into my business. I bought a pair of headphones. It was a small investment, but it was the smartest decision I ever made. It wasn't the headphones that brought me success, but the idea of reinvesting and committing myself to this craft. So should you get a drone, a camera stabilizer slider, or any of the other cool gear that's sold to you? I think that's the wrong question to ask. They might be better to ask yourself, how can I get better? It might mean buying new equipment, but it might also mean taking a course or reading a book. Honestly to me, there's no better feeling than reviewing footage with a friend after a long shoot. As you scroll through the clips, you find maybe one, two takes, where you've just nailed it. Getting composition, everything is just on point. It's hard to describe that feeling, but that's what I live for. That's why I buy new gear. It's not because I want that new, cool thing. It's because I'm trying to make the best film I possibly can. So yes, the tool is important, just as pants are important. Find the right fit at the right price, but once you've got it, stop obsessing, put your pants on, and get to work.
