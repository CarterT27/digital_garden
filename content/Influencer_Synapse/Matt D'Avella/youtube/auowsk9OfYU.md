Have you ever bought something expecting it to significantly improve your life? For a short time it might. But eventually you get used to the thing - it becomes the new normal.

In this video I talk about hedonic adaption (or the hedonic treadmill) & how a rise in money or buying a new car won't bring long-lasting happiness.
