## Transcript
 I did Britney in 2009. I did Jonas Brothers in Demi Lavato in 2010 and I did Britney again in 2011. We did the movies around that same, the magic, my movies around that time. Then I hopped on Beavers tour in 2012 and 13 and then right after Beavers I went on to Rulo. And so that's Rulo and Jason Rulo's tour was like my end all peak of what I'm doing. I was like I started getting into this facade of like in the dance room I felt like I was the dude like in that industry I was like I'm the guy because I just was hopping on tour to tour to tour in the big tours to so then I just sort of drifted away into who I thought I was versus who I really who I really was. I like was losing myself because I had that validation from different stars or whatever and thinking that I'm this but I'm really not like I really just wanted to be an actor and chill and have like a humbled moment and finally like at the end of End of D'Rulo I just like I couldn't like I just I was gone too long I was losing myself I was doing all kinds of drugs I was like I was literally like rocks on my mind I had long hair I know his ring earrings and like I got a couple tattoos and I was just like I am this image versus I am who I am and that was like the peak like we left we left South Africa after doing a show and I just was like I got on the plane stumbling like high and drunk and I just couldn't like I was like I'm not anything who I am I'm not anything that my mom would be proud of I'm not any I literally felt like I'm not anything even though to some people I was the man you know what I mean like I'm presenting the wrong man.
