## Transcript
 Yeah, there's that thing called Temple of where if you use somebody else's music in it, generally you kind of become attached to that music that you originally use. When you watch a piece of video with a piece of one piece of music in it a hundred times, it's really hard to see it another way. I don't know, it's kind of like seeing the Fox search light logo come up or something and they just change the song. Imagine that and you'd be like, wait, that's not supposed to be. It's supposed to like go, you know, like it, you get used to it. Even if it's not right, you just get used to it. Check out this full podcast episode at matdivella.com slash zero 48. It's a fascinating discussion about music, passion, and creativity.
