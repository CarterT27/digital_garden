Thanks for watching thanks for listening and enjoy the episode. It's kind of interesting because the the entire minimalist movement, the simple living movement really started around 2010 maybe a little bit earlier and I want to say that in that same time there was kind of this massive growth in health and wellness and lifestyle design. All this stuff is just becoming very much talked about both on social media and just in mainstream media as well. When did you first start to think about lifestyle design and like creating the life that you wanted versus the life that maybe just happened to you? Yeah you know I would probably say until recently maybe about two or three years ago as when I finally kind of clicked I think you know the whole push from minimalism did happen. I would say maybe started back a little bit earlier than 2012 and 10 I think that it designed really impacted that the way that we were just doing furniture and design and clothing, design and living spaces and homes and that transferred over into this way of life and I think that one of the things that I've learned especially from a health standpoint is that it's very difficult to live minimally because there's just so much noise out there. So for me it was a process of you know trial and error cutting through all of the noise trying stuff out on my own and it's kind of like when you're a kid you kind of learn what not to touch by touching it and it's a painful process and I was grasping for everything that was shown to me. So if someone said oh this is the new diet let me go and try this. This is the new breakout food the numerical food let me go and try that and I was doing what what many people do so it wasn't until about three years ago where I it kind of clicked in my mind that individually I need to craft my own path and that our health and wellness we're on our own journeys and what works for somebody else may not necessarily work for me and that it's okay and I got okay with knowing that there's more than one way to arrive at a destination and I think that people tend not to do that when they think about health and wellness that it's got to be this way but the reality is again what worked for somebody else it may not work for you we have different genetic makeups we have different schedules we have different food preferences we even actually genetically taste food differently some foods don't don't like agree with this and so there can't be just a singular way to go ahead and do that it's kind of crazy because that's the exact opposite of how the media works and how trends and fads come about they just you know whether it's gluten free or vegan vegetarian any I mean I don't even know how to call those fads but there's definitely been fads in the past 10 years that just kind of take off intermittent fasting and it's so it's how do you know which ones work for you and which one don't is it just a huge game of trial and error it is it is you know oftentimes and and that's one of the most painful things that I think that people don't want to hear but they actually need to hear oftentimes you gotta know what what to touch by not well what not to touch by actually touching it that's how people found out that they actually do have a gluten allergy some people that there's a lot of things that people will say that okay what can eat this because it blots me well you're just eating too much but you don't know that you're eating too much until you actually begin to eat for your right you know portion size when you when you begin to eat less when you just for a time period began to counter calories I don't think that actually there were bent to counter calories for a lifetime I think that you need to in a sense because we all at some point have to become a lot more competent in the foods that we're putting into our bodies and you can't do that until you actually go through that process right and I think I think that's kind of something that a lot of people don't realize as well is that not every the way that you maybe build habits isn't the way that you'll continue to build them over time and sometimes it becomes easier if you're trying to wake up early say before six a.m. every day I've due to I tried and failed for my entire life to make a habit like that stick and it's something that I wanted to do versus what I needed to do when you need to wake up early you wake up early you got jogging go there's choice but when you want to wake up early it's much harder and I found that it's just the the process of building that habit has changed where maybe early on I would have to like put eight ten different things and line them up where all right I need to make sure I need to know exactly what I'm going to do I'm going to have my due to this I'm going to have my gym shorts and my shoes right next to the bed I'm going to have a glass of water and then you know now I don't really have to use all those things anymore just because it's kind of it's starts to hardwire in your brain and you know what works and what doesn't and you don't waste as much time absolutely it's routine to you it becomes comfortable it becomes a part of your lifestyle becomes normal to you and I think that's what you it really just goes back to that like what actually fits your lifestyle and I think that's what minimal living also is it's not you know trying to craft your lifestyle around a certain thing it's when you are most comfortable like at that state build around that I guess that's first talk just about how you really got into fitness when did that begin you weren't always this person that is in front of me right now yeah you know I um I got into fitness probably and seriously I started in 2009 and I was still overweight then but I was just basically trying to out train a poor diet that's something that everybody does you know at some point trying to lose weight and I got serious about fitness in the since that all right let me try to find out the different ways to lose weight the best ways to go and do it so I was doing a bunch of hit cardio I tried a lot of spin I was I was doing the weight training so that's when I just begin that process to kind of educate myself about different ways to challenge my body physically but it wasn't until I was doing that for about three hours a day and seeing no change in my body that the light bulb finally clicked and said okay well what else is going on is also my diet and that was the biggest key because it was much more so about what I was putting into my body so when I finally got that gem literally the weight just began to melt off my bones it just began to fall off me and that motivated me much more to dive further into fitness and so I was thinking like okay if I can get my diet right and I can see myself losing weight all right well what do I need to do now in order to feel more energized at the gem what do I do now so I can be much stronger and be more explosive at the gym and other things that I'm doing so it was around that time frame probably that took me about two years to learn so 2012 I was just coasting and I knew what I had to go and do so I was even doing things like all right well let me try to bulk up now and I had never done it before because that have always been trying to lose weight and I was fearful I was so fearful about going back to that person that I was before but I no longer had that fear because I knew the algorithm for my body I think changing your diet is probably one of the hardest things to do because we were I think in a lot of ways were addicted to these foods addicted to the sugar and and you can correct me if I'm wrong if that's the wrong word to use but it's so hard to break that habit and start eating healthy what steps work for you when you were starting to turn things around yeah man it was it was it was hell of hard to break that for me I'll tell you what not to do what I tried to do early on was first off the first mistake I did was I took one of the cookie cutter diets and I told myself all right Kevin you can just eat for fuel and not for taste and for some reason I I had really convinced myself of this that I was really going to be able to do this and I and I was going strong I would say I was better than most so I did it for about a good two weeks and then just one day I passed by this taco shot this taco stand that I usually go to and I was like let me just get just one bite let me just get one bite and downhill again it sent me right back down that spiral so so trying to lie to yourself and to avoid you know good flavor at the expense of trying to lose weight it's going to lead you down that path that you know that you're not just going to be successful like you will be back at square one and and healthy food also is not bland and boring so whatever you were trying to do this whole like eat for for for fuel and not for taste that's just not even correct period because healthy food shouldn't taste like a chore the second thing that I did I believe was I tried to do everything at once I tried to overhaul my diet all that one so I was trying to eat healthy at every single meal and I was scrutinizing everything that I was eating and making sure that it was healthy and is like a plus and I got burned out period I would be that person who you would see on social media who'd post like all right I got all my meal is done like for the week yeah and by Thursday or Friday man I would be the next stuff away I'd be putting either whole bunch of barbecue sauce on there there's nothing wrong with that but I was putting like cups of barbecue sauce on things just to go and get it down and that's just sugar you know it is still healthy food well not when it's drenched in sugar bro or not when you put cheese on there I was going a little crazy or like the cheese I would put on there sprinkling some of this and some of that so I stopped doing that and what I just did what really worked for me to start eating healthy was I just picked one meal I just started very very small and I gave myself a reward for that and I just said all right Kev we're just gonna start simply and you go to work every single day you barely eat breakfast so that's cool you know that's the routine but your lunch is where you spend a whole bunch of money and you go out of control so I just picked lunch every single day and I would just prep that one meal and that's what I did and when I got consistent with that one then I said all right I'm feeling a little bit better here let me try maybe breakfast or let me try my post workout meal and I gradually begin to make those changes um in terms of kicking the sugar habit man it's it's really tough especially when a lot of the foods that you eat are kind of high in sugar a lot of the package food so one thing that you can do is you can cut out a lot of the package and process foods in your diet and reach for real foods I started eating a lot more fruits and the craziest thing happened they were satisfying me and then the more competent that I got about different foods and about dieting I realized too that fats could be really helpful and I know that you know the media and we'll tell you you got to have a low fat diet isn't necessarily true there are a lot of healthy fats out there so I started to literally eat nuts and seeds and almond butter and peanut butter and have that with some fruit and my sugar cravings were getting lower and lower I was eating avocado and guacamole foods that I really like anyway um and this and the satiation you know that you get from eating a fatty meal actually helped to curb a lot of the sweet cravings I love what you did in terms of starting well I guess you try to do all this stuff at the same time it's like you know you watch I'm not your guru by Tony Robbins and then I'm like I'm so motivated and fired up I just want to change everything in my life but sometimes it's much easier to just build things one at a time and if you build one habit this month and then another habit the next month then over time you have this whole collection of habits and your life is totally different so like just by starting with your lunch just by doing one meal and then eventually that sticks and you said okay then I can step it up and in a lot of ways it just is like a domino effect this one thing will have these ripple effects throughout your life that it's kind of hard to see it from the outside because we get so anxious and we're not patient enough I mean I'm guilty of that because everybody wants to see those results because they want to see what that cover model body looks like and all that but it just really does take time and I like to tell people to build your confidence up and and once you do something you get excited and you start doing more and more of it and that is the compound that effect of healthy living and healthy eating that once you see that you can just do one thing and then it's working for you then you want to do more that's why I was joking around with somebody that's why you see so many life coaches on Instagram people that have lost like 10,000 all of a sudden they went and go and tell you what's going on the gurus now like you just lost 10,000 last month bro but you know what I'm excited for you but that is what healthy living can do it changes your entire perspective and it makes you feel that you can do more and you want more and you want to share that enthusiasm with others is that what happened with you and which started first because I know around 2012 is when you started your tumblr block it was called Fitman Cook right from the beginning so did that I guess yeah what happened first there and was there something about actually writing down your thoughts about health and wellness that helped you to stick these habits yeah it didn't start out like that per se it became that it started out as a way to not have to pay for personal training but it's just like there's an LA if you have if you're an actor you can go to the gym at a discount over real yeah yeah they asked me like are you on IMDB and I'm like not not as an actor like if you are you can get 50% off like this is crazy are you serious I didn't know that yeah what were you used that today when I went to the gym yeah okay I'm gonna do yeah I'm nothing there so what's okay so no it was a wait because some guy from Instagram was gonna charge me was close to maybe a thousand dollars a month just for a four week program so I'm thinking no Kevin you can't keep spending all this money because this is gonna be like your fourth trainer and you still look the exact same so I decided to start reading about nutrition start blogging about it and the idea was to crowdsource my diet I was gonna post every single meal that I was eating so people that were out there would say hey that looks good man but maybe you should try this or eat less of this and more of that etc etc so it was a way for me to get energy from the crowd and also I was accountable I was sharing my you know my my body and my workout and I was being you know vulnerable in a way so putting myself out there was a way to say all right Kevin you gotta stick to this now because if people see this vlog then they're gonna know that oh I thought you're trying to lose weight and you're eating this yeah I love it it's like a humble approach though too because a lot of people when they're starting to put stuff out online they're so afraid of the criticism and what people will say you were kind of like come at me like yeah you guys are gonna help me if you tell me what's wrong with my diet that's right man I was trying to gain the system and what and what I realized there are more people out there just like me just like you who just you really are into you know that you want to eat better but you don't want something that's bland and boring and that's how it became you know what it is today it just started people just beginning to follow me and ask me questions and I was shared and then the more that they shared back with me the more enthusiasm again that I got and the more that I wanted to share and keep on sharing and then it just kind of there was that tipping point you know tipping point was every day I was and I had been doing this for months already I would go for a jog in the morning time and I would come back home and I would make this banana split and banana split was just a banana what some Greek yogurt some granola some berries and they were this was all measured out and about like a teaspoon of cacao nibs and one day I posted it on tumblr posted it to Instagram and the picture went viral and I was like oh my god this is the best thing ever I'm like really already been doing this but okay and it went viral and people just begin to follow me and and by November 30th I had about 10,000 followers and when that photo went viral by January I had a hundred thousand and it just began just to grow and grow and grow. What advice would you give to creators that are trying to like you did break through the noise is there a secret formula or is it just keep going just keep you know keep it up the consistency is is everything yeah man you hit it consistency is everything and I do kind of feel it's more it's more challenging now I would say just starting out if you're trying to grow like a really large following because it's saturated we're not you know when I was doing it back in 2012 there were some people out there that were doing it but it wasn't as saturated as it is now and just like with everything else you know when people see that something is really popular you know that it becomes a business and so people have just even companies are just flooding all this information and all this noise to you so the best thing that a creator can do right now to rise above that noise is first off you got to be consistent second of all have a point of view about something and I'm not here's my rant my rant about some of the social media people out there today and I hope this comes off the right way it's fine to have a point of view but you shouldn't have to you know crap on somebody else just to make your point it doesn't and it sounds good and you may get a lot of likes you may get people saying yeah that's true yeah that's good that's good that's good but that doesn't really translate into anything it doesn't really translate into influence so if you really want to separate yourself from anybody else just be different and be consistent focus on the quality of the content and what you're putting out there and the people that I've seen who break through are people that aren't afraid to your point you can't be afraid to put yourself out there and to be criticized so if you have a viewpoint stay in firmly in your viewpoint and don't waver also I see a lot of trainers who try to break through and fitness or they want to break through and fitness but they don't but they what they do safe things and what I mean with safe is oh I'm going to show you how to do the correct form of squat perfect I love that type of content you know but sometimes you got to push the needle just a little bit further and I'm not saying that you should be squatting on top of a skateboard or doing a back flip and then squat and then a bench press just for just for some likes in the video but there's but but you've got to push needle just be a lot more thoughtful you know that that that video is out there so if you're squat video so if you want to do a squat video then it best then it should be like the best darn squat video there's got to be something different about it and I think that some people are like well I'm not growing up that quality content all the time well you do so continue to do that but also think about your compelling proposition is for people to want to follow you even more integrity is really important and it's something that once you lose it it's very hard to get back so if you start it by like shitting on people and if you said being somebody that's not pleasant then it's very hard to regain that and you know also like you have to see it as a community too and I'm sure that you've seen this as well is that the more you get into it the more you create the more you're collaborating and you just meet these other people who are going through the very same things that you are and no matter whether it's the Gary V who has millions and millions of followers or if somebody has got 10,000 followers I think we should just really be trying to treat everybody with respect and try to learn from each other spot on how he'll agree to that has there been in terms of like collaborating with other people that's something that's helped you as you develop as a creator yourself yeah it has but not it and that's much more so like recently you know I didn't do as many collapse first off because I've been tucked away in Texas and Dallas and so there aren't that many creators out there and so when I got the chance to do it I think that it's always been super helpful also and this is just the way that I was this is my own like creative flow and something that I've done even throughout high school and college doing group projects but I like to have my own ideas per se for something and I want to be able to put it together without the influence of other people that's the way that I've always written my papers my projects anything that I've turned in that isn't it's not always the case it's not and that's not always the best thing to do here with like podcasting or blogging but I think that it is helpful because it helps me to be it helps me to know like what I want like when you can see something in your mind and go and do it so but in terms of collaborating I think it's a brilliant idea to go ahead and do that make sure that your content can stand alone and that you can stand alone that you have that type of brand personality that people can identify separate from the collab but it's absolutely a worthwhile thing to do. I think Seth Gauden said that too it's that you you want to be able to be the presence that people go to see so people listen to your podcast for you they read your blog for you not the people who are contributing to your blog and helping to write it so it's and that's I mean it's something that's that's hard early on to really grasp because a lot of times when you're trying to collaborate you're just trying to get favors from people right could you please like you know come on my show whatever and then because it's going to help the get or the host more than it will help the guests and like I think that's just one of those parts too or it's just eventually that scale tips and that's one way to get heard in the beginning but it's definitely I think you you hit it when you just said that you have to just focus on your personality and what you can bring to the table and if it doesn't feel like you can bring something different you just have to try. Yeah my son is going to pick it till you make it. Yeah we're developing that fake it sometimes yeah I don't know I'm gonna figure this out right now live back to the health and wellness yeah a lot of people will say I don't have enough time right I don't have enough time but you healthy I don't have enough time to go to the gym personal trainer whatever what would you say to that you don't and you're never having enough time for anything to be quite honest I didn't have enough time but I had to make time but you have enough time to do things that you actually want to do and the reality is you've got to stop we've got to stop looking at your health and wellness as like the icing on the cake or like the cherry on top your health and wellness is actually the batter you can't do what you do well or at the highest level if you are not physically mentally holistically well so you've got to look at your health and wellness much more so as an investment into your future and that means if you want to even start up your own business if you're trying to get married if you want to do something physically of course but health and wellness extends to every aspect of our lives and so it's foolish and shameful to say that you don't have time for it and there are people out there that have these crazy hectic schedules agree with you and I've seen that and I've been there before so what your challenges is to find the incremental ways that you could actually incorporate health and wellness into your life first off we always have time to make a better health decision whenever it comes to what we're putting into our bodies we all time for that and let me just just give you some of the best news ever you can lose all the way that you want if you just eat right you don't even have to go to the gym you don't even have to my dad is 66, 67 years old and he had a whole bunch of health issues extremely overweight he was about 250 maybe 260 no he was 250 and he had so much inflammation in his body he had bursitis he had six hip operations couple shoulder surgeries as well so his mobility is super limited and he was still just eating and gaining a whole bunch of weight and I said okay part of the reason why you're feeling inflamed inside your body is your diet is really bad so I normally would not say this to other people but I said I think that you should actually go vegan to reduce the inflammation and he was at a point in his life to say okay I'm gonna listen to you he did that he lost 50 pounds just by eating better and it wasn't he's not eating rabbit food he's eating whole some nutritious very filling substance to food but he's nourishing his body in a way so he wasn't fatigued he he wasn't tired he he wasn't walking around feeling hungry he was full but the weight began to fall off him and I like it and I like to share his story because he can't physically get up and walk around the neighborhood it's just not there and it proves the point that it's about 80% diet and 20% working out so even for the person who doesn't have any time in the world to get to a gym I'm gonna tell you you don't have to go to the gym but you do have time to eat right we all have time for that incrementally fine ways to be much more active you can walk around the neighborhood you can take I've done the stairs before I take a jump rope with me because I used to do consulting and I started to gain a whole bunch of weight I was doing that and I would take a jump rope with me to do things like that so you can find the incremental ways that you can add a little bit more activity to your life but everyone always has time to eat better when you're traveling and say like your routine is a little bit broken when you're not at home do things tend to fall off a little bit for you or do you are you pretty strict with maintaining the similar choices and I'm also curious because early on it sounded like you you were you know just weighing every gram of protein that came into your body has that changed a little bit like do you do like indulge and go out and eat or drink or kind of let loose and let that stuff go a bit yeah you know my entire life still actually even at home reflects what I do when I travel of course when I travel I don't have the comfort of my own home so I can't go and cook for myself because I prefer to cook first stuff is just much cheaper secondly I know what I'm putting into my body and I can't just have with somewhat of a routine there but the reality is the way that live my life at home is the way that I live my life as I travel I just make better choices and I do indulge every once in a while I just don't do it every single day and when I want to get strict and I want to lose a couple pounds or when I want to tone up and go and do that I know that algorithm for my body so I can become a lot more strict and disciplined with my workouts and with my eating habits but I have adopted a much more intuitive approach to eating which is probably the most minimal thing that you can do because it doesn't focus on what the you know that a particular type of diet it doesn't focus on what you shouldn't be eating it's all about being in tune with your body and listening to your body so it's about saying mmm this food did not agree with me don't eat that again or hey Kevin you know you're full so stop eating drink some water okay I'm not hungry anymore so this is like the matrix level where you start seeing the code here what it is it is but we all have the capability and it's and it's the way that we should be living our lives yeah we should live our lives very very freely just to eat eat the things that we want that you can actually eat medically genetically you know that are good for you and enjoying the different types of cuisines without the added anxiety and stress of having to feel the need to wait every gram of protein I gotta count my calories every single time now in the very beginning if you're starting out I think that is very helpful and I think that we all should do that because you need to become again competent about foods and what you're putting into your body you just have to do that and I wish that maybe as kids we had that type of education we had like the food pyramid and things like that but we really didn't we really weren't taught how to eat and how to put foods together at least I wasn't so everybody at some point needs to go through that process and after you see the way your body reacts to you counting calories and being measured then you know what go and do what you want to do now you have the information so that you can begin to make informed decisions it's about again listening to your body you know as a child you know parents would say clean that plate clean that plate and you need to be full you put a clean that plate so we're taught at a young age to stop listening to our bodies and listen to the person telling us or no you know we're told to listen and look at that plate and looking at a plate of food is a judge of whether or not we are hungry or not my parents wouldn't let me leave the dining room table until my food was cleared and I never ate it it was just be like an hour two hours of me just looking at this cold food and it was like it was like green beans out of like frozen green beans I was like I honestly didn't know produce came fresh I was that thought everything was kind of frozen my mom's to kill me she's not gonna like that she listens to the podcast right here hey mom but um now it's I think it's funny because this is the advice that people really don't want to hear because I think people love rules yeah and they love steps and I think like you said it can help you get started but and it can give you at least some points to get into it but I think the day we're so individual and so unique that it's it's impossible to say here take this advice and then go run with it um like implement you know this diet into your life because it depends where you're at right now depends how your body processes these foods I got a funny story about that actually so I recently did this DNA test and the DNA test you did yeah the 23 I didn't actually do the food thing but it's did the the heritage one okay well you gotta do it yeah so I think that if you send that data on to another company they can actually pull that stuff for you yeah so it basically tells you all of your predispositions there's no predispositions but the your your proclivity I think to maybe get a certain disease or and you're preferably like you know 10% more likely to get Alzheimer's or something like that or you know or like heart disease or it also talks about your your food preferences as a child my parents would make me I was that kid at the table crying like tears in my face saying don't make me the muscles bros I hate them I hate them I hate them like literally I was saying and put me eat that stuff right now that I'm like Lama beans so I took this test recently and the test said you have a really strong bitter taste sensitivity and it said you probably hate foods like brosal sprouts and I died I died I went right back to that moment as a child I come and I just like see you're torturing me in the child so to your point we are all different you know and in the way that we taste and experience food is different so it's not it's not helpful for us to tell people you gotta try this diet I'm only going to tell you to try it to see if you actually like it and you can adapt it to your lifestyle but we are so unique you know individually so it's helpful for us to it's it's a much better approach just to eat what works for you eat what agrees with your body if you don't like kale the stop eating kale there are tons of other greens up there that you can go and choose from I don't like rice well then don't eat rice bro there is keen one there's bottle those vulgar there's a whole bunch of stuff that's out there so we've got to break this idea that you can only eat certain things in order to be healthy I think it probably takes a lot of experimentation just a lot of trying different things and seeing what sticks and what works and what doesn't right but that's the fun part though you know it really is one thing that actually brought me a lot of good joy and this is when I started to say just really get into healthy cooking and I could see myself you know changing my body is that I would give myself one food each week to research and find a recipe for and I didn't know that stuff was honestly didn't you know I grew up in the self and Texas and I only knew rice and I remember when I walked into the store I was feeling I was feeling myself too I went up to Ghana say hey I made you tell me work and find the quinoa and he says I think you mean quinoa and I was like no it's quinoa ass and then I started movement yeah and it sounds better it's been as a way it's fell and the only someone next to told me I was like he was right but it was that type of enthusiasm again just that trial and error of introducing like brand new foods and seeing how I could adapt it to me and my preference is even to my culture I even made a dirty quinoa like a dirty rice dish but it was dirty quinoa instead and so I got a lot of you know just enjoyment out of trying new foods so that's actually the good fun part of this journey well I love how open you are too just about how little you knew early on because a lot of times we see the person as they are today you see the rock as he is today and then you just completely forget that they had all these steps that they weren't always that person that it took a lot of time and energy and work to get to that point to where they are oh absolutely um did you in terms of building what you have now I know you got a book that just came out imagine it takes a lot of sacrifice to make all those things work yeah it did it that that book was a labor of love but I wanted to write a book for so long but I'm glad that I wrote it down at this point I technically wrote it about two years ago it's coming out now but I used I had so many test cases like actually the fitment community really helped to write this book because now using all of their messages and their emails and seeing the way that they responded to certain recipes and their questions about meal prep about healthy eating I was able to really capture in this book giving people a roadmap to healthy eating because I didn't want someone to feel the way that I did like standing in the grocery store walking around the house like is he going to steal something he gone by something like I was that guy I didn't know what to do and in this book I basically kind of like hey let me take your hand and walk you through how to get started and then here's some recipes to try to I mean that's the hardest part right yeah yeah because you don't know like where to where like to begin and that's why I try to tell people even today it's like just start small just start small just and I think that we discounted that because we want the instant results and we want to look like that magazine model or that fitness person you know that that like celebrity but you've got to start somewhere and when you start small I guarantee you that you're going to feel so good about yourself it's going to energize you for the road ahead as opposed to doing everything at once getting burned out and quitting and that's the the the path that I think I think it's the path that inevitably all of us will take I think it's probably good to know that you're going to fail but maybe not this time right because all it takes is one time for it to work that's right if you just take it one day at a time yeah if you just take it slow and I think maybe map out a course um that's probably the way to go because inevitably life's going to get in the way and you just need to be prepared for when you have those bumpy roads and when you have times where you're traveling or you're going home you know it's going to be a little bit harder to get your uh keen one right I was trying to figure out how you even pronounce it I was going to say no and it was going to be a great callback but I forgot to turn it out I forgot you know I pronounced it in in terms of like those experiments that you've done I know one of them specifically is the meal prep you've talked quite a bit about it and I know that you like you said had some failed trials in that as well is that something you do now is it something you recommend for people because it's it's appealing it looks amazing on an Instagram photo okay I've dried it before and it just for me it was like it was kind of too bland and maybe that's just me like I just doing the approach wrong yeah but I find that meal prep it looks amazing it's harder for me to execute and practice right well what you're actually looking at is on the Instagram and the photos that do very well you're looking like a week worth of food and in my approach like what I said before just do one if you bring your lunch to a work that's meal prep it's not seven days a week you know it could just be three days so just start doing that one thing very well and build your confidence that's what I'm trying to say and in terms of it being bland well I'm not sure about just gives him the kitchen so I gotta see what you're cooking up first enough for me to judge that I mean hopefully you know you were putting some type of sauce on it or something right every time would you make now I do I'm like every when you were talking about just like the the fact that you were just eating food for just sustenance the fuel I was like doing that's me oh well you can do that then it's good yeah yeah I can do it and I'm I'm okay with it um I don't know yeah I don't need all the sauces I know my partner Natalie she she loves sauces yeah I mean she's Asian and she's got the entire wall cabinet is all these different Asian sauces I had never seen before it's right like for every kind of dumpling every I was like what are you doing and then I just kind of opened up my eyes to it I don't really need to be drenched in in uh sauces she will literally if I make steak she'll like this she's gonna get mad at me but she'll like lick the pan dry for 10 out for like an hour or two and like that's disgusting what that's the width of all the flavor is broken that's like caramelized they're in that skillet and I've done that before she's done it shout out to you she knows that good flavor is broke you get a chase the flavor chase the flavor yeah but you know flavor though right you grew up with some flavor in your house I you know what I think I'm starting to know I actually didn't really grow with my mom is listening to this podcast for a bit of a lie right now upset there was a lot of student listen we had we were all of garden Italian we had like spaghetti and butter spaghetti and ketchup like it wasn't glant I know gosh I know it was never has spaghetti and ketchup um no yeah you shouldn't it's not a thing I would recommend no it's all right it's whatever it's good but uh we weren't or and we we I didn't even know what both nays was I never heard the word before I just we called a meat sauce meat sauce it was a jersey um but I get did your parents like make really good food grown yeah good Southern cooking and then I lived in Texas too so we had Mexican food so if it wasn't so food Sunday it was gonna be Mexican food that I was eating so I grew up with the whole lot of flavor in my life well maybe that's like why like you got kind of big early on and then I stayed scrawny for my time early when I kept trying to gain weight because all of you was spaghetti and ketchup oh well that should put some weight on you bro I'm spaghetti why also are you a hard gainer uh what it was what is a hard game a hard gainer is someone who is a difficult time gaining weight I what I mean I was it took me and through college so probably like 20 years before I was ever able to I mean obviously I wasn't trying it one year old but yeah I mean through my whole life through high school through college I tried to put on weight and it took me a long time to get it but then once I broke through with the help of protein shakes and just just like in the help oh yes you're definitely a like hard gainer because I can look at food and gain weight oh yeah I can look at a pizza and be like just got them calories there we go I'm gonna go for the next hour I feel bad I feel bad because people I don't people give a hard time to the the people that have a difficult time gaining weight because it's kind of like it's not a very common problem I don't think but I think there are more people out there than than you might imagine that are quite a bit yeah I get quite a bit of emails from guys and women who asked me about how to gain weight and it's it was a foreign concept to me yeah really was until I started to work on some meal plans for people and I would really try and I would just just boost the calories doing pastas doing nuts and um and potatoes and they would still not gain weight and I'm like Jesus how are you are eating 4,000 calories and you were 140 pounds how in the world are you not larger so yeah I mean it's a it's a good challenge to have it is I mean you actually do just have to eat probably an unhealthy amount of food in the beginning to like break through but you just have to stuff your stomach I just say like whatever I was eating I just doubled it eight twice as much food if I would have a tuna fish sandwich I would just make two and I would do that for almost every meal in the beginning and then it's what interesting because I think you do kind of in the same way we're talking about building habits yeah you kind of break through to a certain point and maybe your stomach gives it a little bit larger you kind of it becomes easier and it's more maintenance you know your maintaining versus trying to drive to a certain place yeah yeah I did 30 days vegan okay because I have rich role in the podcast okay and I was like all right let me let me try to do this 30 day vegan thing mm-hmm I don't really like it this is not made and that's in that's your story bro and no and there's nothing wrong with that do you know people think that just because I told my past ago vegan and they did and we're successful that I'm going to go vegan and absolutely not I don't think it's for me but I imagine you get a lot of people saying when you're going to go vegan you're going to go vegan no you don't get anybody maybe that's all right yeah people always ask me that and the answer is no I don't think that I need to be I have become a lot more plant dominant meaning I prioritize plants over animal products because I think that's actually helpful and I've seen a difference in how I feel and how I perform eating a lot more plants and and we've got a vegan is not just salads it's it's grains it's like legumes it's nuts and seeds it's oils it's all those different things right now I've seen a lot of overweight vegans because their foods oftentimes are really calorie dense like super calorie dense because they're trying to recreate a lot of flavors that you get from meat and the textures too and when you start packing those things in like for instance if you like the nacho cheese dip people love that cashews you're just eating nuts brode of that's not I'm not sure you're just eating oh bunch of nuts right but in the that's high in calories it's a super high in calories so yeah just because you vegan bro doesn't mean that you're going to be super slim just saying that's great you want to wrap up the podcast with a couple quick questions here the quick question is not quick answer so feel free to to kind of stretch out and elaborate on them if you want if you could go back to say around 20 years old or so what would you do differently what advice would you give a younger version of yourself um the advice that I would give myself at that point would out two things I'd probably tell myself to go back and take that nutrition course that I skipped that on in college because I just knew so little about food and it was a course that I could have taken what I just chose not to I think that would have really helped me out tremendously and then I would I'd probably tell myself to yeah I'd probably tell myself to do that to become to to start that process to become educated about foods and I always say that because after I graduate is when I went to consulting and I started all that traveling and gained a whole bunch away and I was miserable so had I known I didn't know anything about food meant literally I do nothing about food when I say nothing I mean nothing I think somebody mentioned a rougler in a in a in a conversation to me and I had to play along and I was like oh yeah yeah yeah like what the hell is that I had no idea so I would have I would have liked to have known just a little bit more about food and to experiment some and the second thing you know that I would have done that's probably would have like I don't need sure how to even do this but at a young age build up my emotional EQ is that what it's called your EQ IQ emotional IQ oh you okay it's called the EQ but it's emotional intelligence got it I'm getting much more in tune with with my feelings and how to express them in a much better way because I think that I used a lot of times food and alcohol to you know to like an exercise pain to deal with some of my emotions this will a lot of people do let me go and need this primer ice cream let me go and eat these cookies and I would do that consistently I didn't know how to deal with those emotions as a young person growing up so I'd not work on my mental health too that's really interesting it really is an emotional relationship isn't it it's mostly mental yeah absolutely you know one thing that I'm going to be kick right now is mental wellness and it's something that I haven't shared too much of just because it's been so personal to me and to be quite honest man I just didn't think I had the strength enough to go ahead and do that to put myself out there and to really talk about it but it's a place where I feel like it's been lacking because it's such a fundamental part of our of our wellness that not talking about it does a huge disservice oftentimes the things that we do what we eat will be put into our bodies how we feel about ourselves goes back to the different thoughts that are in our head the different lies it would maybe that we've been told or we were telling ourselves or when things happen how we deal with the emotions so I definitely want to encourage people to become mentally well and and part of that process is talking about and articulating some of the things that you're feeling this is making you weak actually to talk about these type of things I've learned that too actually makes you super strong actually makes you and it makes you a much more creative person I feel like too because then you're able to take all of that bottle of energy and put it into something productive some of the best work is come out of people who have later on said after go with mental health and mental wellness issues Michael Phelps you know he's one of his one of the greatest Olympians greatest athletes ever and now he's opening up and talking about like a lot of his battles and wow how can you accomplish all that and I just imagine I'm speaking for him right in a sense but I just imagine that part of his part of his wellness routine was swimming and being able to express himself in that way the energy you know that he just couldn't put like elsewhere so I think it's important yeah and a lot of people think that the struggles stop when you have certain amount of success when you get to a certain place if you have a certain amount of followers or income or revenue whatever it is you think okay that's it and their life is going to be made but it really a lot of times it just leads to bigger problems and the maybe even the mental health issues get amplified because of all that stuff because you're like I mean how many celebrities does it take to attempt it or commit suicide and it's it's every time you hear about it you're like holy shit like and it's a reminder in a wake up call that you think they have everything but it doesn't take all the stuff all that external stuff to be happy like you can say can do that right from the beginning absolutely what's the simplest advice that's the most important to follow can I give two pieces yeah first one I start small second one is do you start small don't try to do everything at once I'll say it until the day I die don't try to go out and make an Instagram photo and prepping all this food or just doing anything we try to get to the end goal too fast start small there is a lot of benefit in doing that you gain momentum that way you you can encourage yourself that way you notice mistakes that way and you build a really strong foundation so start small with whatever you do and then the second thing is do you and this social media age is so easy to look to the person to the left and write of us and see what they're doing see what they're eating and try to hop on board with them but you're different and you're running your own race so I like to tell people to stay on their own damn plate don't worry about what I'm eating you worry about you and your play and what's working for you and your diet so I guess in a lot of ways what you're kind of how do you see the content that you produce is mostly like suggestions like maybe try this maybe bring this into your life like you can do I mean you put out a lot of stuff you put out a lot of amazing videos and a lot of amazing content and I it'd be very hard to make all that stuff I think impossible to make all that stuff in anybody's life so was that it is it are these suggestions absolutely I turned on to be too prescriptive and what I'm doing even now I always go back to what I was doing before so I can remind myself of how I started but this is just a continuation of my own health and wellness journey my cooking's changed my you know my techniques have changed but it's still my journey hey guys try this recipe it was great I liked it you may like it too if you want to try it here's a recipe here are the macros instead of you got to try this recipe because this this how you get these abs hmm when you promise things like that it just it it puts a different spin on it and I told myself because I was this guy man when I was like overweight I was doing everything like literally everything I was going into this supplement shop to the vitamin shop type of store and my bill there every month was about 300 bucks a month because I was buying every single fat burner pre workout protein vitamin supplement pro hormone thing you name it I had it if I pissed in a cup you'd probably eat the cup because I didn't know better and so I took and I was trying to look like the person that was on the bottle on the thing and there's people saying oh you got to take this man you got to take this but I was taking everything and putting that all into my body so I told myself if I ever got the opportunity I would not use my platform that way I would not try to go and promise people instant results or instant things you got to do this to get that because it's actually false we're all different and what works for me it may not work for you but I want you to try it out so you can find out again going back to what I said what not to touch if it's not for you that's I mean that's amazing that you're doing that just because there's so many people in the the health and wellness industry who try to push and and I see it on YouTube all the time false promises and clickbait titles just to rope somebody in and to me a lot of times it's the you need this like all caps trying to sell a camera trying to boost their affiliate links and there is you don't have to do that you don't have to go down that route you don't have to make people feel like they're missing out on something or like if they don't make this one change in our life then they're going to be a complete failure so I appreciate what you're doing it's it's really thank you awesome just a couple more questions is there in terms of because we talked a lot about creating and being creative and making stuff as well as the health and fitness but in terms of the creator side of things is there a universal skill is there maybe something that stands out to you that every creator should learn and now I know this goes contrary to our advice of giving blanket advice but I think that there may be a few things in there that whether it's something that's metaphor metaphorical or if it's just like actual practical skill like writing is there something that stands out to you yeah I've seen it's not necessarily a skill but it's a trait I'd say curiosity I think that to be a good creator you need to be curious about things you need to always be asking like what if or how could this be true could I do this could I do that it keeps you personally engaged it keeps you personally committed to something it keeps you it keeps your interest most creatives that I know they they can lose interest pretty quickly in something and I think it's the it's the curiosity about life and the various aspects of it that really just kind of draws us in that you know it keeps us wanting to create something now saying that there is a fine line to that because I'm gonna ask you to go on to Instagram and again start squatting on top of skateboards and doing backflips and everything else you know you're going to do that and that's cool that that's what you want to go and do and do it safely yeah you could do it safely because there are some people who actually can do that safely and they should be able to go and do that so I'm not saying that you've got to be that curious that you're trying to you know do something but you know it's it's you know for me with the curiosity it looks like was man I just was out and I had the most amazing pizza like ever it was the best Mediterranean pizza I've ever had in my entire life it was it was unhealthy as I don't know what is but four dozen calories the curiosity in me says you know what how can I create the same flavor but at 60% less calories and how could I put that how could I also make this pretty accessible to the world by not blowing up the budget for it so it's those types of things those types of questions that kind of get me going and they get me excited about what I do because I make a whole lot of stuff that people don't see they just doesn't work out and I was like I can't share this you know at all but that curiosity still drives me like I have a recipe right now that's actually failing in my freezer it's ever got to throw it out before I came to LA but it drives us yeah and I think that's that's a fear too is that you just maybe we'll run out of ideas but if you constantly say curious and you're you're pushing yourself there is there's a thousand different ways a million different ways to tell the same story so you put your own unique spin on it and sometimes that's what makes the difference yeah so I'm sure you faced a lot of doubt in your days both as a creator and as somebody trying to get fit how do you approach doubt these days and how have you managed to work through it yeah it's that's so much doubt I still have doubt today I struggle with that all the time and I think that doubt is a really good thing because it keeps you on your toes also is a reminder that you're alive and that you're human to be quite honest if you're not feeling doubtful then I'd say that maybe you should be a little bit worried just because you want to be kept on your toes because you want to be on the next cutting edge of something or like whatever you're doing in your craft the best way to deal with doubt oftentimes in in my case is just to do it afraid and that's not the easiest advice to you know to to take but it's the best advice I can give to somebody that my pastor once said sometimes you've got a you've got a you've got a trust in Trimble at the same time and I liked the way he said that because oftentimes that we've been taught you've got to be fearless and going there and do that and we see the movies of you know these big warriors but I like what he said then I look at the movie 300 this one my favorite movies like I just love everything about it and then going into battle and knowing that you know we are probably going to die and still there was that one person that was kind of afraid there and I'm like hey we're going to do this anyway so sometimes you have to stand up to life and that's and that's how that's how you do with it and that's that's more like the fear of doubt thing when you have doubt with something else that you're maybe doing you know I think it's good just to kind of figure out why or that's coming from and that takes being in tune again with the whole mental health thing with your emotions and your feelings to kind of get to the root of that because oftentimes that could be a good signal and a good trigger for you not to proceed down a certain path if you're having doubt about it with me for business you know if I'm feeling crazy about a certain business deal and just don't do it period and there could be a whole lot of money on the table there could be a good opportunity but if I don't like it and I'm known for this maybe behind the scenes if I don't like it if I don't vibe with it if it's not not sure that I don't do it that's different from oh my god it's gonna freak me out I'm not to be doing this and for all these people that type of doubts different so you've got to be in tune enough with you and your emotions in order to distinguish which one it is. It's so important that's Derek Sivers calls it it's either hell yes or no it's not something that you're like 100% all in for so good and you know we make these mistakes early on because you make mistakes and you say the pretty yeah no that sounds pretty good and then you do that project and you're like wow this is taken way longer than I thought it was gonna take and it takes sometimes learning those mistakes the hard way but and I think obviously I think early on when you're first starting out it's a little bit different and the early on when you have no opportunities you kind of have to say yes to everything to go to the point where you can start saying no but I think that that's awesome advice for creators who are facing doubt yeah so to wrap up the podcast by the way I just gonna say that's the nice coaster I just realized most expensive coaster I've ever seen yeah I phone coaster the I phone coaster yeah that's great so if people want to find the book if they want to find more about you where should we send them yeah they can go to fitmentcooked.com together recipes they can follow me anywhere at fitmentcooked Instagram is my is my primary channel but also YouTube and Facebook at fitmentcooked and then the book is sold wherever books are sold so Amazon, Barnes and Nobles I think they know the place in Canada I forget the name of it but yeah but you can get thought out from it from from fitmentcooked.com and the book's called fitmentcooked they make it nice and simple make it easy and it's for women too great so I don't people know that it's it's for it's a hundred plus recipes for men and women so women can benefit from this too in fact women are like my primary supporters because they are tagging people tagging the boyfriends to girl friends and we're gonna make this on Friday night.
