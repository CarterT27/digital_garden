## Transcript
 All right, so this is a video about a weird little thing I made, but really it's about why we need to start looking at the big picture. far too often we get swept up, swept up in our jobs, in the rat race, in current events. We're pulled by the tide of our current obsession and we often overlook what's truly important. That's one of the things that came up on this week's podcast with my friend and entrepreneur, Jason Zook. I used to be a hustle bro, 110%, you know, like I had a shirt that said hustle, I had probably a coffee mug that said hustle, I championed working 14 hours a day, like if you didn't work long enough, you weren't working hard enough. And you start to realize like, and I got this phrase from my wife is like, what is it all for? Like, what is all this hustle actually for? Like, what is it getting you to? Because if you get to whatever this arbitrary finish line is that you finally get to, but you're miserable, you're overweight, you're super stressed out, you really resent the thing that you've created because now you all you've done as a work on it and it's not even fun anymore. Like, what was the point? What is it all for? What a simple but amazing question. One of the reasons that minimalism had such a profound impact on my life is that it got me to ask some really difficult but important questions early on. Questions like, what is it all for? Now when I take that question and I apply it to both my work and my personal life, it helps me to gain better alignment on the things that I'm saying yes to. When I think about what it's all for for me, it's about having a good time, it's about not taking myself too seriously and it's about really loving the work that I do and sharing joy with other people. Now to transition to that thing that I was talking about. Specifically, I made a competition to get the rock on Matt's podcast, a jingle competition. If you're new to this channel, I'm trying to get the rock on my podcast. There's a website, he tweeted back at me, twice, my friend left a note on his boat, I'm still nowhere near getting him on the show. So the idea for this jingle competition came from a listener named LA at Vaughan, he asked me if he could make a jingle for my podcast and I thought about it for a while and eventually I thought why not hold a competition. But he still wanted to help, he still wanted to be able to contribute somehow. So I asked him if he could make a jingle for my jingle competition. Now here's the thing, I had every excuse in the world not to make this video. There was no money involved, I'm not trying to trick you into giving me your email address. I just wanted to create this odd silly idea, share it with the world and hopefully encourage you guys to start creating weird things as well and I'm so glad that you did. So the mission started to pour in from all over the world, from India to the UK, Brazil and Illinois, it was amazing to be able to see how creative and also how truly talented many of my listeners are. So I've gotten all these amazing jingles in and I've narrowed them down to the four that best fit the spirit of the show and I'm going to play those for you right now. This first one is from a guy named Sam Tier. What a great jingle. This next one is going to be tough competition. This next one is from Kumar Hans. This is going to be tough. Amanda Douglas made this next jingle with her father and finally we have Joseph Pierce. Number four. Those are the four amazing finalists for the get the rock on Matt's podcast jingle competition. But here's the thing, I couldn't personally choose a winner. It would be too hard for me to say which one was the best, which one should play on the show from here on out. So I'm leaving that up to you. You can vote for your favorite, the one that added the most joy to your life, the one that made you laugh, the one that made you cry, go to get the rock on Matt's podcast.com slash jingle. That's probably way too well. I probably should have made the domain shorter. There will be a link in the description so you can just click that place your vote and then we will have a winner. Diamond. Like Dwayne, it comes the rock. Only seven bucks to his name, and we on a note how you came from where you've been. So come tell your 10 on the ground up show. Dwayne, watch it tell you 10 on the ground up show.
