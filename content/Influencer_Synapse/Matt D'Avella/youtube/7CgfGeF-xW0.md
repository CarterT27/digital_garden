## Transcript
 Mm-hmm. I was living up in Phoenix. I was teaching kids Jesus and I moved to Korea to become an English teacher. I had a job in radio so I switched up the visa high class by class. It was so nice to meet you. It was on the radio like seven nights a week. But my homie telling the jokes to wikahallys speak, made it to year two and almost a year three. Then I saw the move up to NYU, but damn what I'd do that damn. I was trying to move back then, where was my crew at damn. I'm going broke fast, working at this company with this broke ass, waiting on my savings like man. It won't last, I was barely getting paid. I was waiting on a race, but I love my co-workers. I ain't even throwing a shit. I was searching, I was working for a better, brighter day. I was searching, I was lurking, but that day never came. That day never came, so I had to make a change. I do this for the money, I ain't playing no games. So I switched up the flow and then I started freelancing. Growing back my head got me feeling like Samsung. Hey, it got me feeling like feeling like Samsung. Hey, it got me feeling like feeling like feeling like a champion. Hey. Yeah, all right. That was fun. That was fun. Yeah, good. We can use that.
