 What was the transition like coming to New York like why'd you decide to leave school pack up your bags? I felt like I was at a point where it was either You're gonna have like a very stable life and like get serious about school and like do that and then get a job and like take that route Or you're gonna have that moment of like fuck it. I think I can do something bigger like I'm just gonna jump Welcome back to the ground up show. My name is Matt DiVella and that was Tyler Babin Tyler is a photo and video creator for Gary Vaynerch He's traveled with him all around the world documenting his life as well as developing content for his personal brand On the podcast today, I had just a blast talking with Tyler. We discuss content strategy how to simplify your content creation process by focusing on pillars How he turned and Uber ride into his dream job. We also discuss life and death experiences as well as magic tricks So we do discuss a wide range of topics today, but most importantly and my favorite part of the conversation is when we just delve into the craft and really talk about the different Things it takes to produce content at a high level as well as to engage a very large audience Are you enjoying the ground up show do you want to support it?

Let's get to this week's podcast with Babin enjoy the show You're listening to the ground up show a podcast that inspires creatives to make meaningful content and pursue their passions My name is Matty of Ella and I'm a filmmaker best known for the Netflix documentary minimalism And I'm sitting down with creators to talk about their process the lessons they've learned and how to make an impact That was one thing like I'll give you props for that when I started like doing my research about the podcast It was like fuck it looks really good. Thanks man, visually looks good. Like a lot of people like kind of take a shit on the visuals of podcasts just because like The audio is the hero. Yeah, but like looks really good. Thank you man I appreciate that what I was the thing when I started it. I started this last year 2017 I was like I need to bring something a little bit different to the table Especially when everyone in their mom is starting a podcast It's all over the place everybody has a podcast. I was like, all right, how can I do this in my way? And it's funny because when I first thought of the idea of doing it, it's just I was a fan of podcasting But then it was also like how can I do something a little bit differently from filmmaking? I want to kind of take almost a break from filmmaking to try something new and while this is different I just completely brought it in now. I got three cameras light set up and everything every time But I think it does it does help and the one thing that I I knew is that quality there is a level of quality I think that's noticeable from the viewer and like everybody talks about like yeah You can shoot with your iPhone and the quality is so great But there's still like a next level of quality that somebody can watch But oh, that person's actually been doing this for a while a hundred percent Do you watch a lot of podcasts or listen to a lot of podcasts not as much as I used to? I still try and consume podcasts as much as I can but I'm also just like, is it your that I've ever been? So like I've never have time. It's the balance Well, I feel like a bomb listening to podcasts is just going to be like an entire week where I'm not making anything And I'm just listening to shit and then I definitely have a stack like back burner like the things I need to hit And there's people who like I follow closely if they do want I'm like, I have to make sure I slot that in somewhere Yeah, I think it's about kind of including in your routine Whether it's you go for a jog or you go to the gym But at the same time it's very difficult to keep consuming and keep listening to content while your simultaneously Just creating so much Where do you see well first of all before we we go any further? We'll take a step back. Yeah, yeah, yeah, we let people know who the hell you walk through I do an intro before every episode where I'll kind of break down your credentials and give you a little bit of an intro But why don't you just give yourself a intro here tell us a little bit about yourself and what you do? Yeah, so I'm 24 I grew up in Tallahassee, Florida Which is the capital, but don't get too excited It I always tell people like group and florida and they're like nice south beach like that's awesome. I was like no It's like the swamp So I grew up there my whole life I was always really attracted to cameras and and creating I'm a 93 baby So like we digital was like pretty much all I remember And so the ability to like take a shot and see you on the back of the camera was always really attractive to me Just like the instant gratification so my whole life was taking pictures and videos around the house When I got in a high school I went to a very my school had like a very advanced video program It wasn't like a special school or anything. It was just for some reason We had like a new show that we played every Friday, so that's how I learned how to edit and That was just what I was into and so I always didn't think I was going to go to school or anything I was like all right I see what the world's going. I think I can just leave and figure it out and And then my parents were like no you're going to school So ended up messing around in a community college for a little bit two years ago Dropped out moved to New York and ended up working as one of the lead video people for Gary V And that's where you're at right now. Yeah So to get back to the the conversation that we were just jumped right into I am very interested in podcasting where it's going especially like the film side of things And with Gary V you guys film all the podcasts that you do the Ask Gary V And you know we see it with Joe Rogan you see it with now rich role who's on the podcast He started to do the video is that where it's going? Is that do you think like say fast forward five years if you don't have video along with your podcast You're missing out completely I don't think you're missing out completely I think video is a great ad on for people who want to consume that visual But I think the great thing about podcasting is kind of what we were saying is that it can be like The second thing going on in the background You know it's it's all about like saving time and multitasking So you know you can be doing the dishes and be listening to a podcast at the same time So I think audio is definitely always going to be the future But yeah, I think adding that visual component to people who want to like see because there's so much I think it's lost in video right like I'm talking with my hands You don't see that and so I think video is a great way to emphasize things right The main benefit that I've seen is that I can create teasers and excerpts in additional content from it Where I think that the one thing that's challenging about audio podcasts is that you put it out there But then how do you actually get people interested in it? So you have a big you have Tony Robbins on your podcast and you're like all right Like it would be great if I had a piece of content that I could share with Tony that he could share with his audience And with audio it's challenging like you could do the motion graphics You can do the text overlay and stuff But it's it's kind of limiting and even that is not easy to do like the motion graphics to me would take way longer Or cost way more than just doing straight video. Yeah, I mean that kind of goes right along with Gary's thesis of like We do micro content is honestly probably more important than the hero piece in a lot of ways You know having those things you can distribute out to people and get attention to the podcast is the ultimate hack Right, so if you can kind of use that video to your advantage That's where it's going to come into play and it's also an incredible way to leverage your own following and growth right If you're making custom pieces of content for those people and for the most part like if you're interviewing people on a podcast Like they have an audience that you're interested in like siphoning out of So giving them something and exchange for you know a tag on the Instagram post is beneficial for them Because they get value and content but also it's going to get more attention on what you're doing Yeah, and I've been on podcasts before where they'll say hey, can you share this you know on your Instagram or can you share this on Twitter or whatever And whenever I do it and to their credit they've done this as well But never never put pressure in somebody because it's their audience. They do whatever they want So I always put in parentheses and I'll send you an email after this But hey, here's the content teasers if you want absolutely no pressure to share it because I truly Literally you coming on the podcast is you doing something amazing. You know any like one thousand percent like like expecting anything from people is like Loser mentality You have to like provide all the value up front and be okay like going into it be okay with like you might not get the thing you want out of it Yeah, exactly and I think a lot of people especially when they're starting out they they always kind of expect something or are trying to get something And it's it's subtle in the way that somebody maybe might send an email and it's like you know really appreciate what you do this That's that and then all of a sudden at the end is the ask and like they're trying to get something out of you or they want something They want you to share something or check out their channel and it's like I think we have to get into a habit of actually just trying to Spread whether it's positivity saying like hey really love your channel You know appreciate your content and then period that's it like don't try to get something out of every single interaction For sure, I don't think I don't necessarily think the ask is the bad thing like if you're providing enough value up front Like Gary's whole thing is like give give give give give give and then ask and so it's I think that it's okay to make those asks but don't go in like don't expect to like give Something and have the expectation of definitely getting something in return right yeah because I at some point you do need to actually Make these asks and these requests right and it's not I think it's like it's a balancing art to actually I did just recently So see a nice piece of advice where they were saying you know if you're reaching out to an old friend and you're asking them for something Don't hide the fact that you're asking from something like switch it and then the very first thing you'll say is like hey, you know, hey Brian Do you mind if you like my Facebook page real quick would really appreciate it? By the way, I hope you're doing well as opposed to saying hey hope you're doing well haven't seen you in a while Can you like my Facebook page like that switch where you're just being honest with people and letting them know upfront Whether it's an ask or whether you know you have to have your intentions be pretty obvious from the frame front It's just it's just authenticity right like people are smart. They're gonna see through that any time I get a DM from someone who I haven't talked to in two years And it just says like hey, I hope you're doing well. I'm like I know something's about to have come in, you know So let's go back and talk a little bit about your story and you know that Florida come up what was the first camera you got your hands on So my first sort of real video camera was a Sony handy cam. That's the first one that I wrote That was like I mean just actually actually going a step back. It was a cannon mini dv cam Which was like I got when I was 10 and so I referenced the handy cam as like the first one had like a hard drive I could just straight plug in because before it was like you had to record the footage onto the computer to like start editing So the handy cam was where the focus really was and it all started in video So it was it did the job I needed it to do and then it could also shoot like eight megapixel stills on the handy cam And so I started shooting stills a lot with it and then when I was finishing up high school I was like oh there's a transition where I actually think photography might be more interesting What was it that drew you away from video at that point? Why why was photography more? I don't want to say drew me away from video was more is it like an addition It was just being able to want it was faster like just the ability to like capture moment be like cool We have that like we can move on that was interesting But also when you're like learning and it's lower budget You can get more like professional results I want to say through still photography and you came video Especially with like being like a Photoshop kid who like understood how to manipulate things I say the same thing for the difference between doing dock style work and narrative type work Where that's why most of my focus in my career early on as a freelancer was just doing the more dock style And like even if a tech client would come to me, we primarily try to make it feel authentic And in the moment capturing you guys while you're working Because holy shit would that be more challenging to bring a dolly in and bring the lights head up And hire actors and do all that extra stuff There's an easy way in a hard way to do it And when you're first getting started it's probably best to not try to you know Because when you're starting out you're not going to get a 50,000,000 dollar budget for a video So you have to work with what you got And I think that's probably the best way to do it 100% So what we're some of those early video projects that you were doing with the handy cam Like what kind of stuff are you shooting like skateboard videos or so it's funny you say that It was like I loved skateboarding and like be a Mexican stuff and like all my friends in the neighborhood We would like go and build up little ramps and stuff So I was always doing that but it actually came up through card magic Which is kind of weird what you make card magic videos Yeah, they still exist out there on the web. I'll show you something Yeah, it was a so when I first moved I moved from Gainesville to Tallahassee I had no friends. It was like it was a fresh move and I was going straight into sixth grade So it was like a school transition too. So it was a big one And I got paired up is a locker body with this kid named Philip who like I feel like I and some weird way Oh, all my success too. I really want to like try and find them. Yeah And he was from Korea. He had just moved to America like new no English But could do magic tricks and so that was like our way of communication And I wanted to learn how to do them but like he couldn't speak English And so we couldn't tell me so I found a magic store in Tallahassee Got my mom to take me there one morning and spent like six hours there And got obsessed with card tricks and like befriended like the magician there And so I got really into card magic and that was like my whole like from sixth grade To like graduating high school I was known as like the magic kid above like the photography kid Which is cool super fun people with minds. Yeah What like so you're you're drawn into magic and you just what do you do in the card tricks Yeah, just like random card tricks and it was just like my way of doing something to like fill my time But I I was an only child and so I was like alone a lot during the day like my parents were at work I needed to see what the tricks looked like from like the perspective of someone viewing it So I started filming myself and then like watching the footage back And then I realized I could make the tricks I was doing way more interesting through like editing Like I can like move the ball to the other side of the room and then just like cut out me moving it And so that's how I learned editing was through making card magic Oh, it's so clever. Yeah, I remember I got into magic I think it was probably because I was trying to pick up girls, but I don't think that's actually that's also a great way to get Did it work well for you because we didn't work well for me Like I guess like when it comes like down to it, maybe it didn't But yeah, I'm trying to talk to people right exactly like to approach people and I I was like way too old to be getting I don't know you could get in the magic at any age, but I feel like I got into it Like I was trying to do it This is early on like I was telling you about some of the early stuff I was doing with like hip hop and rappers And I was shooting behind the scenes music videos for this company called robot films Who does like a lot of they do a lot of hip hop It was a Mario music video with a wallet was I think I think he was just hanging out You know I always people just hanging out and then like so I was with like a couple friends there And I was just doing behind the scenes filming and then they knew like in the car and stuff I was just practicing these magic tricks and like the one classic magic trick where you palm the card and lift it up And then they pick up put their card on top and then you put it back up Oh, yeah, and you take off the top card put it in the center and then their card is still on top And that is it's so nerve wracking to do any kind of trick because like you're like they're gonna see me They're gonna see me and like I don't know it's just it's very hard to hide those tails 100% And then they ended up uh they called like you was during one of the breaks on the music video They called the whole crew and cast and everybody together Literally Mario and Wally are like right next to me like Wally is the one that's pulling the card off the top of the deck and I'm freaking the fuck out I'm like dude, I'm so nervous right now That's amazing and then I ended up like I tricked them But it was like it wasn't They because I basically what what I did was I had two of the same card Which is the only thing that can confuse them Is I well okay, I am I know how you did that part, but I don't know how you did that But like doing magic is a really nerve wracking experience Yeah, did you ever get totally comfortable with it where you're like I can just I got better at it for sure Because I mean it was really like 60 hours a day of my life was like doing magic tricks I got like obsessive to like a weird place And so I was I could get pretty comfortable and like in doing weird sight of hand stuff But you I mean you think you always get nervous because you're like directly like I'm gonna fool you You know and like people want to catch you. Yeah, they do yeah Like there's nothing but I remember like my high school talent show like I fucked up and like got cold out in front of like 500 people Oh really? Oh fuck I know that's so hard to like even is that one of his memories Will you look back and you still like I know just like it's like a fringe where they and like I didn't handle it all Well, it was just like I forget you guys It's so bad if they knew how much how important it was that they didn't figure it out I think people would be a little bit more kind although I do the same thing. I'm like especially you know When you're watching David Blaine or whatever Once you know a couple of the basic tricks that people do you kind of know where to look and you kind of you can see their hands or if like they're doing It's all David Blaine did one with George Bush where he stole his watch And you can see him like early on in the trick shake his hand and that's when he steals it Yeah, Mr. Ections crazy Like that's what it all comes down to you can do anything. You can get someone's attention somewhere. You have to do Mr. Ection is so tough when you people are so focused on you Yeah, I think it all depends on the person like some people it's so funny. I didn't expect this to be such a magic Incredible. Yeah, I think there's people who genuinely like want to be in the experience and sort of want to be fooled and the people who like all they want to do And maybe this is more of a discussion on like types of people in the world, but they just want to like catch you and like break it And so it's sort of like you have to like pick who you're who you're putting your attention towards right there is like almost like a something about Humans that are attracted to magic because it's the mystery. It's like the spiritual element to it. It's like the unknown That's why people are like interested in ghosts and ghost hunting all that I had once where my girlfriend she called me. This is not ghost related Although she is I think she does believe in ghosts. She is not comfortable saying the apartment when I'm not there But what do we do we did she call me late at night. She was out like with work friends and there was a guy doing magic at the bar and I'm like I think he's just trying to pick you up And he She called me from I think his phone or something and then they asked me she's a quick. I need to you to answer this question and then I said the word and then he like was able to call out the word And I don't know how the hell he did it and I'm like did they have a third line there But some of the that's the thing where it's like the rule of magic is don't tell reveal the secret It's never honestly because the secrets make it sort of boring Like a lot of magic tricks are way more simple than what people realize But like the mystery and like all the build up makes it so much more entertaining Like it's funny I like I remember being a kid and like people wanted to learn it And it's like it's disappointing when you learn the trick a lot of times because it's like actually there was just an extra card there Like that's the whole secret Like every wanted to be this like big massive thing, but it's sort of a let down Do you think in some ways that's true for editing special effects filmmaking? Yeah, is it a let down? I don't know it's it's not quite the same kind of thing But like a lot of people would be like oh, I would love to just follow you around and be a fly on the wall in your day to day And you be like it's actually quite boring. You know what's so funny? I get that DM all the time or people like can I just come shadow you for a day I'm like you're just gonna sit behind my laptop for 12 hours and like watch me click a few buttons over Yeah, I think people want to think there's a trick to it outside of just like doing the work Mm-hmm, you know, and I think that also when people see the final video the final edit the music and the cuts and it evokes an emotion and a feeling out of people To the point where they almost think that that emotion or feeling is how the whole experience is Yeah, it's always like high energy. It's always excitement when you said you know, sometimes it's just 12 hours behind a laptop editing clicking away It's so funny because like is much as so much my life is editing. I kind of hate editing for that Like I love like being out in the field and like recording stuff and especially as I'm doing the more travel things And I'm it's like more extreme and I'm jumping off cliffs and like that's all great And then the the middle ground between like those extremes and like putting the actual video out is kind of like I don't want to say depressing But it's just like the law Mm-hmm, sometimes it's also very challenging to get through certain edits Yeah, like when you just get stuck on something and you're like yeah, I mean creative blocks are very real fun. It's so tough Yeah, I was I had a Joe Bèchenkowski on the podcast a couple episodes ago and he was talking about He's actually he edited the Zen Dyeries of Gary Shandling, which is on HBO now He did objectified a bunch of great night like when I watched these I'm like this guy is a master at editing He really knows what he's doing and he's like He the one thing that stood out was like he's like storytelling is really challenging and people don't say that enough He's like I don't care if I'm with John Apatau or if I'm with Ira Glass if we're in the room together There are moments when we're just looking at a problem and just saying I don't know how the hell we're gonna get through this Yeah, and that's the thing is storytelling is really challenging and it just sometimes it just all it is just keep going just keep trying to work through a problem Yeah, I think that's one thing I've come through recently is I would let myself get a block and I would just like stare at a timeline for hours and be like I can't move on until I figure out this thing My biggest way of getting through it is just like keep flipping thing just like never stop clicking around and like I'll just like I make like 20 duplicate sequences And I'm just mixing moving different clips and eventually something you'll kind of click that's for me That's the best way to get through it right you can't just stare blankly at the pace because I have like I literally it's it's funny I have a project that I've been editing for like six months that's gonna be like a two-minute video and it's because I just can't get through it I'm just looking at it and I can't figure one problem. I just can't figure out and I've just been staring at it And it's like no good comes out of that. What's the video is a personal project? It's a it's a film I shot in Costa Rica last year And it was a it was a collaboration with a backpack company called Lifepack who I've become like very friendly with And we were just like let's just do something I was like my 24th birthday I had it left the country yet And I was like I want to get out of the states and I want to do something weird and so we uh we just like packed up bags We bought flights to Costa Rica with zero plan. It's been a week there and just filmed with just the Costa Rica trip that It was kind of crazy. You told me a little bit about this. I mean for being like the first trip out of the country It got pretty wild so Whenever we were like picking places like Central America always seemed interesting to me But when I was getting ready to go people are like yeah, Central America can be kind of dangerous like You know really watch your back and everything so we flew into San Jose and Within five minutes of getting our rental car someone rolls up on a motorcycle slashes the tires on the car And like peels out and luckily of my friend was sitting in the back seat and saw it happen So apparently what happens is like they roll up stab your tires You pull over to change them like you're not supposed to see it happen And then whenever you're out changing the car people like roll up on you and take all your stuff Shit, that's so scary. Yeah, and so it was luckily we were close enough to like the rental car place We just drove back but they were like yeah, like you were in the parking lot of logging and they saw your camera And like you were targeted. Oh my god, which like being a kid who just like grew up in very like suburban America Like talk about putting yourself outside of your comfort zone quickly First time out of the country. Yeah first time out of the country in Central America That's a for it dude. I went to Costa Rica too. That was my first trip out of the country I think maybe that's just the spot It's a great spot where you go in Costa Rica Um, so we flew into San Jose and then we just pretty much drove like the entire country But we spent a lot of time in Santa Teresa which is like a little surf village and then a Haco Beach Oh, that's great man. It is like what an amazing experience At first time in another country like everything is in Spanish You're like yeah, it was it was so funny because I remember like doing the customs form on the plane It was the first time I had ever seen something where like Spanish was the primary language Which maybe makes me sound like super uncultured and everything but like even that was a strange experience Right, I like I think there's an element now that like our world is so opened up that we can see An experience other cultures online But I think that you still have to go there to I think it's it's maybe something that's like kind of unconscious that happens But you're just like when you're fully immersed in another culture it does open yourself up And you're like oh shit, there's more than just yeah, it's funny because like so it was August of last year So it's been less than a year was the first time I left the country. I've since left almost 20 times I think with Gary like it got really crazy last year. I got weird like every other day. I was out of the country But I feel like I've grown up more in the last year like experiencing the rest of the world And I think maybe that's where like the passion for all these like travel projects and trying to do is like getting more outside of your comfort zone and seeing other parts of like how the world lives Right same it just changes your perspective completely So back to the wait there was one more part of that story where you guys almost drove off a cliff Yeah, yeah, that's about so we had like this crazy Jeep rental car and our whole like motto was like if we're gonna go for it We're really gonna go for it and like offer the whole way And so we're driving from like one village to another and we got to this like cliff where it was like right at golden hour And it was amazing so like we like stopped we pull out everything and we filmed for like an hour But it killed all of our daylights who were driving through the jungle for the rest of the night and like pitch black darkness And the guy driving Adrian who's like become one of my best friends It was just being done. We're doing like 70 miles an hour through like the jungle just like you can't see anything and And all throughout the day he had been purposely hitting puddles to like make a splash And he's like for fun stuff and for some reason we're like blasting through and he doesn't hit this puddle that's off to the side, but it's huge And then I'm like wait a second and I like freak out and start screaming. I'm like I think that's a cliff And we were literally maybe a foot away from the straight driving off the side of a mountain What the fuck dude? It was like I don't even like here in this right because he was doing the puddles the whole time I know I was like literally for some because it was so dark It just looked like a puddle off of the side Like how's it be could have died that could have been it. Yeah Isn't that what that that changes you I think like when you were like that close to a near death experience Or like that could have been it that could have been the end of my life Yeah, what I First I'm out of I know like just thinking back to it. I was like actually a lot of things I did on that trip. We're just super dumb like I think I played way too close to the edge But yeah, first time out of the country that was kind of extreme what was what's your thought process in a near death experience like that is it like Like what what are you thinking? I think in the moment I wasn't thinking the more I I look back at it I'm like wow like it could have actually gone really bad really quickly. Yeah, you know like it's funny because my friends that were with like we joke about it a lot But like if you really think about it like that could have been completely life altering so like really don't waste a second Because we're in like Costa Rica where like yeah, we're gonna go have fun when making a movie Like it's just gonna be this adventure like look how great life is and like it could have gone bad Yeah, but yeah like Jeff Staples who is a he's a fashion designer. He runs staple pigeon out of New York If he if there's anyone that I sort of like if I like compare who I want to be like when I grow up it's him and he says that too. He's like Yeah, near death experiences are crazy like you should try and have some of it now No, yeah, he's like don't die, but you know if you can get close just near enough Just like some bad turbulence like it wakes you up a little bit more Yeah, so you go to Costa Rica and you shoot on this footage. You've got tons of it and that was a year or two years ago and What's the problem now what's what's the challenge in this edit with the problem that you're not so getting through I think there's a few things One it's personal expectations on this being this was my first big project outside of work outside of like when I was looking at where I Want the future of my career to go. I was like I'm really into like travel films and I'm doing you know weird branded content So I think a ton of it is completely mental and that I won't let myself get through it Because I need it to be perfect I think perfection super dangerous But I've restarted the edit probably 10 times and I'm trying to like get it better and better and better But I think honestly, I think it's all romantic Me needing it to be perfect. Yeah, you know, yeah I don't think that it's going to be because it's my first and the funny thing is I've now done other travel films that I put out sooner because it's like It's like whatever it's just another video, but for some reason like that one being the first one It's like my baby It's probably you probably never going to finish it or you're it's never going to be you're never going to be happy with I literally like have been thinking about it I like brought the hard drive on this trip because I was thinking I was going to work on it. I might just export whatever it is like it might have black spots And I'm trying to get it out there in the world. It's like fuck it, you know So this wasn't actually a client project Not necessarily so I'm a big component on like free work and also I'm so busy with Gary that I hate taking money from people because of like deadline expectations And I have just like no real control in my life So I like a lot of people ask me to do collaborations and stuff and I will but it's always like I'm doing it for free at my own pace And I will figure it out as we get there So have you ever done paid work or paid client work at this point? When I was younger so coming up through Florida but the transition from Florida to New York I was really into fashion photography and so I had sort of hacked it there I was doing a lot of like catalog stuff for like local stores I definitely had a wedding phase where I was shooting a ton of weddings Senior portraits like all that stuff But it was a pretty short gap of I've been sort of like a salary creator for the majority of my career What was the transition like coming to New York like why did you decide to leave school pack up your bags? I felt like I was at a point where it was either You're going to have like a very stable life and like get serious about school and like do that and then get a job and like take that route Or you're going to have that moment of like fuck it. I think I can do something bigger like I'm just going to jump and And at that point I was 21 when I moved to New York so I was like all right I'm in a place where like I just have to do it like I just can't wonder what if anymore The original name of this podcast was going to be when I was living in New York how to make it in New York Because just first so I'm I don't know how I made it and I just think of other people that are going to the Moving to the city and the kind of rent that you have to pay and how low salaries are when you first get started You're making 30 35,000 a year and like rent costs like 15 to 20,000 plus a year And it's like how the hell do people get by? What was that like in the very beginning or 21 years old are you living with roommates? How do you get your first internship? Yeah, so luckily I had locked in the internship before I moved It was like that was like the catalyst of like getting that it was like all right I'm big on like patience and waiting for the stars to align But I would say like when it looks like the stars are aligned like all in pocketed go So I had been saving a lot of money knowing that there was probably going to be a transition coming up soon So I had a little bit of the bank and then the internship happened and I just like packed up two bags One way to get in left posted a Facebook status at the time because I had like no following at this point I was like yo anyone over room in New York so I got this little crummy spot that was far too expensive in Bushwick And moved in there I you know the first six months that I was there was making $12 an hour isn't in turn like making nothing So it was super tight. It was like the peanut butter and jelly ramen diet every meal six months Oh, no questions asked But I think I was okay with it like I think if you go in with that mentality of like you're cool Like you're going to cut all luxuries like it's just like you're going to put your head down and work and figure it out It honestly didn't feel that difficult to me. You know what was it like was it like a real grind When I first got the whole book and I would say it wasn't like a real grind and the thing was that I lived at home with my parents for two years So I was and like I'm all about Like you it's like waiting for the stars to line but at the same time like being conservative and Me going into a hundred thousand dollars in student loan debt that was my wake-up call to be like dude You just can't make decisions so flippantly like maybe you should listen to your parents and community college would have been good for a couple years So at that point I also realized how much of a weight that money and that debt was weighing over me So I was like I need to be very mindful about the decisions that I'm making moving forward. So I paid off a lot of my debt I mean I probably had sixty thousand by the time I left to go to to move to New York, but then also You know when you you talk about like security and safety It's like we all get comfortable with the certain amount of money in our bank account Yeah, and for me like it started out like like thirteen dollars, which I wasn't comfortable with at all But then when you save that first thousand dollars then I'm like all right now. I'm like I feel good I feel especially not having rent. Yeah. I'm like I feel pretty comfortable with that And then it was Knowing that I'd probably have to get especially as a freelancer somebody following an untraditional path I'm like I need at least like fifteen to twenty thousand to where I will be Super comfortable knowing that even if I have three to four months where I don't get any work I can still pay off my bills and and and some So that was that was my mentality going into it. So it was very conservative And then having that money and having that runway was just everything like it I didn't stress out about rent ever You know you would stress out about am I going to you know is the work going to come in or the jobs come in But eventually they eventually they always do yeah, I mean it's just like to pivot on that to like try and provide more value People I think Casey Nicea has this quote and it's like It's something about like your willingness to take risk like will you know expand your life And I'm big on that like I think taking risks and like walking away from opportunities and trying Like the untraditional path is huge But I've also seen people who just like you have to be pretty realistic with it like don't like make a jump if you have no money You know because like it's still the way the world works Right because if you if you do jump before you have your parachute You're trying to build your parachute on the way down You're more likely to give up and to fail if you don't have that security net Because eventually you're like fuck I have to pay bills Like I'm gonna have to go get a traditional day job and then you get complacent and then it's like it Like I literally think jumping to where it leads like the demise of everything I think you're totally right and I think that that's the thing though because like that's the advice everybody gives This is take the jump do it and like yes do it but be thoughtful about it Like make sure you have enough money to give by make sure that like your partner can help support if think if things go wrong Like there's a lot of things you have to think about and like you said this is the real world This is like we have to be practical about these decisions that we're making in life Um So what was the internship that first job? It was that Vayner. Oh, was that Vayner? Yeah, cool. So yeah, so it was funny because I had a you know chase Jarvis like Seattle photographer I had he was always as I was growing up in Florida I was like I want to be that guy. I'm gonna work for him one day And so he had a podcast that Gary was on and then at the end of that podcast I had no idea who Gary was I was like fuck I think I actually want to work for Gary He seems way more interesting and so then it was like every move I was making was like how do I work for Gary? So the master plan was getting internship at Vayner eventually turned that internship into like a staff job work for a couple years Meet Gary in the hallway and be like yo. I want to work directly with you like that was in theory how was going to play out And instead it was go I got a graphic design internship did that for like six or seven months and then There was a freeze on hiring creatives that would just like all right. We're gonna hold off for a little bit And so I had been like just grinding my face off for like seven months and then I get an email one day and it's like sorry We don't have a job for you like See ya So that was devastating that was that was like the one moment where I can be like yo New York really punched me in the face and I walked out and like had no idea what was next I like thought I was gonna move back home and like it was like all right gonna get my desk job, you know And so I emailed Gary and I was like yo I came here because I wanted to say what's up to you and eventually wanted to work with you But like I got a leave so can I have five minutes to say what's up? That meeting got canceled but I was like it's my last day. It has to happen So he was jumping in an Uber. I jumped with him and luckily it was like three o'clock in the afternoon So New York traffic was completely gridlocked and our five minute meeting turned into an hour and then by the end of that Peace is a pretty much set in place that I think the next day. I was on his team working directly with him And so it's been two years All right, yeah, all right How did that Uber come down how did it how did that actually happen like were you we like waiting outside for Gary to come out of the office Or was that like kind of a little bit part of the plane where it's like hey my meeting just on canceled But we can hop in this Uber so that's basically how it happened It initially it was like yo we're gonna reschedule you for next week and I was like I don't know if I won't be here next week Like it has to happen and he was like all right Screw what you can go and just ride with him so it was like jumped in the car I was so prepared for a five minute meeting with Gary like I just had everything locked in and then the entire plan is out the fucking window And two minutes because I was just like, oh, we actually have to have a conversation now And I have to like be on my feet and so I was like nervous like shaking on the car and Well, everybody's got a plan to they get punched in the face like that's what yeah I think Tyson said it where it's like you get into the ring and then all of a sudden all bets are off and you just got to figure out what to fuck You know, the thing that's amazing too is it's like D-rock the other video guy. I'm Gary's team has been there about two years before me He's in the car with us filming the entire conversation so our entire meeting is like documented in history That's amazing. I want to put it out, but I actually just found the footage recently and washed it and I sounds so ridiculous So you're nervous that's kind of what I would expect very to be although like I was like maybe maybe you just turned it on And I didn't it's like a little feral in that movie where he blacks out and like is it is a is a great depator So you're in the you're in the car and like your nervous, but then what is it about that that like inspires Gary to have you come on I mean I was pretty audacious because at this point I'm like, yeah, I got I just put all my chips on the table and so it was literally gone in the car I was like I want to work for you and he's like you got a like laughs and he's like, okay, what do you do? You know And so we just talked for a long time and he asked me like his my opinions on what his content was doing and what I think that I could add and What could be changed and I really had no answer I was it was completely like fake it till you make it just trying to sound as smart as possible, but he bought it And so Walking out of that he asked me to make a few pieces of content and so he's like make like five things of how you would do it If if you were on the team and I was like all right, and so he like kicks me out on 57th street I run strict with Starbucks like just grind out for like two hours email I wanted it to be like as fast as possible, so it was like they were pretty sloppy, but I just needed to like get something in his inbox And then a couple days later I got a call to like HR which and it was funny because I thought this was like the last day my internship I was like cool. It's like the thanks for coming by like give me your name badge and all that and she's like You know why you're here and I said no, she's like you start around Gary seems tomorrow And I was like shit That's kind of feel so good. That was crazy. Dude that I love that that I mean I think the couple things that obviously you you know Gary very well And what he would respond to and it was like I think just like the initiative in the hospital that you put into that Both just in the meeting and just making that shit happen like you made that happen Yeah, and then Two hours later like I love that just like Because some people would just let that opportunity go or they might like take too long to to send an email you can't send an email week later Yeah, like you're like fuck. I'm gonna do this right now like it was what did you make in that then there's two hours? It was um Like he does a lot of like quote cards for Instagram, so it was four of those where I just like found pictures of him off Google and like Slaughtered them in luckily They had his brand style guide On like the VaynerMedia server, so I had found that earlier and I was like familiar with like the fonts and stuff and I was like cool So I made like four like very on brand like quote cards and then one video where I just like ripped an interview off YouTube really quick and like through some stock footage on top of it with like words flying across the screen Wow, that's great, man. They had to feel so good. Yeah, so that was the moment of like I remember walking out of that meeting and like I walked into a stairwell and like just sat down It was like a scene out of a movie and just sat down was like Wow like I did you know, which it was like that was just the beginning, but but that was a moment where I was like cool Like I think I'm gonna be okay. Yeah, make your break moment. Yeah, like you this is it, right? You because it would literally do like literally I would have moved back to Florida. I think Because I at this point I had been making so little money. I had like blown through a lot of the savings that I had had saved up just on rent in those six months And I was like kind of like getting down to the wire and was like all right I'm just gonna have to go back home like move back in with that and I'll figure it out once I get there Skill wise craft wise as a filmmaker photographer a designer You know, I love your Instagram today. It's like beautiful all the photos are stunning like super high quality really creative Jump back to that that moment like were you that good or have you just developed like crazy over the past two years? I definitely have developed like crazy. Yeah, I think when you surround yourself with like people I think that's actually the hack is like get yourself in rooms with people that are substantially better than you and Then you're gonna have to level up quickly. I think for me that's been the biggest thing and especially being a New York I have that great benefit of like New York's the place where all the best creatives in the world go to to prove themselves It's just like the overall energy of that city. You're like all right. I really got a step. I should up. You know But yeah, I would say in the last two years it's funny if you actually go to my website And look in the photo section none of it's updated in two years and so you can really see the delta between like my Instagram and the website of like There's been a jump. This has been the shift over the last two years. What had man so as you start to onboard Do you remember the first day And we're at least the first you know what's so funny Out of that HR meeting she said cool Gary wants you to go be a designer on his team and I said cool and then the very first day there They handed me a hard drive of videos and they're like cool your video editor In mind you I've at this point had taken a break from video for like a year and then all of a sudden it was like figure out video again And so I had like a lot of like base level knowledge and stuff, but it was definitely completely like This isn't what I signed up for so yeah, like you hadn't put in that many hours in terms of editing It's not like that's been like that was your craft for the past couple years. That wasn't my bread and butter at all It was photography and design and so I had to like crash core so like not sleeping for six months and learning is much about videos possible Wow, right you talk about like that's the thing that I told people it's like dude doesn't matter What you're doing in college it matters what you're doing outside of the classroom It's like you you've got to put in the work and like if you take six months and you're just like Pound it against the the pavement then I think that's when you're gonna make the biggest progress Yeah, so I mean it was getting into the office seven in the morning leaving it ten at night and then from Ten to two in the morning watching tutorials on YouTube of like trying to like really turn the nitty gritty and then also I luckily was able to like step up and they were like oh, they think they seem even though like the edits are rough Like you've got potential and so I got thrown into the deep end of editing daily v every day Seven days a week for like six months Wow, and you kind of have no other choice but to like learn the craft really quickly high stakes too, man Very it's not like this is going out to a couple thousand people no like a YouTube channel with a million subscribers You know, so what's it? I mean I guess what's the approval process like there and like how does that look when when you're making a piece? I'm sure it's evolved over time as you've gotten better But when you're starting to make these pieces that go out to this large audience What's the approval? I mean so the cool thing is Gary sort of doesn't care in terms of creative so for the longest time he was watching all the videos But it was not to judge it creatively It was to judge it based on like confident reality and like what could actually be out there in the world because when you figure We are filming you know eight hours a day of meetings There's a lot of stuff that like the world shouldn't be hearing and so he was always watching it Just to check those things and to like cut them out here and there Now he like trust us enough and we have I mean we've been in it for so long that we know In general we always go more on the vanilla side to make sure that like everything's safe That's going out in the world, but we have no approval process like I Filment I added it I upload it the next day And that's it It's just there's so much content that you're creating so I like I think let's start there like what kind of content are You guys making now when you look at because you have you know Vayner Media and you have like All that stuff aside there's lots of stuff and lots of companies going around But now we're just talking about Gary Vee. He's got this personal brand and he's got content creators like you That work together how big's the team and how much content are you guys putting out? Yeah, so I mean that's one of the biggest things to start off with the delta between Vayner Media and Gary these Like personal team are very different. We vary like rarely or like crossing paths And so we function very differently like when I say there's no approval process like and typical agency World has to go through eight rounds for approval before anything goes live. So that's a big difference Currently Gary's team floats around 23 to like 25 people We're always sort of like people are coming in and out And the large majority of that is creative so there's four people that are working on video at all times There's you know four designers. There's a writer We have a developer who's full-time working on apps and stuff like that Overall people who are managing brand Gary has two assistants like it's all like a big machine All of the content stems out of Like pillars, right? So there's the ask Gary Vee show and daily Vee Those kind of overlap but everything else just stems from all that footage So those are the two hero pieces and then it's what's the best minute out of this day that we filmed in daily Vee Which turns into an Instagram clip for 60 seconds and then there's 130 second version That goes on Facebook and then we strip the audio out of it and that goes on sound cloud for the podcast and then The writer watches an episode Recaps it and writes a blog post and then that goes on LinkedIn so that's like it all starts with two and then everything like teeters down I love that because like when you're first looking at it 23 people sounds crazy. I'm like what the hell? That's like a huge massive team But then the pillars is so important because otherwise I feel like it would just be so scattered It's like and organize that and you like I don't know if you have any like project managers in there as well Or it's just kind of Gary and then it just creators really is that's for the most part It's just Gary and then creators and I would say that's probably our weaker point. Yeah, is um We sort of need someone to be a little bit more like orchestrating and like making sure things are like organized and stuff And we've gotten way better at it now than what we were here Go so we have like Gary has his own server that everything gets managed on by date and time and all that stuff Is opposed to a year and a half ago like it was when it was just de-rock and I it was Everything is on portable drives scattered there's like 20 drives on my desk and so if someone's like find this piece of footage And I'm like it's gonna take 12 hours so I can search all these things. It was it was a mess But we've really like we're tightening up and getting it pretty pretty put together But we're also just doing something that's never really been done before You know like how many people have 25 people that just work on their personal brand like wild That's crazy. I mean you look at like somebody like Tim Ferriss Massive podcasts his teams like two three people tops like he's like he's got one full-time employee. I think and then maybe interchangeable one or two he's not creating The amount of content that you guys are putting out you're just like putting a massive amount of content And that's the only way that you can do it is like I mean that's the thing that I struggle with too because I'm like It's a one-person team and like that's I mean that's what you need to do in the very beginning when you're starting out But it was for me trying to figure out all I like what do I want to focus on like what's my most important thing? And I'm like all right podcasts, you know ground up show. Let me focus on that and then how can I just like you guys separate the two but then it's It's there's also like I don't know you you have to also be drawn to where what's making an impact right like how much of that changes what you're doing where You see that some videos are doing really well or performing really well Does that shift your perspective of how you create content moving forward? Absolutely. I mean we're always like nitpicking the format of videos on Instagram and like we're seeing what's working We do a weekly recap every day. We're not every day but every week where we say all right these are the things that performed best Why were these different than other ones and how can we take those elements and like deploy it further? And then we we make things that are timely. So Gary had a video a couple of years ago about graduating from college That went bonkers into 50 million views or something on Facebook and so we have a whole content plan around that piece of footage That we're gonna really distribute even harder this year and like a couple weeks whenever Everyone's graduating from college Okay, cool. So you can kind of start the plan that out and look at cultural moments. I mean because like Vainer media like core part of that is like strategy content creation and like working with brands and figuring out how to Deliver for them and it's like all right. Let's take those same kind of methods and ideas and implement it for For Gary's actual personal brand Can we Ask Gary Vee what is ask Gary Vee and what's the other one daily Vee so ask Gary Vee is the the question and answer podcast show Which is like literally there's a phone in the middle. There's two guests they're calling people and just having like business questions or life Questions answered and then daily Vee is the documentation of Gary's life and that Wherever he is there's someone there with a camera that's filming it. Okay, and then the ask Gary you said there's an overlap between him It's that because then someone just takes excerpts from the yeah, yeah, just in terms of like Gary's living his life if he's doing a question and answer show that day There's a person and they're filming the question and answer show and like bits of pieces of that might go in Different places right and how often is the podcast? Totally ebs and flows based on Gary's calendar because that's the thing is is so many people think Gary is just like A motivational speaker and like hangs out and does cool stuff but 95% of his time is spent like running an advertising agency And he's just living his life so if he's you know super intense on the business side We might go two or three weeks without an ask Gary Vee sometimes we have four weeks. It's totally different do you guys Stockpile these as in like in terms of recording them like to create consistency or is it like sometimes You'll have two weeks without an episode being released or just so it's a basically you say if you Recorded and shot a podcast episode today how long does it take to come out and It'll all get slotted in so basically we have a content calendar that's built out for like a week Usually that's all we're sort of working with of what we know is going out But that's all random so it might be a daily video episode and then a keynote that he gave and then maybe it's A full length meeting out of a daily V that'll go in one day like we're totally like fixing the plane as we fly it Just like figuring it out. Yeah, and so yeah, I mean we might go two weeks without an ask Gary V But also we don't keep anything in the tank like if it's done it's going out that's sort of that's a big thing with us Two is just like overall speed so if we film a get an ask Gary V yesterday It's probably gonna go out within the next two days. I think that's probably an element to A larger operation like that right. Yeah, I was gonna say like that's how we're able to function with so many people It's like we film it and then there's an editor who they're only job is to make sure like the video gets edited It gets ready for the podcast and the micro content the Instagram clips are ready for that We make sure that the guest has stuff like it's a whole like structured thing What's the the strategy behind the This content that you're creating is there like an overarching strategy or goal or Um, yeah, I guess like how do you know what kind of content to be making? So When people ask like the overall goal, it's Gary's thing is like you build a personal brand and that other doors start opening when the world knows who you are Right, so if like Gary's clouds is that he wants to buy the New York Jets The best thing to do is get the most of the world to know who Gary is so that more business opportunities open That he can take those Leverage it and eventually do the thing he wants to do which is by the Jets Right, does that make sense like it's all like I hate that buying the Jets Yeah, well, I hate saying like Our strategy is make Gary the most famous person in the world, but that's sort of What it is. I'm gonna weird way. You know, it's it's get as many people because a lot of Vaynermediate clients that are coming through or like coming through because of the personal brand work We're doing mm-hmm. No, right because people know who Gary is. Yeah. That's the thing is it's A lot of this is very personal based and as it's funny because if you look at the way that blogs and personalities Online personalities have evolved over time in the very beginning it was it was very personal like a lot of people would be like, you know This is Whatever like often teen post and maybe like just Ariana Huffington writing blog posts and then it turns into a company and an organization But now I you see a lot of people going back to personal and I've seen a lot of big brands go from being a big company to them More so focusing on their personal brand. Yeah, because you can also You can leverage them in a lot of different ways, right? It's like you making you building your personal brand and doing a podcast around like filmmakers and creatives It then opens up to like people being more siphoned into you and it's gonna let you grow your own business more You know, yeah, it helps to uplift everything else What takeaways have you learned over the past couple years working with Gary and creating content for him That you could implement with your own because as you've been doing this your platform We started to rise you've built up an Instagram following and you're starting to see more people come yeah for the content that you create not Just yeah Yeah, so I mean that's one big thing is I try and keep like my personal Instagram and the work I do for Gary pretty separate I'm pretty subtle with like you know, I do mention like in my bio and like I do create a for Gary v and like that's sort of our only real connection I try to keep the rest somewhat separate The biggest things I've learned from a one is definitely distribution, right? The idea of like taking one piece of content and how do you take one piece of content and turn it into 50 pieces? Is been Such a massive game changer for me in terms of like whenever I do eventually step out and go do my own thing I'll know how to like get as many eyes on as possible And then a lot of stuff comes down to like life, right like the the more like motivational ask things of just like You only live once and you got to like swing the bat as hard as you possibly can to get the most out of this That's the hard thing for me is like The line between the motivational stuff because I do I love it like I wouldn't be here without Tony Robbins and all these like self-help books And like every book that I read when I was started to come up so important But then also like to to bring in the real and not be cheesy, right? Yeah, that's something that Gary does great is like it's not corny, but then like you see so many imitation Gary's out there people trying to be the next Gary V and you're like dude, you're not you're not it You're just pretending like you're you're making it. We have a thousand percent. Yeah, I think just the level of authenticity is what And people can just smell it, you know like they know when you're like saying real shit Yeah, when you admit that like you don't have it all put together Yeah, because not everybody is gonna be like that super confident like quick on their feet person like That's the thing is like everybody's trying to be the next Tim Ferriss or Gary or whatever and it's like you gotta figure out your own path and make it Yeah, I mean that's that's the funniest thing if you set out with the goal of like in this Sounds super cliche like if you set out the goal to like I'm gonna be the next Gary I'm gonna make a lot of money. I'm gonna do this like it's probably not gonna work You have to be very internal of like and that's a big thing I'm dealing with is like what am I here for like what's the best thing I'm at like the best thing I'm doing How can I make the best impact on the world how can I create the best content and it'd be authentic and like Me focusing on that is like the reason why I think it'll work you know It's gotta it's all have to have it's all comes down to like the proper intent Yeah, I think you have to do some like soul searching and really figure out What connects with you and what you want to get out there and like going back to We talked we were talking before the podcast where I was talking about my story of getting into minimalism And just like redefining your idea of success and being like all right well what would be what would success look like to me Is it like owning this company or creating this or is it like something a little bit more simple like what's the the bare minimum? I would want to get out of this and then once you achieve those goals just keep pushing yourself further You know I mean because like you're always if you're working towards your goals You're eventually gonna get there unless it's like become an astronaut or something like I'm maybe you're maybe you'll get that But like I feel you always need to be pushing yourself a little bit further How do you think like I'm just curious of your opinion when you say like you have to go soul search and everything Because that's something like it's a advice I'm giving to and then people are like, how do I do that? And I'm always like oh, I don't fucking know you know Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, it's like why's the sky blue you know, yeah, I think it's it's there's a couple things The biggest thing for me was just asking questions because a lot of times we find ourselves going down This path and Being guided there from other people by media by family by friends like all these outside influences And we said, okay, yeah, that's where I'm gonna go and that's how I felt when I just graduated even going to college and and after that It's like why am I making these decisions and then when I started to step back and be like, well, what would success look like for me? You know, how much do I actually need to be happy? Do I need a big mansion or is there something else that would be more fulfilling if I if I followed this path? So I think it starts with asking questions of yourself and the thing is that that never ends And we're always learning and we're a lot of times we're making the same mistakes and you know I try to develop mindfulness practices and meditation and stop checking my phone so much and it's like Sometimes we forget and sometimes we need to come back, but that's why I think you have to just always Continually be asking yourself and then the other thing I would say is read a lot like read a lot of books I think for me there was something about they're reading a book that was more motivating and inspiring than just watching A documentary or watching a video online as much as like well Smith is in crazy inspiring And you can watch these videos on YouTube and you think are blown away I think there's something about a book that if you're reading it over the course of a couple weeks Those kind of the ideas go a little bit further and also most people don't finish books that they start So if you can at least finish a book, there's almost an accomplishment in that and a drive to implement what you've learned into your life Yeah, I think it's funny like finding like motivational stuff like reading or something There's got to be like meet behind it like you're saying like the Will Smith like motivational like You know violin piano behind him talking is great and it like hypes you up and you're like cool But then you set there and you're like wait a second. I'm just like energized right now. There's nothing there. Yeah, yeah, I think finding things that I almost like And I don't know I go back and forth on like telling people this but Finding the people who you most want to be like or that you think are taking like similar life trajectory is people as life They're so well documented now. You can really like learn a lot about a person and sort of map your life in a similar way Yeah, and I that's I think Tim Ferris gives similar advice where he's like find people That's what he tries to do is like find like a top performance athlete or find a Bodybuilder and then figure out how they did it and then just reverse engineer to do that I think that's true. I think that you just have to make sure that that's truly the path that you want to be on Yeah, and you know everybody's a little bit different everybody circumstances so different So individual that try not to force if you feel like you're forcing this this path on top of it And it doesn't feel right then you might be off course. Yeah, I think using it is like a general like model of where you're going Like I get so many people that email me and they're like how do I get a job with Gary? And I'm like there's no answer for that because my path was like so weird and different like if there was a like a straight line to get from point A to point B Everyone would be doing the thing they want to do so it's like find like the road map But be okay with like going different places What's like the most common question that people are asking you like creators and people who are trying to be at the place that you're at now Like what are they most often ask you? I mean, I always get like technical questions of like what camera are you shooting on like what are you editing on? Which is funny because like I hate talking technicals of like photography video But yeah, I get a lot of people that are just like you know finishing school. What's the first move? And I'm just like I don't know you know like that's the tough thing because like this world So weird and strange and like creative and like content like the ground's moving so fast But I always just say like Putting out as much stuff as possible You know yeah, so this is actually something that I don't know if I could totally agree with it. My the advice that I've been giving is Make shit every day Yeah, but don't release it every day and that's the the challenge and is because You have the people that just do the daily vlogs every single day and it's like most people's lives aren't that interesting So I'm wondering if maybe since everybody's going that route everybody's running to like Shoot create post every single day or very often. It's like Maybe it's create every day, but maybe release Less often. How do you feel about that? Do you think it actually is important to release content every day to get that feedback? I think they go hand in hand, but I don't necessarily think putting stuff out every day Has to be the motto but also don't hang on to things too much. So we met with like I won't like name names But we met with a hip-hop artist recently who last year had like the biggest song like we just exploded And he debated for like months about putting it out and it almost didn't get put out and now like that person's career is in such a dramatically different place Based off one song You know so Gary will always say like your life is one piece of content away from changing like you know There might be something you you recorded the other day that you're like not fuck It's not good enough and that might be the thing that changes all of it. Hmm It's hard. Well, yeah, I've heard that actually saw that episode and the one thing that stuck with me that I'm not sure I agree with is that like Gary said that quality is subjective I just don't know if that's true Like because I I To a degree. Yes, right, but then also like if we were to look at somebody's first day filmmaking or you know I mean there's definitely a level right and a bar that you would need to pass for a stick Absolutely, I think whenever he says that he more so means like it's subjective in terms of like story is king You know, so there's been tons of pieces of content. He's made where he's you know on a flight and record something on a webcam And it's some of the most viral shit we have you know and it's like because the story is really solid there and then their day is where like Like I'll set out and be like I'm gonna make the most cinematic like swaggy piece of video we've ever made and it gets like no views Yeah, I've had the same thing where I had this video was called the new self-reliance and I'm creating this metaphor like the self-reliance Used to be like building fire I send creating shelter and all this stuff and now self-reliance is building an audience and you know creating following and all this stuff I was like I was really impressed with it. I'm like this is gonna be dope Like it's gonna be I'm like I went out into the desert and shot some footage and like I really took a lot of effort to create it and Like nothing I mean, you know, it's good compared to what I was used to be getting But like still like compared to the current traffic that I'm getting on some of my videos like it was a dud Yeah, and then I do a video in my apartment my minimalist apartment and it gets like how to squeeze Yeah, it's gonna 500,000 views and I'm like what the hell? Like but I mean it's there's I think there's a balance there right like you do want to be able to express yourself and create Where you're drawn to like if you're gut tells you like, oh, I mean, I just really want to tell that story Yeah, you probably should just follow that but then balance it with like Keep putting shit out there, you know experimenting seeing what sticks because I think a lot of times we get surprised But by like oh that one did well that song did well. I know wouldn't have guessed it Yeah, I mean the market decides everything it does yeah, I guess that's that that's the the pitch for Releasing all this time is that eventually you'll find out and nobody's watching you shit in the beginning anyway Yeah, nobody cares about what you're making. Yeah, do that's you know It's so funny you say that I think people are definitely in like the first couple years way too romantic about it It's like just like test everything. I still even now Like I'm throwing everything against the wall. Mm-hmm. You know Yeah, I might I might you might be convincing me I might like I may be going more towards that but then still I like now that I've started to build up an audience I do still feel that I like need to deliver every time right because then like I feel like if you're delivering shit Everyone's I don't know if you have too many duds. Yeah, then people will stop trusting you. Yeah. I definitely say once you do have eyes on you Like you have to be giving them what they signed up for right so that's been a biggest thing is I'm scared to go too far off like what I'm putting out every day because I'm like this is why all these people are here Like they're here because I do this thing and so I never want to go too far off that But like maybe this isn't the thing I'm best at You know like maybe if I if I shift a little bit this way like that's where The real magic happens right you know, so I don't think you can lock yourself too much into having the the day-to-day expectations of like making this thing so how do you see your content evolving your platform of evolving like what kind of stuff do you want to be Making and continuing to make and not share for yourself? I mean, so I've mentioned like the travel thing a lot There's something about like as I've started to see more of the world I think some New York's weird you get into this weird vortex of like Everyone's like you just put your head down each grind 24 seven right and I'm sure you felt that way too But then as I've started traveling more I'm like yeah, the world's really dope. I like seeing it So being able to like experience the world through a camera and like the document the travel has been a lot of fun I you know I wanted to be an actor when I was a kid so like this idea of being You know more of like a character in my content is big But yeah, I just the biggest thing I'm having an issue with now is like I'm almost too much into like the eye candy Like I'm great at like making things that visually look good, but I'm like what's the meat behind it? So that's sort of as I'm in this transition of like what's my impact on the world? Hmm, you know, and I think that's something that It's I can't just like sit down and be like all right. Let me think about it like it'll naturally come Is it evolves but I want to I want to create content that Helps one younger creators understand a little bit more how like the industry works and like how to like make moves in it And then also just I don't know push people to like live the life they're happier with yeah I love it. I feel like yeah, we're on the same path like the same kind of creation It's like making content for content creators and like I just love these kind of conversations and I find it So interesting because there's so many different paths that you can go down and we don't have Unlimited amount of time in the day so we need to figure out all right What do I really want to make and what direction do I want to head in because it's very easy to go down the wrong the wrong path? Absolutely and I love some of the videos that you're making you're doing like I've seen some of like the short form stuff that you're making Just about travel just certain ideas. Yeah, do you see so we were talking about like That kind of content creation strategy and having pillars Do you have pillars of where you see your own stuff going like is it a podcast in the video series vlog travel So I think it'll be heavily vlog influenced Sort of like the the short form things that I think we're talking about the same thing is um I would love to do longer versions of those The those were fun because I was giving myself to constraint of like all those videos We're like I wake up in the morning. I write out the script I go into the office. I record it and then I figure the video out like it's all it's they're all made with them like 12 hours I'm like just start it and like just because I was like it was it was gonna be like my Sunday project I've like just like make something for the day And those were the things that I think hit the most like I get a lot of people that are resonating with it So I want to make more of those I'm thinking about doing a podcast to about sort of like travel creators and the next wave of Creators like youtubers that you know, I think just you know kids abilities to like buy a camera and start recording their lives and like seeing the people who are like Breaking through is just absolutely bonkers These kids are dope, man Like I see some of these kids like in high school and I'm like because then when I I'm not I'm comparing them to my work now I'm not comparing them to my working high school my work in high school is garbage I'm like wow man these kids they learn they learn so quickly they just have all the tools and resources that their hands It's amazing it's insane. Yeah, so yeah, we gotta keep making shit. We got no, I know I gotta like stay on your toes Which is a good thing right absolutely I mean yeah, I love it like I love that there's like 18 19 20 year old kids that are just making shit that I think below is my stuff out of the water Yeah, no, I'm like good like I got I got to go. Yeah. Yeah. I know it's there's I'm sometimes I'm inspired by both I think you can get inspiration anywhere, but like when I see other people like younger than me that are doing amazing shit I'm like I got to I got to kick it in a high high gear. I need to keep going But then also when I see people that have a big platform big audience and they're putting out crap Or they're putting out something that I'm like, man, I could do that way better that inspires me too Because I'm like oh, okay, so it's it's not necessarily just about quality. It's about You know longevity and keep going like can you keep making shit over a long period of time? Yeah, like when you're creating your own shit and you're thinking about potentially Building this up and creating making it sustainable where you can make some money off of it Yeah, do you have ideas of how you would monetize your own content I'm going back and forth with it definitely I think like YouTube's a great way to start making stuff right away But obviously you need to have like a good following Probably I mean on like it's tough to give this advice to someone who's like just starting because I do have like a little bit of a following I'm like my Instagram and stuff like that but doing like brand partnerships and sponsorships would be the fastest way to monetize from like where I am at this exact moment Which would that's the thing that I find challenging me for me. It's it's more difficult because I put out a message of like Not anti advertising but like be really mindful about advertising and the marketing messages that you get thrown at you So that's something that I've been thinking more and more about it's like would I do any advertising on the podcast and I think obviously You need to probably should be at a certain level I don't think it would be worth it if you're not going to be making enough money to survive off of You're probably not at a point where it'd be worth it to even start You know doing advertising or posting on all these sponsorships But then it's like Sometimes people can overdo it with the sponsorships and it's like I don't know like there's there's the balance there, right? Where you don't want to be like overexposed where you're like literally promoting a product every single day on Instagram Yeah, or even every week I think you have to be like thoughtful about how yeah, I mean that's what's going to say is like again It's all comes down to authenticity right and it's like selling things that Actually like interact with your world and things you're going to use every day You know right like that you're talking about the travel bag that you use like that's easy, right? It's something you use you get value out of every day You'd be talking about it anyway, so you might as well make some money to let people know about it Yeah, I mean that's that's my biggest thing especially when you're like earlier in the game like I like quote I'm quote like I don't want to sell out and be like also toothpaste is dope Yeah, we right now I'm trying to like only push things that actually like every day affect how I'm living Right, I think that's important to have you so if you started to do that some There's a little bit. Yeah, yeah, it's it's starting to like slowly come in. How have you found that? Do they come to you or do you go to them? They're coming to me for the most part Yeah, and a lot of it's a lot of it's like early stage startups or something that just need eyeballs and so they're like sending me stuff to promote And I'm I'm very very picky with it, though. Sure What's not quite an advertisement as much as it's like they're giving you free product? Is that right or do that? It's it's more so that right now again like it was like I said earlier I'm scared to take money right now because I'm too busy. You know like like I'm scared to like say someone to say cool We're gonna pay you a thousand dollars to make a video and I'm like cool, but like I have like real life happening to yeah Your commitments so right now. It's it's a lot more like sure. I'm taking a lot of like free stuff that's being sent over and like I'm picking and choosing what I want to Interact like in everything that gets sent to me. It's funny like the travel bag was sent to me And I used it for six months before I set a word about it And then it was like oh, like I'm gonna go do this trip and then we ended up saying like, oh, let's do it together And that's how the Costa Rica that happened. Oh, cool. Is that when you met them for the first time that? Yeah, yeah That's any we we admit like you know briefly and we like done some phone calls and stuff and then the guy who owns the company It was like fuck it like I'm trying to come with you and now we're like best friends. Yeah, I feel like if I ever do that It would definitely be It's something you have to actually trial and run and use and like there's definitely as a thing so it's so challenging like the To be at a stance where you're like I will not put ads on my podcast or I'm not gonna use any kind of advertisements Like obviously there's other ways to get creative to create courses digital products books whatever it is But at the same time, I'm like if there are digital products that I use and I use a list of them that I pay for that are Amazing and they help me with my business and prioritize and organize my life. Yep It's like what what is so wrong about promoting them and getting some money for it? Yeah, I don't know It's like it's the world we live in I'm battling is now it's funny because there's probably podcasts that have recorded that I'm like I don't think I've ever actually said like I will never do advertising But at the same time the more I get into it and the more work I put into it and the fact that this is the full-time job of creating content You're like there's gotta be some ways to make it Make it make that work yeah make these sponsorships work. I think it's funny too because like as creatives Like money tends to at least for myself like money's definitely a back burner thing like I'm like I just want to like create stuff And so anytime money gets involved I like kind of like get nervous and freak out and I'm like how do I like ask for money in terms of things That I would have made regardless, you know like like I just want to make stuff You know and so like that's always tough like I'm getting ready to put out my first like light room like photo show action pack And I'm like nervous about it, you know, I'm like right talk like I don't like I would just give these away for free Yeah, you know and sort of be like no like they're worth this and I don't like it's tough It is tough and I think it's something that you you've you've got to embrace and That's the only way to continue to make it as a creative I mean, that's the thing that I saw as like a lot of people really on they they were Incredibly talented filmmakers photographers designers, but then they just gave up because they couldn't turn it into a business They couldn't make money off of it and like money You got to get paid to make your art and I do I think that we can be very we should be very thoughtful about it because like it just gets annoying to And you can certainly hurt your integrity if You are selling shit constantly and you're always asking from something from your audience You're always asking them they go somewhere click something do something instead of just saying here's something You know here's a piece of content that you might like yeah, I mean, it's one of those like funny things Gary Said the land one time where he was asked someone asked me about like I'm a starving artist And he's like yeah, like starving artists are starving artists because they think of themselves as artists You know, but if you flip it and you're like I'm a business man and I business as I sell art Everything changes. It's all about a perspective of how you look at the world Yeah, it's just how you're approaching creativity, right? Yeah, because it's like you still have to pay rent Yeah, you know, this is back to this this is a real world man We got to make shit happen and we got to we got to eat yeah, we don't want those peanut butter and sandwiches every That's terrible I would really like haven't had a peanut butter and jelly sandwich in like two years because it was just I burned out So yeah, that was yeah very early on for me dollar menu was everything like Wendy's dollar menu Not Wendy's McDonald's, but like just any of those like cheap fast food places It's just like but it's also hard I would tell people if you can do rice and beans do you know there's other ways that eat a little bit health I mean yeah when you have like the parachute of youth It's a little bit more okay, but yeah, I mean like your health will go to shit quick True, I've noticed that man as you get older you're like my body doesn't respond in the same ways that it used to All right, cool. Let's do quick questions and then we'll finish this podcast up Um What book if you read much has had the biggest impact on your life the up-schools the way by Ryan hold it Ryan hold it right he's a Canadian is that right or is he? Where's he from he's he's right a few books. Yeah. Yeah, so he uh it's he's big on like stoic philosophy Honestly, so I have to the process tattoo and then momentum more which I got in Costa Rica on that trip Or both like very like stoic philosophy thinking is that came the process specifically came from the up-schools the way And the up-schools the way is a big one because it's like just accepting things that Jump in your way of like getting to your goal and how to turn them into positives So it's it's funny walking out of the office the day that I was told I didn't have a job I crushed through the up-schools the way and like 12 hours and like it completely changed the way I thought about it I think that book is why I emailed Gary and said yo, let's like me. Wow, that's amazing So I owe that book a lot You know, it's cool thing just about doing podcasts and this kind of content is that like You get to a point where then you could reach out to Ryan holiday and be like hey, what's up man? I want to do this and that and that's one of like the greatest that's you know, it's funny you say that because uh So recently actually probably not recently more probably about a year ago I was like walking through the office. It was like a Saturday afternoon and I saw a copy of it on someone's desk And so I picked it up and like took a picture of it and like gave a little bit of the story behind that and the tattoo and Ryan reached out to me Yeah, and so we ended up like meeting up in New York You take for a couple hours. Yeah. Oh, that's so cool man. Yeah. I love that dude When you look at your work and and what you do What do you think drives you? Well, like what drives you to Work those six months day and night to put in work on your own stuff on the weekend Why do you keep making shit? That's a good question I don't know like it's it's super like it's an internal thing I'm really bad at sitting still like I'm not good at like relaxing and I think that When you find something that you love and you're good at and it like is a way to make you like make money You just have to get so like laser focused and I just feel like I won the lottery honestly like the fact that like I'm 24 and like every day feels like just fun and it's like that's my life It's like why would I slow down for anything? Why do you have yeast? What am I happiest When I'm out like creating just for myself like just doing trips that are like No real goal no expectation of like what's gonna come out of it just like let's put myself out of my comfort zone in a new place and just see what happens Couple more questions here. Where do you go when you're feeling down? Super in my head. I will literally put on music and walk through the city for just hours and I'll just like really see you do that quite a bit Yeah, yeah, and that's one of my biggest things so walking through New York at night Like listening to just like instrumental beats is like my happy place of like whenever like shit's not clicking right my head And I'll literally just go out and just talk to myself and just like for like hours like I'll like go off This is like overnight wow and just like figure it out So instrumental hip hop. Yeah, you laid out some bars in your head, too That's a good one. Yeah, there's I still owe my audience a freestyle rap because I had right now Do it because I had Ellie Ashford on the podcast He dabbles will wrap and he's a filmmaker at hot 97 on New York and He spit like just it was a mate. It was like on the post show. He just dropped these bars I was like damn, that's good. I thought I could actually Bring something but I'm like this is embarrassing. I'm not so there's Is that me this into your big like hip hop person? Yeah, I love hip hop. I mean, I'm not like a hip hop head We know like you know everything inside and out, but it's like definitely Hip hop has been like the primary genre of music that I listened to and then every once in a while Kind of shy away from it, but yeah, that's been cool actually. I had Ashara on the podcast love Ashara Yeah, Ashara was the man dude. He Because I actually connected with him early on in Philly and then made I made some videos with him and he just happened to be through LA and Just kind of had him on but I'm like do that's why I want more of if I could just get more rappers on the podcast I'm like it's just so cool to be able to meet people that Like you Respect and appreciate their work and you're interested in what they do and be able to just kind of just the chat I mean just having a conversation with you. It's like that's what it's all about it's like honestly like If this podcast doesn't grow or become a thing that alone is an enjoyable part of the process Yes, it can it allows you to build up that network, right? Like Even if like the podcast doesn't do what you want to do you still have those connections? Yeah, like 100 episodes you made a hundred people and you know who knows where those things will lead to and like I guarantee there's probably going to be a big project that stems from just a podcast interview 100% what's the simplest advice that's the most important to follow There's this bank's equal. There's nothing more common in the world than unsuccessful people with talent So leave the house before you find something worth staying for I usually just like hold on to the back half of it But I think that you can easily get complacent in the world and like just go with like the safe route And potentially miss out on like what your real calling is So that's the thing that floats around my head most hello that and I think we should just end the podcast on that All right Cool, so if people want to connect with you online Where should we send them Instagram's definitely the best place right now, which is at Babin be a b i n Tyler Babin on youtube TylerBabin.com One of those I check them all pretty often, so Cool brother.
