## Transcript
 It got in the way of everything meaningful in my life. Minimalism showed up at the time for me where it felt like I got into those two car crashes. My marriage ended, my mother died both in the same month. And it realized, no, I wasn't very contented with what I was doing for my corporate career. And it's not that I hated it, but it was comfortable. It was a six out of ten. And that was actually part of the problem. But it got in the way of everything meaningful in my life. My health, my relationships. I wasn't writing like I wanted to write. I wasn't creating how I wanted to create. I certainly wasn't contributing in a meaningful way. But I was making a good income. I had a nice house. I had several Lexuses. And so you get to this point where you are comfortable and you're afraid to lose that comfort. And then it was a way for me to realize that that comfort was a bit of a facade. And comfort was getting in the way of what I considered to be meaningful.
