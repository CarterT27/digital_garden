## Transcript
 Alright, so I caught myself thinking something completely ridiculous this morning and I'm guessing that you've had similar thoughts before. I thought to myself, I can't make really beautiful videos because I don't have a creative space to shoot them in. It started with me thinking about the studios that my friends and mentors work from, open spaces, natural light, brick walls, shelves filled with colorful books, maybe even a library ladder. Now that would make for a really cool video backdrop. So I started the daydream about this ideal or perfect production studio in my mind. It started to form into a must-have. Eventually I snapped back to reality. I realized what I was doing. This is the myth of I don't have. I don't have this, so I can't do that. I don't have a professional camera so I can't take great photos. I don't have the right running shoes so I can't go for that jog or that run. I don't have a Canon 50mm 1.2 prime lens so I can't shoot that interview. It's a form of resistance and it's holding you back from doing your very best work. These thoughts, they just creep in when you least expect them to. And as far as I know, there's no immediate cure, except ignoring your monkey mind and just doing the work anyway. It might not be ideal for the short term. You might eventually get that 50mm prime lens down the road. But it is vitally important that you continue to put in the work anyway. Be critically aware of every one of these excuses that creeps into your mind, push it to the side, and get to work. So resistance comes in all shapes and sizes. It can be very tricky and it can be very persuasive. This morning I was thinking about the production studio, but I also had another one that kind of invaded my thoughts. And it was, you're going to laugh, but it was, oh my shirt that I want to wear during this video is in clean. So I guess I'm not going to record the videos today. I swear to you, this is a thought that I had, it's the saddest excuse of all time. And what did I do? I did the laundry. And I was, because I still was going to wear that shirt. But I wasn't going to let that excuse hold me back. So I did the laundry. And then while I was doing the laundry, I set up all this video stuff. I prep my script. I figured out what I wanted to say. And then I sat down. And then by the time that I was ready to shoot the video, I'm sure it cleaned. So, in an amendment to the video, clean your shirt and get to work.
