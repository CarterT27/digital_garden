I appreciate you having me. Thank you so much for coming on This was so last second. So you literally texted me this morning and you're like you want to grab a drink And I said you want to come on my podcast And that's where we are right now I'm glad that we can make this work me too, man. I did not see this coming when I woke up this morning in Austin, Texas I found out that you moved to LA When I landed in a plane in LA, which was which was cool and I'm very happy that we're here now I tried to get you on the podcast in New York when I was still doing it out there But I feel like whenever you're traveling you're somewhere for a day or two and it's just very tight to fit into the schedule Especially last second. So this is this is gonna be good because you have a very interesting life You were a professional wrestler turned dating coach turned Spartan plan Creator there's a lot that I want to unpack and talk about but before we we we do get into kind of your journey and and where you got started out Tell me and the audience a little bit about your current work and and what you do both the nine to five Work that you do as well as the passion projects. I'm gonna sound like a Joe Rogan fanboy here But I like to base what I do off of his career model, which I call sort of a hybrid career a lot of people Out there in the interwebs are big on Entrepreneurship do that and nothing else and that's fine, right? That helps people make some incredible things I'm into building my own side projects, but I don't necessarily think there's anything wrong with working for people If you're doing something that lights you on fire, so my day job I run the student outcomes department for a coding program called Hacker actor and that student Outcomes just a fancy word for the career services department. So I manage a team of 11 career coaches that we help at any given time. We're coaching about 400 Software engineers to help guide them into a career and these are folks who are very new to the industry So they're scared and you know, they need some advice on how to get to that next level and that's what my team and I do So I feel Like it would be foolish of me to say I got to get out of this day job, man It's so cool why I get to help people isn't that like that that's what people typically think and and especially with millennials and younger people And even part of the minimalist movement and people that talk about it a lot of it can be It can sound anti nine to five anti job, which is like everybody needs a job everybody needs to make a living and Sometimes they're deeply fulfilling jobs exactly and you know Everyone's on a different part of their journey So you might not be in a job that that is exciting is what I get to do I understand I've had jobs that were horrible But the the idea was to always have a plan for how I was going to get to the next spot in my life continue to grow And so you know, I It sounds cheesy, but you have to pay or do sometimes some people have more opportunities than others So you do that as your your main 95 and then what are some of At least the the passion projects that you're working on right now. Yes, so you mentioned Spartan plan So I have a background in coaching in a number of different realms career coaching dating advice but also fitness coaching and And Spartan plan it's going to sort of be a combination of all of those things I suspect the part where people will Register most is is fitness just because it's called Spartan plan But the idea behind Spartan plan is more based on simplicity of of the methods that I employ So you don't need An incredibly fancy plan to to become successful in a given thing at least not normally You're likely familiar with paratos principle the the 80 20 rule the the 20% of stuff you do that gets you 80% of the results So I like to break Complicated things down and make them simple not necessarily easy, but simple And that is probably a big part of why you and I ever met through the minimalists I also work with them on their mentorship page That's where I get a lot of my one-on-one clients which is very helpful for sort of building out larger Systems to help bigger groups of people yeah, it's funny the the first time I met you It was at a point in my life where I was pushing myself out of my comfort zone and and doing something that was terrifying because I was Putting money and paid work and everything I've been working towards on the side It's to work on this documentary minimalism and one of the first nights. We say to your place You kind of have instant connection with people where I'm like, oh, this is a cool dude. I feel like we're gonna get along I knew right away When we hugged That's a good hug whenever I hang out with Josh and Ryan because they hug everybody I feel like I too have to start hugging people, but it's always kind of weird because I'm holding a camera Usually you don't want to be the asshole that doesn't have sorry. I'm just gonna shake your hand here Yeah, it can be you do you have to go with the flow and it works out most at the time But yeah, let's go back to I guess where do you want to start where does your story start? Where does it start? Question. So I grew up in Cleveland, Ohio and I guess really it starts the the part that gets interesting in juicy with the dating stuff I was married at a young age got married at 23 to my high school sweetheart Only adult relationship I never had and Gosh like three days after my step mom's funeral my ex-wife asked for a divorce And As you might imagine, it was pretty painful for me to to deal with really two massive losses at the same time And I was supposed to go to couples counseling with my ex, but she didn't show up So it just turned into me counseling The counselor I asked hey look, I'm I'm really depressed right now I don't think it's a chemical Sort of in balance I understand that there's some some massive blows that I've taken in the past few weeks and I'm curious What what advice do you have for me to try to get through this as soon as possible? And she said well the the three things that stand out to me would be Make sure that you're exercising and now at the time most professional wrestler Did she look at you? Well, he's my job. That's her size. That's probably 50 pounds heavier with just muscle And she's like eat right. I'm like check. Yeah, and then she says And when you're ready Go on dates Nothing serious you don't have to don't go sleep around or anything like that But you should see that other people are interested in getting to know you and that your life can go on after this relationship And I thought to myself well, I don't even know how to do that. I met my ex wife when I was 17 24 at the time that she's asking for the divorce So I'm I'm kind of up a creek without a paddle and I wish I wish that I could say that I found the the pickup artist community where I'm going to read the game and all these other books That's how I found it. I mean, I ultimately read that stuff But I didn't know it was out there and I was sort of an internet novice so I just grabbed a pen and paper and went to bars and started taking notes on stuff that was seen And That is the dorky Yeah, yeah, it was pretty bad. Yeah, and then occasionally people would ask me what I was doing and that made it even worse It's super creepy. I think you kicked out of the bar I got kicked out of a few bars, but yeah, that's okay Anyway, I started learning and before long someone By happened stance this guy I went to high school with who will remain nameless saw what I was doing recognize me from the wrestling world and was like You're trying to learn to talk to women aren't you Yeah, I am and and I'm talking to him a little one and I go how did you know and he goes well? I'm here teaching someone to talk to women and We ended up developing a relationship He sort of took me under his wing like an apprentice and I was in the process of moving back to my hometown and Cleveland I was living in Georgia and he let me crash with him for like three months and And just work on that which I don't recommend don't do that That idea. Yeah, it's but it was sort of the the thing that That made it possible for me to Offer that skill set to other people because I was Sort of in a very unhealthy way obsessed with it for a while what was so bad about it was it did the living with this guy for three months and just working on nothing but online dating It was The nothing but isn't necessarily what was bad because I love Deep diving into things in fact I'm a big believer in the idea that you should find just a few things that that really said you on fire and forget Everything else and do those few things make them your super power So it wasn't so much that but it was the fact that I was using that to sort of nurse the pain of the loss of my stepmother and my wife And it I've never been into drinking or we're doing drugs or anything like that but this became my vice And so whenever I was feeling alone or insecure or whatever the case may be I would try to Get someone to show me affection and and that's not healthy. That's not what That's not the grounds for a strong relationship. So walk me through that journey that Three-month plus journey of becoming a would you call yourself a pickup artist At the time it's such a such a bad word. No. I I I guess we could just say dating coach And now it would be more like a behavior modification specialist It started with him teaching me to approach people and and this is I think particularly useful for anyone listening Regardless of the relationships status What I've learned is that people Are afraid of taking that first step so in the dating world it would be approaching someone starting the conversation But maybe in your career it's it's going to this networking event or for you Taking that dive and making the documentary that you feel passionate about and people like to Like to think about all the what ifs what if this happens what if would if would if I approach this woman and she throws her hot coffee in my face or What if I what if I make this documentary and it fails and I end up homeless on the street We we like to think up every possible what if scenario because one It gives us a sense of certainty and people like to act when they feel certain but two and this is the bigger one It makes us feel like we're being productive when we're not being productive We're not actually moving forward and I needed to learn that lesson sort of the hard way So he would set Requirements on how many people I had to approach per day it was more Hey man, you have to go start a conversation with 15 people today and If you don't you don't get the sleep on my couch That's a big reward to hold over somebody's head yeah or or a punishment right? Yeah. Yeah I tend to respond better to the stick than the carrot got you and most people do Once the the pain of in action becomes greater than the pain or potential pain of action That's where people start to move and so for me that helped Get me moving that by no means was I a Casanova or night and my wife will tell you that I'm I'm still not But it helped me get out of my shell when I when I help people with career advice there The easiest part of the process is to apply for the job and yet it's the part people don't do The most like they they're afraid to apply because they think well, what if this what if they find me out? That's the big one Career dating anything What if they find out that I'm faking it and you're you're probably not faking it is the funny thing I don't think you were but but I wouldn't doubt that most most successful people still have that same feeling They just don't let it affect their action. Yeah, the imposter syndrome and this is something that I talk about a lot in the podcast I think A lot of it the core comes down to doubt and we just have so much doubt and I continue to have so much doubt about any big or new or scary Project that I work on and it's I'm constantly curious as how people get through doubt So how did you in those? Let's just say it specifically those moments there where you're failing miserably and you probably have so much doubt What is it that got you through those early mistakes this is gonna sound cheesy as hell But around that time I was also deeply studying Zen Buddhism I'm not religious I wasn't that neither but I thought it would be a nice framework by which to lead my life And it helped me in a number of ways but one of the big ways was it it made me very conscious of the fact that No matter what happens I'm gonna fucking die Yeah, and it doesn't matter how safe I play it What am I trying to avoid when I avoid the risk? Oh, I could be end up homeless on the street. Oh, okay Why does that worry you? Well people won't like me. Oh, okay. Why does that worry you? It ultimately comes down to this fear of self annihilation But once you accept that that's gonna happen no matter what then like I have this sort of This sort of it's not a mantra, but I like to think to myself It's okay because you're gonna die so don't worry Like most people worry they're gonna die go don't worry You will die I in a lot of ways That's very comforting it reminds me of this book. I believe it's called no death no fear By that knit yon and I just probably screwed up every part of the his name as well as the book But it was it's that similar sentiment that once you can get over death You can get over fear and you can really do anything from there What were like you're into this self development stuff like I am what's the cornyest thing that you've ever done? Like you talk about Montres and I have certainly done that where you recite things into the mirror like what's the cornyest shit you've done? Oh man, I've done that I will tell you a thing I still do that is incredibly corny and I tell all of my clients and all of my students to do it I call it a daily reprogramming so I don't necessarily Sit on a cushion and meditate the way I did in your past but I feel like with with all the the media that's out there were plugged in the internet all the time There's all these conflicting messages that are coming into our minds and it's easy to get distracted and not stay on a particular path that you have chosen. So what I do is I like to have a daily reprogramming I wrote out Manifesto about all the things that are important to me and all of the things I need to ignore that will inevitably happen throughout my day and I read that out loud on my iPhone and then I set it up to be my alarm at random times So loudly that's really neat. I like that and it's so cheesy but whenever I hear it I get fired up and I don't even have to let it play all the way like today I was in the middle of a business meeting and it started playing and it it starts off with you are crew Specks oh my god, just a gasey forget it's like my mentor love for self development Yeah, that's a that's a really clever way to keep yourself on track because I just talked about this in my last podcast is How do you stay on track and oftentimes I try to set habits like meditation or waking up early and then I fall off track and then I think that is part of the journey And nobody's perfect and there will be times when we fall out of our workout routines But it's like how do you pull yourself back into it which is so important With the the dating coaching I asked you for advice Early on this was this was probably a couple of years ago before I met my current girlfriend Natalie I wanted a little bit of advice and guidance because I was starting to get nervous after coming out of a relationship for maybe a two-year relationship I was nervous about putting myself back out there and I didn't know what was the first step I should take and I had forgot and everything I had learned about dating and then I remember you tell me just some crazy shit like just ask people Like go run up to a stranger and tell them that you need to take a shit and that You need the closest bathroom and if they could direct you to it, that would be great I forget the technical term for that, but we'll call it fear chasing And I had just started experimenting with that for people who had anxiety about starting conversations with strangers And it kind of goes back to what we were talking about they had all these what ifs And they thought about all the horrible things that could happen and so what I tried to do was to manufacture Those horrible things way worse than The real world would ever create and then this way they could sit in that feeling and Experience it and my thought was the It's a cheesy quote from Ralph Waldo Emerson the do the thing that you fear and the death of fear is certain And so if you're afraid of them finding you out or if you're afraid of being shamed publicly Chase that fear experience it and stay in it So the telling them that you have diarrhea and you know holding your asshole and running up to them or Or You know just walking up and saying embarrassing things about yourself to people is that Healthy, I don't know I'm not as ecologist But it tends to be funny for the people you're talking to it like I would never have someone say something that offends the person you're approaching It's never about Be littering anyone else It's if you can make a joke about yourself and they know you're joking usually They have a good time about it and then you start to get into a state of mind where Failure is no longer something you're afraid of does it last forever Fuck no, but if you're thinking Maybe it's not dating maybe you're about to go to this networking thing for your job and you're feeling really nervous Have some weird conversations with strangers talk about some weird shit that you don't talk about anybody and You're gonna have a much easier time talking about Mundane work type stuff in fact You'll probably be the life of the party because you'll be talking on a bunch of other weird stuff that people don't dare speak of There came a point where I just got fed up with boring conversation and I'd rather just say something that might be a little bit Fensive that might cross the line because it's gonna probably lead to an interesting conversation and if you get offended by it Then you're probably not the kind of person that I'd want to talk to anyway that that advice really helped me out a lot And I remember Even before I met my ex and when I just started to get back into dating It was that Fear and anxiety that was in a lot of ways crippling I remember you said you had something very similar when you like you first approach that you ever had Oh, man. Yeah Let's see if I can remember this correctly. I remember the outcome for sure I Was supposed to say something silly To to these these women that was what the my mentor had told me to say He said I want you to go up to them and you start a conversation however you want but at some point You need to mention them that you just you just fucking love fruity pebbles and you would love nothing more Then to sit in a bathtub full of fruity pebbles and and eat fruity pebbles with them So I do love fruity pebbles who doesn't so But I go and I'm nervous about approaching them so I'm just kind of like not even willing to do it And the guy who's my mentor is 285 pounds six foot five semi pro MMA fighter to put in perspective Picks me up straight arm and Walks me over to them because I'm unwilling to go do this I'm unwilling to chase the fear he plops me down in front of them He says this this is my friend crew. He wants to talk to you And He says go on crew and and to their credit these women are like oh hi crew and they're waiting for a pleasant conversation And I start crying like not like Like water in my eye like tears running down my face and I kind of like whimper out what he said to say because I knew I wouldn't have a place to sleep that night unless I did But it was interesting because then I wanted to leave right I was I felt ashamed And Not only did he physically not let me leave because you wanted me to sit in the fear and an experience the thing that I was afraid of But the women didn't want me to leave and not because they were like oh yeah I want to jump this guy's bone It wasn't that it was compassion they were like oh something's wrong like this guy seems like a normal person He's crying about fruity pebbles. That's not normal But then we started having a real conversation about where I was in my life They started opening up about where they were in their lives it ended that night. It was just a it was actually a very pleasant conversation in the end but You know, I was very thankful for that fear chasing that he forced me into and I would start to do more things like that not with the cheesy fruity pebble stuff But you know whenever I found myself in something uncomfortable I would just sit in it. I did it actually is a little kid. I used to be afraid that When my so my dad likes beer and I think a lot of kids dealt with this where the doubt would be like go get me a beer My dad kept the beer in the fridge that was in the basement and I was always afraid that aliens We're gonna get me of course And I remember this one day I was like aliens have not gotten me yet I'm gonna just turn the lights off and stand here for a few seconds and if the aliens want to get me They can but I'm gonna get over this and so it's like I always think of that when I tell people just sit here in the fear and Recognize that nothing is happening to you hiring a dating coach hiring somebody to help you Find love Is sometimes look that look down upon and I'm just curious There's this whole world of People who teach others How to get women or how to meet men What's Wrong about it and what's right about it like in your mind because there's an entire industry here for people Helping people find love so in your mind where do you see where it's going right and where do you see where sometimes it can actually How hurt the the first thing so you mentioned that it can be sort of a It's one of those things that not a lot of people are comfortable even approaching it even if they feel like they need it What I find is so I've come full circle to the point where the majority of people that I help with dating advice are women And I find that they're far more forthcoming about hey I could use some pointers on how to do a better job with this whereas I think perhaps just because of the societal norms that people put on with like gender roles Men feel inferior if they need help with this thing So there's that where men are less likely to Come for help in an environment that is healthy so then you do see them going on these forums where they're taking advantage of women and in these sorts of things and I'm not about that Unequivocally it's not just a cheesy thing that I say on in public but then when you work with me and like all right, bro I'm gonna show you the real stuff. No, that's not it And that's part of the problem is is people are sort of Looking to this to do what I did at first and and use it as a crutch for something that's missing in their life So while I'm always keen on making sure that the person is in a good place emotionally before I will even help them There's a client or I worked with just recently who we uncovered after an hour and half session that While there was a lot of things that she could do to Create the relationship she wanted She wasn't there yet she was still too fresh from her breakup and I said hey look, let's let's just pause You can come back whenever I'm not going anywhere But it doesn't make sense for me to force you into something you're not ready for and a lot of coaches Have this one size fits all approach I used to work for a company where I was one of many coaches and they had this Approach that hey all guys want to get women into that that's the goal In fact, we're going to give you a bonus if that will happen and I didn't like that But not only because it just didn't seem right to me, but also it didn't make sense business-wise I remember working with this client who had been He had come to Austin for a week to work with us for 10 hours a day He didn't get to me until the last day last session and My manager's like hey man he hasn't taken a woman home all week you are a last hope for this to be a successful client And so I say all right well, let me you know I'll go meet with him and talk to him As we're as we're talking I'm not really thinking about what they're telling me to do in management I just want to get to know this guy And so I say hey man you've been here for about a week now How are you enjoying this experience? He's like this is this has been the most transformative experience of my life first and foremost I'm a devout Christian and I have no interest in having sex until I'm married I wanted to come here to improve my social skills learn to make friends with people and I've been doing that This has been great and I said wonderful. Let's keep doing it and and that was no longer Had anything to do with what we were working on it was what do you need? I'm gonna find you where you are and try to help you get where you want to be and what I've found Is even the guys who are like yeah, bro I want to go hook up with a bunch of chicks most of them don't want that they think they want that because that's what society tells them to but inevitably They're they're looking for something more emotionally gratifying whether that's One guy one girl one girl one girl one guy whatever multiple people in the end they want something that's honest And is benefiting everyone involved we didn't get to talk about I don't think we talked about professional wrestling Did we didn't tap into that at all and and and no pun intended in terms of tapping in but I do want to talk about that Actually because one of my big goals on the show is to get the rock That I'm that's my huge stretch goal is to have the rock on the show and interview him about his story I'm sure you know a lot about the rock like such an inspiring guy When did you first start getting into wrestling? So I always want wrestling with my papaw growing up when I was very little and I I never thought I would Do that one I don't know if you can tell I'm not very big not not a big dude And so it didn't seem like a realistic thing but I enjoyed it and my father was always into martial arts So he he taught me a lot of those and I so I did like real martial arts and I got into drama club Was a drama geek and I had a friend who found this gym that would let us rent out now 15 years old right with let us rent out their pro wrestling ring By the hour and we could put on our little show in front of no one and I was all about it. I was like hell. Yeah. I'm gonna do that So I brought a microphone and an amplifier and I wrote up this this promo that I was gonna give And I did some martial arts and a little bit of acrobatics. There was horrible and I finished I sit down to watch my buddies go and and this guy approaches me mad dog Manson He's at the time at least he was probably like six three 400 pounds Bald head big beard scary guy Hey, you're pretty funny Thank you sir. You ever think about doing this? Well, yeah, but I'm 125 pounds Yeah, well, you can eat a lot of food and lift weights That doesn't stop nobody. I'm like oh, yeah, I guess you're right So anyway, they end up signing me to a developmental deal that my father signed off on so After high school I would go to pro wrestling school five days a week for about four or five hours and I learned the business And I was fortunate that I was able to do training camps with guys who ended up making it to the WWE guys like CM Punk and guy who's known as cashiest oh-no now and No, I don't like in us and some others, but that that sort of gave me opportunities that I wouldn't have and it really was my first exposure to coaching in the way that I do and Yeah, I know it's a cool job. That's pretty amazing to have that in your background That you were a professional wrestler and I saw some of the videos, man Look legit and it was uh I feel like you can only do that when you're young too because like there is a Certain threshold the body can take as you get older when I get out of bed My joints make a lot of noises and my wife likes to say when I grow up I want to be a pro wrestler Because she just imagines me saying that when I was young and now I'm like Yeah, it's not gonna work anymore when did you decide to Stop wrestling was there a moment where it just wasn't working or there was a better opportunity for you So I moved to Austin a little over seven years ago and I had been sort of at the peak of my wrestling at that point and the Cleveland was where I was based And a few things happened all at once. There was a guy who was one of my mentors named JT Lightning who at the time He was suffering from late-stage cancer. He's passed away now, but He he had always been sort of a driving force and I had made some some supplement choices that weren't Particularly healthy that were injectables and He started getting me to think about like hey man, what's gonna happen after this? What about your body? What about having a family? And I knew I was moving to Texas and my promoters had some contacts within the WWE and they said hey man You're about 200 pounds now, so you're starting to be big enough to go there I could get you some tryouts and I knew it was sort of at a Kind of a crossroads like I can keep doing this and maybe maybe I'll look out and if I work hard enough I can get to where I don't know that I would be ever be as famous as the rock, but I could make a good living at this Or I could try to do something else and at the time it was doing the dating stuff as well And I had some friends in the wrestling business who were saying You know, it's great up here the WWE's awesome But there's a lot of stuff you don't see that's not glamorous the traveling the You know getting beat up even worse than you do on the independent scene and so I made a conscious decision when I moved to Austin to sort of Re-invent myself and I never leave Pro Wrestling as I'm sure whenever you interview Dwayne and you will it's gonna happen He'll tell you like once you're a pro wrestler you're always a pro wrestler. It's a brotherhood But at that time I decided hey, it's time to stop punching people in the face for a living And something else What advice do you have for me in terms of getting the rock on the podcast because I haven't made much progress This is episode This is episode 25 of the ground up show so far I met What the only progress I've had is that I met somebody that has his assistance and business partners Contact information so I got emails and I got a couple phone numbers which is really exciting and I haven't done anything with them yet Because maybe I'm waiting you know There's that balance between I feel like I should just Just do it just reach out, but then at the same time I'm like I feel like I need to build a strong case for it because of Court this is like if you're going to approach a girl the rock is like the hottest girl on the planet and like how do you approach this person? What kind of material do I bring? How do I sell him on coming on to this podcast that gets about at this point a thousand downloads in episode Which is like, you know, I'm really excited about that. I don't think the rock is good It's gonna incentivize the rock to come on the show. So first I if people take anything away from this episode I want them to take away that the rock is the prettiest girl in the world Yeah, I'm sure he'll appreciate that. I think he will I have a few ideas one. I think you're already doing the right thing by connecting with people who are connected to the rock or to Wayne Johnson That helps I would say you don't have to wait until all of your ducks are in a row It's sort of like the approach anxiety thing. I was talking about really, but what if what if I'm not big enough? All right, do you think he'll remember you think of how many yeah think of how many times he gets contacted for interviews? That he can't do because it's just a busy dude He probably doesn't remember all the times he's rejected people which means you can try again. That's a good one And before long, maybe he will remember you. I'm gonna be like Who's this Matt dude? Yeah, and I mean the guy has a I'm sure has a place in L.A. So there may be a time where it is convenient for him and While there may not be the type of listeners The the type of audience that he's used to speaking in front of you might find Something that motivates him maybe it's a cause that he believes in Or it's a friend that you helped of his and he wants to get back From what I get I mean, I don't know the guy, but from what I gather he seems very genuine and I think that if you can Touch that nerve something that he really cares about that you share and it works communally for his insane schedule It probably happened and don't stop that's the key because it might not happen tomorrow Yeah, but it might happen just a year just wait outside of his apartment No, I feel like that that's really good advice I think that the thing that I'm getting out of this is that I need to put a lot of effort into it And I really need to dive deep and think about what's gonna connect and appeal to the rock and I think part of that is going to be making some kind of video That reaches out to him as well as getting people listening to the ground-up show right now to tweet at the rock to Start to at least put it in his his world if I get everybody listens to show right now to tweet at the rock and say hey Go up go on Matt the of all is the ground-up show. I feel like we can start to get there even if it's like five tweets Worst case scenario you could just get a lot of chloroform. I could do that. It's gonna have to be a lot because he's a big guy I bring down and then you have to worry about does the rock have bodyguards? That's a good question He probably does I mean and they probably got guns because I feel like the rock has enough Personal power that he doesn't need to bring any extra muscle I feel like it depends when you catch him because I see on his Instagram sometimes he takes pictures with people in his truck Yeah, by himself. He's by himself Yeah, it sounds really creepy. It sounds like I'm gonna like do something Where the FBI's gonna start tracking me and and making sure that I'm not a crazy person You know stalking is the most sincere form of flattery. I'm gonna quote you on that when I go to trial So I appreciate that that's really good advice and I'm gonna take that to heart and I'm gonna I'm gonna do it before I think I'm ready for it. So I'm gonna start mapping out the plan Now and then within the next couple of weeks. I'm gonna start rolling some stuff out So thank you for that advice from dating coaching Where does your life go from there? You still do a bit of coaching as well. I need to do a lot of coaching Most of what I do now is career advice When I find and I don't I don't necessarily talk about the two You know when I'm working with someone in dating they don't know me as a career coach and typically the the people I work with in the career coaching world They don't know that I've worked as a dating coach But they often recognize that those skill sets sort of go hand in hand because you're you're selling yourself to people Is what you're doing Whether you're trying to get a job or Investing if someone will invest in you or a romantic relationship It's all about getting them to see the value and this is sort of what we were talking about with the rock is Looking at what's going on in their mind? What would motivate them? What value could I offer them that would make them interested in in doing this and That's that's an important place to come from you. Don't want to come from what I need what do I need from them? Instead it should be what can I offer them? Mm-hmm and Whether or not I get something in return just first offer something to them And people are worried about scarcity for some reason they think Man if I if I offer too much value in this interaction, I could lose big because I'm investing and maybe they'll just take what I've given and offer nothing back But if you're offering things that are not physical, right? You're not spending a bunch of money It's limitless You can offer your experiences your conversation these sorts of things and As far as why those sort of intersect Think about a first date and a first interview They're kind of the same thing a date is just an interview for a romantic partner To see like do they check off on all the all lists do we get along you Get used to certain conversation threads anyone who's been on enough first dates or enough First interviews knows that there's only so many different types of conversations you can have And if you're aware of that you start to be able to sort of plan for those conversations Now this is where it gets sketchy because some people are worried about But it's not serendipitous Mm-hmm, but nothing is serendipitous once you're an adult. Let's be real Even if you've never gone to a dating coach and if you've had great relationships and you knock every interview out of the park If you're being honest with yourself, you know that there are things you have said in multiple interviews or in multiple dates You have a background in in comedy, right? When someone watches a comedian stand-up comic Let's say it's an hour set now if you're an audience member It it's one hopefully funny, but two it sounds like it's all off the top of their head But you and I both know that's not the case. Yeah, and I think the most interesting people to look at Louis C.K talks about it where every Single gesture um, uh Well, I forgot what was I talking about everything is scripted everything is a built into it Obviously there are moments where they might talk to somebody in the crowd But even a lot of crowdwork Once you hit a certain point, what do you do for a living boom? There are certain things that they can jump into and transition out of that It's so much more of it is scripted than I think people realize And it's just as enjoyable absolutely and it's not like people don't know that they know at least to some degree It's scripted. It's like pro wrestling. Mm-hmm. It's still enjoyable. It doesn't matter that it's planned out I feel like a lot of this comes down to persuasion in what ways Can you persuade somebody into your way of thinking? Uh, say if you're trying to get a job or if you're trying to get the rock on your podcast What elements of persuasion do you find most successful? Important thing to remember is that persuasion It doesn't mean that You are going to be able to implant your thoughts into someone who would not have otherwise agreed with you You have to have already have a thing that they want that you then present in such a way that it is going to get the optimal Reaction from them and you try to minimize any negativity. So the way that you word things Might be different. Uh, given example This is from the career coaching world If if you are feeling like you're like you don't have the right qualifications. Well, one don't talk about that A lot of people feel the need to say I know I'm not qualified, but Don't put that thought in their head because they might not realize that you feel that way They may see you and go you're super qualified. So with the rock you might be like I only have a thousand A thousand listeners He doesn't necessarily know that because he's probably not one of your thousand listeners I think it's really great advice. I think with the rock though I think that's the appeal Is that he's the the the people's chant right so it's like what What else would be nicer for his credibility than to go on in nobody's podcast like I'm a nobody I think that's actually going to be my advantage in this case because if I had tons and tons of followers Then I think that's an incentive if I'm somewhere in the middle I don't think it helps much. I don't know maybe maybe I'm wrong. I don't think you're in nobody though Yeah, this goes back to something we were sort of talking about before we started recording is At least once or twice a week. I'm not I'm not joking people approach me Friends of mine and I'll notice there's just a great mood I haven't seen them in a while like hey how are things going? You seem like you're doing really well I saw this this documentary on Netflix called minimalism And I always smile I know all about it and That has changed so many people's lives, but there's there's something bigger to that story the hustle That you and Joshua and Ryan had to go through to make that a reality That's something that will resonate with a person like the rock and You have made an imprint I wouldn't even be surprised if he's heard of your little documentary. That would be so cool That would be that would be pretty great Yeah, I appreciate that I really do and I still think I'm a nobody but that it's funny because that's just it literally goes back to what you're saying where Don't start off and interview by saying I know I'm not qualified and that's exactly what I just did But anyway, I don't want to I don't want to scrub you trying to throw it there because I think that was really really good advice for people who are Trying to get what they want whether it be a job interview or land a date think of think of musicians who are Not famous yet and they have a new song and they start off with going this song is shit Yeah, they don't they don't know it might be your favorite song It they shouldn't give you any any Any idea of what they think of it and just let you interpret it for yourself And because everybody is going to have that insecurity no matter how good they are there's always a feeling of Am I really this good or am I just getting lucky? I've had the feeling and by now I've coached over 3000 people and still to this day I'm like am I just faking it? I mean, I get that all these people were successful They could have been without me did I help them along? I think I did and and I know objectively I did But they're still that sneaking in posture syndrome where you're like But there's all this other stuff. I don't know yet or I haven't done yet that other people have done So maybe I'm not good enough And you have to it's fine. That's going to be there you shouldn't waste valuable Energy trying to stop thinking that way just don't act that way Would you not call it faking it till you're making it or would you set would you frame it in a different way? Is it technically faking it? I don't want people to fake it. That's something that also happens in the dating world where especially with men they are taught to Demonstrate value and in all these things that DHV DHV only get those IOS And the problem there is they're often demonstrating an illusion something they don't possess What I would say is you should first figure out what do I have to offer And once you know what that is and it may take time to figure it out you may have to talk with your loved ones But once you know what that is you have to figure out okay Now how do I package it how do I present this to other people so that they will want to be a part of it? So you're not really faking it you're figuring out what you have and then you're presenting it now You may question just how good it is So maybe that part feels like you're faking it, but you have to make sure there is some kernel of value that you really have How does the Spartan plan come about I remember when you first came out with this was a two years ago It was you started to initiate this challenge to people. It started out as the Spartan month I think or Spartan plan for one month. It was the craziest shit ever and I tried it and I failed within like a week I am not sure if that has much to do with the Spartan plan now if it's a similar program that you run But walk me through some of what that initial launch was yeah So I I've had some some weird experiences in my life. I Did hurricane Katrina relief and You know 12 years ago I had military training and all these things that had sort of instilled a Sort of like a stoic But identifying with the Spartans mentality and I always used February as a challenge month. I never talked about it to other people's just a challenge for me And I had like a list of things I did so I one of the things that Virtually everyone failed that was I don't use hot water in February or even warm water meaning ice showers in the dead of winter and That was a part people just didn't want any anything to do with yeah, I didn't do that part I was like I'm gonna just cross that one up from the beginning, but there were other things like drink only water Eat only whole foods exercise every single day read for an hour every single day Sleep for at least eight hours every single day. There's like a list of ten things that I felt if you could do them You at the end of the month would be a better person for it and then you could decide what you wanted to keep and So it was Admittedly maybe a little too difficult for mass appeal So I'm gonna probably draw it back a little bit and every but but Spartan plan the the program I'm now building is still a spin off of that It's this idea of What are these few things you could do so not ten anymore, but a few things you can do consistently and Build into a habit that will have a maximum impact on your life There's a lot of different diet advice out there fitness advice and I'm not saying it's bad, but I believe that if you want 80% of the results there's only a few things you need to do you need to move There could be a lot of different ways you like to do that, but most of it comes from what you eat Don't drink your calories So yeah, I mean, I drink coffee, but I drink black coffee or more plain tea Eat real food what it so don't drink your calories Would you say no smoothies or does that is that an exception to the role? I mean there are people who do smoothies. I once in a blue moon moon I just I just like to eat the fruit though because yeah feel more full yeah What were some of these other principles that you're you're talking about? Those are some of the big ones sleep Yeah, it is such an overlooked thing people say like I'll sleep when I'm dead You'll be dead a lot sooner and even if you're not you're gonna feel less than optimal if you're not sleeping properly Dude, I hate it when people say that that was like when I first started up There I had some some mentors early on that would repeat that look I'll sleep when I'm dead and it was especially in like the music video world It was very much you work throughout the entire night. You put in 18 20 hour days and I've only done a couple of those But I'm like looking at some of these people that are pretty old and continuing to do this over a long period of time And I'm like man that cannot be sustainable No, and even if they even if they live to be 90 I just wonder what the quality of life is For me if I'm honest, I was on a sleep debt with this hurricane Harvey business over I live in Texas And I had to stay up for 36 hours straight So I made up for that by sleeping for about 15 hours. Yeah straight. It was fucking incredible And I just thought to myself why would I why would I not give myself that when that was clearly what my body needed So people This happens a lot in the startup world when people are trying to be real scrappy and hustle and I admire the hustle people like Gary Vaynerchuk They're all about like just work long hours just put in more work than anybody else. I'm all about Working harder and smarter, but there should be a limit like you you got to take care of yourself as human and have to remember Why the hell am I even doing this? You know, yes, the work can be a part of your passion And maybe that's your main passion, but you can only enjoy it so well if you're if you're not rested if you're not properly fueled and you won't be as good If you're not properly fueled. I think it wears on your patience too and if you are not getting enough sleep You're gonna you're more likely to break out into fights with the people that are closest to you I think that's something that Maybe overlooked and when you're punishing yourself your body and you're just working crazy long hours Like you said, yeah, there are times for that. There are times when you have a book launch or a film that you're creating and then you have a deadline You're running up against and I think in a lot of ways I'm totally okay with that and I think I've I get a sense of excitement from that and like working long hours when I really have to and pulling all nighters Like I will do that when I have to do it. I do it less and less the older I get I think I had a little bit more when I was in my early 20s. I could do that a little bit better But yeah, I think that you have to kind of You have to balance that and like you said why are you doing this and is it sustainable over the long run? And I would say for the most part it's probably not do I've heard I was just having a conversation with my family this week About sleep and how much sleep is the right amount to get and obviously it's very different for everybody I find that personally seven hours of sleep is is like right in my wheelhouse where if I get any more if I get eight plus hours of sleep I tend to be over-tired I wake up more draw Graggy than I would otherwise where do you fit in that realm and what have you heard about sleep in terms of well-being In the studying that I've done I mean it varies. There are people who who don't need as much and that may not just be It may vary throughout your lifetime or you might need way more when you're in your teenage years That's sort of thing because you're you're growing and developing For me personally usually eight hours, but if I'm on a big debt of sleep I might sleep way longer or last night for example I I slept probably six hours The idea though is I make space for the sleep and I prepare for the sleep So I'm not looking at my phone the sort of thing I'll try to just read a book and calm down And if I happen to just be kind of laying a bed I might get up and walk the dog or do something to that's still relaxing But I make sure that there is space for the sleep and Hopefully it happens, but if it doesn't I'll probably still be fine Tell me a little bit about the the current routines that you've been in in terms of your morning routine I know we were just talking about this beforehand You've started to make some some interesting changes Yes, I wake up now at five thirty in the morning with my wife and We go to the gym We don't typically do anything very intense in our early morning workouts. We save that for the weekends But we'll just pop in here progress like yeah We'll go we'll go to the gym do like a little bit of low Intensity cardio and From there we'll come home walk the dog. I I don't have to go anywhere to to work. I'm fortunate So I have hours when I get home to just relax Read the newspaper read a book And I don't typically eat until after noon and It's not a hard rule, but I just typically don't get hungry I'm on a I think I told you I do sort of a ketogenic type diet where higher fat Very little carbohydrates mad ends up leaving me with a lot of energy that I don't have to eat that often And so I try to kind of go with what my body wants to do and And you know as it gets dark I tend to get tired and so I'll settle down I don't usually work at that point, but if I do need to The lights that we have in the house is very cheesy, but we found these I think it's called lighting science Give them a plug here They should totally sponsor your show that would be great But they have and then the only lights that I use on the show should be there But really orange light warm lights. Yeah, the very warm lights And on the blue light which can help well the blue light restricts the melatonin production in your brain Which makes it harder to to follow sleep So we like to use those at night and you know, it's it's hooking and maybe it's only a negligible difference But sometimes the placebo effect is important too I guess you could say I'm light sensitive in terms of like I'm very aware of the lighting Especially as I'm getting ready for bed all like start to slowly turn down the lights over the span of three to four hours Natalie has she doesn't get it and then shoulders walk in the kitchen flip the light on and then wake me up and it's She doesn't quite understand and we're very different in that regard but we work through it But I feel like that's important at least for me and that might be a placebo effect Maybe I'm not I don't really understand Maybe I'm kind of tricking myself to think that it's important possibly, but if it is to you then it is I look out My wife Kate she kind of goes along with it and thinks oh, this is fun. Let's try this out She's so used to me experimenting on things by now that once in a while She's like yeah, I'll do that one and then other times she's like no you're crazy. This is you okay cool Because I thought maybe I was the only one it's great that she'd to experiment with you Natalie I'll be like hey, so I'll say about getting ready to the TV Because you know I want to start listening to more podcasts and you know we can always get it back and that it was just like no You're not getting rid of the TV. I need to watch my bachelor and I'm like All right, okay, well, we'll keep actually but then when she said that it made me want to get rid of it even more And then it becomes a thing and then now she knows better that if I say something crazy like hey I think I want to get a gun and then she's like and I actually know you're you're into shooting and I think it's probably I've gotten into Sam Harris a lot in Joe Rogan and a lot of them talk about like gun on her Shab Jakko willing and it's I'm like Man like kind of crazy dream last night where somebody broke in and like tried to kill us and I was like I need a gun I need a gun and She now knows not to just completely say you're not getting a gun She's okay. Well, we'll see about that and then I probably just let it go Tell me about the gun stuff because that's uh, it seems really fun and really really cool Have you always been into guns or was this just a new hobby that you started to pick up and Archery archery yeah bow hunting. I had I had been a vegan for 10 years and I grew up around guns my dad owns several guns So I've always had a certain knowledge of them and the time I spent in the in the army I had experience with rifles I hadn't done much with them for over a decade But I was sort of considering not being a vegan anymore and I was trying to find the the best way to go about doing that because I still believe in In a lot of the philosophy behind why I was a vegan the environment and I care about animal welfare So I thought well, I can do I can I can get organic free range meat which I do but I also thought we'll A way to get more in touch with nature and a way to fuel At least to some degree like I've earned what I'm eating is to try my best to to go out and get it myself And I that kind of got spurred on by the Joe Rogan podcast and Cameron Haynes who I'm a huge fanboy of I saw that he he got into bow hunting and he was an athlete about it and I was looking for sort of this thing to fill the athletic void of of pro wrestling And so I my gateway drug was was my compound bow and I became obsessed every Saturday if you go to my Instagram It's nothing but me shooting my bow or shooting guns the the guns came later for a similar reasons There was a break in and one of my neighbor's houses and not too long ago And maybe a year before that there was a an active shooter in the building where my wife works And I just thought okay, yeah, obviously those things are rare thankfully we live in it in safe times But they're not They're not a zero percent chance of happening and When they do happen that the police they're gonna do their best they can to keep you safe But they can't be there instantly They're not gonna be there if somebody breaks through window and starts not at all, you know looking for you And statistically speaking if you're home during the break in They're going to try to kill you I ended up getting my license to carry in taxes to got a small Collection of guns and I but I went to step further in like Sam Harris talks about I've taken tactical classes to brush up on my skill set So I'm I'm an expert with the weapons that I have and the the training that I go through They'll they'll tell you the guy is an X police officer and he says look We're gonna do our best to keep you safe, but you need to you need to be the first person to do that Honestly most of what we do is to come try to figure out what happened afterwards because of these things They don't take very long Not to get political on your show, but we're in a time where this country is very divided and I tend to In most cases lean left there are certain that I have a guns so I'm not always left leaning I love it when liberals get guns. I just hate the the how people Fit into the identity politics and and everything's always in one boat and it's just nice to see that people Think for themselves. I'm I can found people because I I voted for Hillary Clinton and I'm also an NRA Remember there you go, but I think that this has been valuable because since we're so divided a lot of times people aren't talking to the other the other side that often and Getting involved in hunting and guns has brought me in touch with these people who see the world very differently for me and But I like them. I see them and I go out. That's a cool person, but they they voted for someone I don't agree with So maybe I can still respect them and understand that there's ideas like oh everyone who voted for that other person is This or that and that what I found is that's not true for example I know people who vote for Donald Trump who are definitely not racist or at least They're black people who don't like black people then because I know black people who voted for Donald Trump sure and I know other people who aren't black Who voted for him and I'm part black and they they fucking love me So it's not It's not as cut and dry is what people want to believe it's much easier to say They're bad. We're good instead of this is complicated and we should talk to each other It's funny how little politics matter when you're not talking about politics You know what we might as well at this point get into the one and only segment of the podcast It's called quick questions Okay, so quick questions Not necessarily quick answers. It's really up to you. You really you do you and then I'll do me The easy part is in my world But I've got some questions prepared for you Question number one what's easier said than done? Taking risks People say to just go do it. You know, it's a Nike slogan just do it That's easy to say but it's hard to do it. What advice would you give to somebody who needs to just do it create a consequence What I like to recommend is send money In an envelope to a friend, but address it to an organization you hate vehemently With a deadline and set a smart goal something that's you know that's actionable that you can measure it But it has a timetable and it has to be within your Reach you can't say like oh, I'm I'm gonna get this job It would be like I'm going to apply to this many jobs something that is completely within your control And that will usually create a consequence to your inaction that is greater than your perceived consequences to action. How do you deal with criticism? I try to work on that and get better. I'm human though So there may be times where Someone critiques something that I do. I'm sure that in this podcast I must have said the word so Like 500 times. I say so all the time as well and I'm and I'm becoming conscious of it because one of my students made me conscious of it They were like every time you switch ideas you say so and now I hear it and every time I'm so goddamn it But I recognize that the only way I'll get better is by getting criticized Because I'm not gonna know everything that I don't know I need someone outside of me to point out what I'm doing wrong sometimes. There are other times where I know But there's there's like a ceiling that you get to where you need someone who who has more experience now that said On the flip side Sometimes I'll get criticism from someone who I feel is Unqualified to give me advice and My response is sort of okay cool. I don't care Or if they keep pushing and I'm like ah fuck off. Yeah, right you have to know What's important to you and sort of This goes for criticism this goes for like things you spend your time in like recently I got rid of all my novels I own because I realized I don't like reading novels and people are like crew you should read novels. They're good for you I believe that that may be true, but I don't like them. I like watching movies. That's how I'll get my narratives And I read nonfiction So, you know, that's great for you, but fuck off. I don't want to get fuck off That's really good advice. Yeah, you have to be able to distinguish where you're getting the criticism from is it a YouTube comment or is it your best friend and Knowing the difference and does your best friend know what the fuck they're talking about? Yeah, exactly and my best friends don't Your big podcast fan what are like the your favorite podcasts that you'd recommend The Jill Rogan experience I love the Tim fair show everybody knows about these Something that I've gotten into more recently is a vox podcast the weeds Which just gets real deep into different political concepts Which helps me learn more at least about some small part of this grand thing that's going on in the world So the weeds vox in general tends to simplify things that are really complicated for me to understand I would say that I also really like The school of greatness lose house. Mm-hmm. It's a lot of personal development stuff Which it's kind of just like this podcast, but just like more famous people Like he kind of talks about people stories and then sees where they came from which to me is sort of like what you get from reading books You're you're getting a condensed version of someone's life experiences that you can then learn from When people at least when I was young I was shit at learning from other people's mistakes But now I really try to focus on what mistakes did this person already make that I can learn from because they're they're being so generous as to share it with me So I just I owe it to them to try not to make those same mistakes. Yeah, you don't have to make all the mistakes that your predecessors made or your mentors made That's why you have mentors is to Make sure you don't have to go through the the same mistakes and screw ups that they went through Similar question What source do you go to when you're feeling doubt? So is there a book that you go back to a podcast episode you go back to or a friend There there are a lot of those things By wife is an immense immense Force in my life she's definitely been sort of someone who pushed me with hack reactor my job now There was a lot of doubt. I was scared I was comfortable in what I was doing there was no financial incentive like parrot imperative I didn't have to switch what I was doing But she knew that this was the right next step for me and she just pushed me into doing it She was like what's the worst thing that's gonna happen? She started sounding like me when I coach people And it's like well, I don't like I could fail at this. She's like great. Okay, and then what? Well, I won't have a job. She's like do you think you can find another job? Oh, yeah, she's like then who cares? And So she's a big part as far as a book I Highly recommend Maybe this is a little too esoteric, but have you ever heard of Alan Watts? Yeah, so he wrote a book called the book On the taboo of I don't know the subtitle the book. It's kind of sad. I've read it like five times and I don't know the subtitles Like the truth of who you are. Yeah, but it helps me sort of the way I look at the world Maybe this is because of the exposure to Zen Buddhism But I look at it like there's this crazy shapeless journey that we're all on and We're trying to make sense of it so our brains try to overlay a grid on top of reality to figure it out to measure it Now that's not reality, but we convince ourselves that it is and when our grid doesn't give us the result we expect Then we feel this uncertainty and doubt and we freak the fuck out But it's valuable at least for me to occasionally remind myself hey crew You don't have this figured out this is just to grig you you laid over reality to try to make sense of it It usually works, but it is not reality in and of itself One last thing before we we wrap up this episode how should people connect with you online? Where do they go? So so they can email me crew at Spartanplan.com That's my website Spartanplan.com as far as social media Only ones I use would be Facebook, which is just slash crew spends Instagram is at crew spends and LinkedIn is In slash crew spends pretty easy on it.
