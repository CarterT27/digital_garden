## Transcript
 Getting off of social is no different than stop watching CNN or Fox every night or reading the journal or the times We consume as animals and I think if one feels overwhelmed, they should stop consuming Gary V is one of the most celebrated entrepreneurs of our generation He's the author of several best-selling books including crushing it and jab jab jab right hook He's a speaker podcaster in CEO of the ad agency Vayner Media in this short 30-minute conversation I get his take for the first time on minimalism He talks about what it means to hustle with intention and provides advice for those looking to live a meaningful life Well, dude, thanks so much. You're working. Connecting so I don't have you. Are you familiar with minimalism? I'm familiar with it the way that many people are familiar with most things which is they can headline read But they're not, you know, it's not something I'm deeply aware of but on the headlining of you know Keeping things simple not having a whole lot of stuff like those kind of things I can understand the nuances from afar Has anybody called you a minimalist before? No, but it's funny that you just said that like I understand that about me in some weird way I mean, honestly, well, you look at your office You got the jets memorabilia a lot of stuff and things and a lot of people They have misconceptions about what minimalism is and if you have a lot of shit that means you're not a minimalist Yeah, I mean, it's just a term, but realistically a lot of this that you've been talking about lately and even over the past 10 years has been about Stop focusing on materialism consumerism. We're getting distracted with stuff if that's where it goes Where it's like, you know if it if there's a deeper understanding to why one own something Then it's a movement. I can get really behind once I get educated because I'm desperately sad that People buy things to close emotional gaps. Why do you think that people do are getting distracted with Consumer purchases the car they can't afford because people are insecure and They need validation from others and I think they use items to get validation from others I really do I think I think when I think about anything I buy it's a hundred percent for me even all the Chacha's the thrill of finding them at a garage sale or like the one thing I actually buy that I think is silly is like custom New York jet's jerseys, but so for me And I'm happy that I don't buy things for other people's opinions But I think most people do I just watch that's that you're a meldor and talk that you gave I believe it was last Yeah, and you were talking about and try you were essentially encouraging 30 to 40 year olds to downsize Move back with the parents Where does that come from? There's something very in the ear that is manifesting to me that's clear Which is we have a lot of people out there that really pretty much lived their lives based on other people's opinions and I just know that right now somebody's listening or watching who Overcended themselves and owns things they can't afford Actually desperately loves their parents Like you know it probably comes from place of like secretly I'd like to still be living my parents I like them so much it'd be nice, you know I don't feel a bird and if I walk through the kitchen be like hey mom like I can live my life But like it'd be nice to say hey mom like I like it anyway nonetheless I think a lot of people are overextended and I think they can restart and if they're in the context of You're overextended Your underwater your in debt you're living too much above your means you can sell off your home That you bought that was too big for you in the first place Get some level of dollars back or at least get out of debt or a mortgage move back it with your parents Which is it if you're if you're not worried about your high school friends or your co-workers Saying oh I'm sorry that you move back in with your parents if you can deal with the stigma Well, then that's probably a nice way to save some you know, first of all again plenty of parent and children relationships are not great But plenty are amazing and They're that to save the money There's millions of relationships out there We're both the kid and the parent would think it's the greatest thing that ever happened that the kid came back and lived there for a year or two including the family you know people have pride or or have a preconceived notion that that's unacceptable That's in the air and so I'm trying to start conversations that I believe in I believe there are hundreds of thousands of people who would become miraculously happier If they if they saw the world in a different way and did something as practical and as Out of left field and at least today is popular society as selling their home Getting back that equity Moving in with their folks for a couple of years and reestablishing a You know, one of the big things that I'm passionate about is are you doing something you enjoy to do? Like happiness and fulfillment It has to become a much bigger part of the conversation than financial upside I'm always very hurt when people think that I'm pushing hustle and too much work and make it for the money You know, my behavior doesn't map to that I would have been a venture capitalist then like I'm I'm talking about actually liking what you do and being in a place where you don't have Issues or internal mindset struggles because you actually have been able to start the process of Not worrying about other people's opinions the best decision. I ever made in my life was after college $97,000 that buying a brand new car that wasn't the best decision, but it was then moving home and Being able to spend two years at home with my parents Starting my business. Actually's funny the my the the retain client that changed my life was actually Vibilar I was like their video guy for years and actually I did an interview with you Maybe like six seven years Yeah, that's how but if I didn't move home if I didn't take that Leave yeah that lead I mean because everybody was starting going out with their starting salary is they were Making money and then for me to move literally my parents basement making no money That was where like minimalism came in for me where I saw and I was like oh, I don't I don't need all that stuff I don't need to prove anything to anybody. I don't need to prove anything to myself Like I'm happy with what I have now and I'm happy with the stuff that I'm making and I have a vision of where it could go And I think too many people get just trapped in this idea that they have to prove themselves to other people 100% you talk a little bit about hustle I think if we had done this interview a year ago Even before crushing it It would have been a different interview because you have Talked a lot and I think Clarified a lot of your vision of what it means to hustle to work hard and obviously there's a lot of people that have There are only opinions about hustle and hustle porn and all that stuff So we don't have to kind of go all into that but I am curious about How do we hustle with intention so for myself and And there's a lot of people like me who are incredibly ambitious about their work lives, but they're also ambitious about their health They're wellness their relationships How we make sure that it doesn't sway too far. Well, you know, we definitely don't Do it by listening to Gary Vee or the anti Gary Vee We make it very contextual to ourselves and we also don't judge ourselves through the process They're gonna be times where naturally it be right now I'm in the phase in my health in working out Especially after I really severely sprayed my ankle where Over last four years I'm probably at the heaviest I've got the most fat that I've had in four years and For last three months I've just not been in the same zone that I've been for last four years I'm dealing with it by not over judging myself And so Things have been flow like right now you're massively good physical shape I think you're still hurt. I did by sex today But I'm sure you and two to understand they'll probably be a chapter where you won't be as tight on your regimen and what have you the way you know I'm very fascinated by the conversation of work ethic hustle overworking I'm fascinated by people's ability to not take on accountability I never feel like my points of view and my thoughts and my hot takes and my passions and my story are right I've never believed that in my life I don't have the right. I think I enjoy sharing them because I enjoy sharing them. I'm a communicator There's some selfish needs of communicating. I'm sure, but like I share them, but Everybody shares them this thought that You know I think one of the biggest things we need to get more thoughtful about is this question which is The answer to the question is by Conversating with yourself and trying to develop self-awareness and not look for outside validation When people email me and say Gary Vee I've been hustling 15 hours a day. I'm like you're getting enough rest you good you like are you pumped like with intention My intention is to be happy and so I'm not going to apologize for enjoying my work Like I don't need validation for my work my work is not my family or my thing You know I watch these conversations I'm fascinated by that my respect Other people points of view. I just I don't think that I just want to make sure that they don't think they're right either A lot of people that push against hard work hustle are people who've already hustled and Didn't find fulfillment from it, but maybe somebody else did in the same way that I haven't had a clearify my points of view There are plenty of interviews in 2010 where my point of view on crush it was make 86,000 a year And talk about strawberries. I've been talking about happiness The whole time I have evolved and and have been forced because I feel like I've been dragged into being a poster child of something That I don't believe in in creating clarity, but I think to answer a question directly I think you have to answer that for yourself and what I would say is don't overjudge yourself in every chapter It's okay to be losing by 14 points at the end of the first quarter of an MBA game you can win that game And so if you're if you're like working 15 hours a day for a year because you're starting your videography business That's probably okay. It does take work to start something if you've achieved some level of success three years in And you don't want to take it to a 10 million dollar business from a three million dollar business Because you fall in love and you've started a family and you want to go to whiff you want to play whiffable outside with your child That's amazing. There there is no right. There's only right for you More importantly, there isn't a line in the sand. I'll be very honest with you. I'm I'm I'm unbelievably excited to evolve There may be a read there may be a time where I don't want to be as passionate about my work and there may be some cause or some Game or who the heck knows what I'll get excited about And so I think to answer a question It's a to do it for yourself B to know that it's going to be been flow When you're 96 in debt and in basement you're grinding When you're not in the same place you don't have to do the same things you may still want to I still want to I love operating You know, I was afforded a lot of opportunities besides building VaynerMedia and having a client service business thousand employees a lot of chaos I enjoy that and Look, there's a lot of people. I don't post pictures of my family on social media Lots of people do I could judge that. I choose not to I think there's a lot of judgment in the era on this issue right now And so yeah, I'm trying to do a better job or last year of clarifying it because I don't want to be dragged down in the moment of of something I don't believe in which is Why in the world of what I believe in why would any human being want somebody to burn out and not be happy? But guess what I would be burnt out and unhappy if I work nine to five I would die Yeah, I think that was my favorite thing that you said in crushing it was this idea of Think about the people who are just judging through a job that they hate. I know unbelievable amounts of unhappiness From people that work 40 hours a week Who gets to decide? Definitely not me and definitely not people who are pushing very hard in what they perceive to be my point of view on this issue I think I've been consistent. I could have been better at clarifying it along the way One area in which you're definitely not a minimalist is the amount of content you produce yes And also the amount of content that you suggest people produce and they even in crushing it You said there's not there's not one person who isn't creating enough content and That's I I agree with you. I think obviously there's an appetite for it. You can always be creating more But in the same ways you know let's use working out because you're in such great shape You you could be in better shape. Yeah You're in really good fucking shape so that's my punchline which is like good behavior is in perpetuity I do believe in the modern internet to create awareness for something you want whether that's to raise money for a non-profit or to sell glasses I believe the volume of content is Because then you're able to contextualize it to your audience is Absolutely the leverage of the current state of consumer consumption One's capability financially energy-wise creatively, you know That's no different than saying run really fast If you can run really really fast faster than anybody you can win an Olympic gold medal and then make 25 million dollars a year in sponsorship if that's what you choose or live in a cave and say I want to go metal I'm speaking to what I genuinely believe is the right strategy You know how one interprets that you know is really up to them I think it's it's certainly true for when you're getting started out when nothing is sticking and You have to be on every platform because you don't know which one is something is sticking You need to quadruple down on it right that's what I was gonna ask you You know like I understand what you're saying you're trying to find your thing what if you find your thing is you know How to make potato salad? There's 87,000 potato salad. I mean I made a thousand episodes of wine show I'm bidder that I could still be doing Could there's too many wines or so many things one can do I don't you know come to learn that I'm a little more creative than I thought you know I see more creative angles I think people get I think people we underestimate how much creativity it takes to create content But that's why I think Documenting over creating is a very fascinating conversation but I guess with the documentary versus creating too Is that is there enough of a differentiator or terms of like I don't think you have enough Scale that you're reaching everybody so to me in a net net game I'd rather get 20% of my audience to get bored on seeing the same old thing to give me the opportunity to consistently reach more people like you know there may not be enough differentiation through the Documenting but nobody's reaching even a fraction of the amount of people they could be There are literally millions of people that are into entrepreneurship and business in America that I've never heard my name And I've gone at it hard for the last 10 years At scale at the tipi top of my game and I think we'd all agree I'm out there A million's millions of Americans that are into entrepreneurship and business that have never heard my name So that's something I believe that has to map your ambition same with any brand Service organization You know, I think the fragmentation of attention across all these mediums has created a scenario where you can't have over exposure You talk a little bit about quality being subjective and in a lot of ways that that comes to play with this idea I I want to push back a little bit on that yeah, because I mean at least from my own experience It's been Producing one high quality video every single week and that's like Eventually what it became in the beginning it was podcasting. I'm doing eight teasers for every single podcast I'm putting them on social. I'm sharing them with the people that were on my show and it became So much work when I was seeing a massive return on these short edited videos that I was making eight videos on YouTube and then it became for me how can I make one amazing video every week versus five decent videos? That's what worked for you. Yeah, and first Steven Spielberg gets one movie You know a year Yours is doing way too much volume for him Right and for me, it's not even close to enough volume Because I think there's 47 meaningful pieces of content potentially in this 40 minutes we spend together I think that's right. I think that goes back to self-awareness and back to the theme that's I think evolving here, which is this is very contextual You know I think that's right for you and by the way, I think the debate for you is If you know how much microcontact does come out of this 40 minutes You used to be a lot more I mean because it was just for me. Here's the question and if you hire somebody for $40,000 a year Who's great at it in post-production contextual to social? Will it be much more and will that lead to much more awareness to the top of the macro piece of content that you're passionate about? Yeah, and then it becomes what are your ambitions? Do you want to make that investment? So I really don't think there's a right or wrong. I think that what I'm passionate about is oh my god There's a permission For an enormous amount of content and for you this has been the way it played out But for some people a single piece of microcontact on Instagram became the piece that brought them Awareness to their long-form YouTube video Also at the beginning if you're shitty, it doesn't matter like making one shitty thing a week it'd be better to make five shitty things Or maybe or to your point. I don't think so. I think like You know, I think shit is shit like the audience gets to the side. I think you know this format works for you This will be fun. So I did last year a 30-day social media detox quit social media I still uploaded YouTube videos once a week Yeah, but I didn't really see a social media for me. Did you read you didn't read the comments? I didn't read the comments now I completely I saw the greatest I had a video of viral at that time which now is eight million views which But so that's it's hard to say it's because I quit social media that my social media following grew But I saw a massive growth in my audience in the viral videos just to talk to that What should do it again? Yeah, but I think did you like it? Yeah, no, I love it. It was great But like for me when was this this was October last year But the idea and this is something that Seth go and he's talked about Count Newport has talked about the idea that social media is a symptom that just because you have 10x social media Managers on your team doesn't mean you're gonna do 10x 10x the numbers. Yeah, that's right What are your thoughts on Social media obviously you were one of the first ones. I was talking about how important it's going to be for brands and personal brands This retraction now for a different reason. I think it's great. I mean I to me I don't overthink it. I You know there was time like to to me. I'm so contextual like Do I don't think you grew because you're off it. I think I appreciate you Quantifying like look that viral video like you get a YouTube video that has eight million views Pop on it or two million at that little window you're gonna feel the effects on your social social numbers Yeah, I mean look I think that I think that people need to try to be self-aware about What makes them happy and doesn't make them happy right now social me I do social media as a as a mirror I think what people are putting out is an incredible indicator of what's inside of them So right now there's a lot of political anxiety There's a lot of ideological anxiety and so what we're seeing is a lot of judgment You know, I think you know the early days especially when you and I were on it I like there was a lot of Nirvana early users was very soft. I think you are seeing a different version of that today, but that is you know Getting off of social is no different than stop watching CNN or Fox every night or reading the journal or times We consume as animals and I think if one feels overwhelmed they should stop consuming But I don't put social media consumption in a very different place then the films and music and and books that one reads Like the collective replies of people's angst is no different than Kirk Cobain's singular angst other than it's a collective versus a singular and so I think it's great and like when people like oh like like what do you gonna think about that? I'm like I don't care about social media. I really don't I care about humans communicating with each other I'm that same by communication and I'm fastened that we now have a collective ability to communicate a scale that we've never seen before And I think right now people are focusing on the downside of that and I think we're forgetting the upside of it There's so much love and greatness going on every day I think humans find what they're looking for you're signing into Twitter to find a fight or to find somebody to fight with or to see some negativity you're gonna find it I think if you go to Twitter or Instagram to find happiness and positivity it's there at scale I'm curious for people who are trying to find meaning in life To live a meaningful life what would you say to them? I think a couple things you know It's a very heavy question. I think people first of all have to give a lot more thought to the environment and the parents that raised them There's a lot of answers in there like a lot So that's interesting to me. That's just one hot take. I believe one of the great ways to mix things up is What you listen to and who you surround yourself with I Would I'm unbelievably passionate about people finding more optimistic practical friends And I and I think optimism gets Can get can slide into delusion which is why I say optimistic or practical You know It's funny as you were talking about minimalism like I didn't It's so interesting that you the first person ever say it to me that I can recall and it feels very real to me Like I don't have outside things Kind of driving me and that's what leads me to a lot of happiness and so I would say auditing your circle Like if somebody wants a meaningful life, a little meaningful life leave just get happier I think the people that you spend your time with is a big one the amount of people listening right now Who've got a mother who's super pessimistic and cynical But they love their mother and they don't realize that Cutting down their time from seven hours a week of engagement with their mother to two and adding Like going out of their way to seeing the person that's always smiling in the office And trying to spark up a friendship and become friends with that person and cutting up that seven hours a week From mom to two to mom Maybe 30 minutes with that person and maybe reallocating the other hours to themselves or other things Is a massive deal. It's a massive deal Like there's only offense and defense There's only the force in the dark side Right and I think that Right now people are a lot of people are choosing To be driven by fear and negativity without realizing it and so if you're listening right now My biggest thing is Start leaning into a little bit more of optimism and positivity I think we're in over corrects is when it goes into delusion And that's when you start creating entitlement and that is the tightrope that I've been talking about thinking about watching And it's I create entitlement a lot of times because I like positivity and it took me a little while Maybe 20 or 30 years 20 years of operating and managing and parenting and being like okay I can see this but I'm but I'm a product of not having entitlement I mean everything you're talking about is in line alignment with like minimalist principles living a meaningful life I think it's just that sometimes people put their their own life and try to fit it into a box They try to they try to they're not personalizing it enough of themselves Too many people aren't asking themselves they're right questions. I think one of the things that is probably evolving my content is As I have more attention. I feel a greater responsibility And so I've become very passionate about creating more context I think I'm at my best when I have time to talk like this and I'm not when I'm too excited on stage or in a one second clip You know, I think that I'm I'm becoming more thoughtful because I'm Surprised at the sheer level of quick judgments that our society has become comfortable with I thought about doing it myself. I mean I rewrite right crush it and I'm like There's some things in there that I could pull up and say hey, this is kind of crazy Yep, I'm like this is no worse than pulling up tweets from 10 years ago It's like just have a conversation. It's it's very easy to do that because I think it's very easy and it's also written in context I wrote that book in 2008 When people like the economy collapsed and this internet thing emerged and there was a land grab There was an amazing opportunity if you were a fast mover on those platforms and those things played out You know, it's not as easy to build a huge personal brand or a media property on YouTube or podcast or Instagram as it was five years ago It's applying demand You know, so I don't feel anything or any like it's contextual Like, yes, I think you should have spent all your money on Manhattan real estate 180 years ago And that was a good bet. Yeah, so yeah, you know, I also I also I'm one of the things that struck me in the last year that I'm like oh wait a minute these people think that right I Never think I'm right ever I think I'm communicating my observations I have no interest in telling anybody how to do anything Really, I don't I don't have that level of audacity and I think I think what I'm watching is much more much, you know, I don't I'm surprised that some of my friend contemporaries that take different points of view are coming at it with more of a I'm right you're wrong You know, that's been really interesting to me that's something I want to throw more in the air It's probably why I'm yapping out and being late because I respect your platform and like just kind of respect your point of view on this like I'm surprised that we've gone not surprised we are in that place And so I want to I'm gonna do a much better job over next half decade to say look this is how I see it These are my circumstances and I think I'm I also pretty aware of my happiness And not that everybody has the same chemicals or circumstances, but I I would feel we're missed not to speak about What I say I also think that when we start demonizing work ethic we get into it I think we are the byproduct of the last 10 years being so fruitful You know, a lot of the people that push against me are venture backed company founders who were able to raise 25 million dollars over four years based on their idea by never running a profitable company So everybody and not that they're wrong. I just think everybody has different perspectives So I think we need to get into a healthier you know minimalism. I'm sure I don't know I assume there's some sort of counter debate to it And yeah, yeah, like there's a minimalism is dead and it's just a whole thing I mean from the same perspective of hustle. It's like whoa, it's not a call. This is just some ideas I think it's important and I think you know for example, I think I both love work ethic and minimalism I think they're you know, I already know that I'm a kind of a nigma and have like some pretty Contradictions within me so I'm hoping that because of that and that's just the luck of the draw of DNA And given the platform that I've earned and have been afforded Maybe I can create some better conversations because I think I think it'd be a really good time for all of us in any sector about any debate Redbursts is white wine let alone minimalism, anti-minillism, hustle and then it's a really good time to get back to a cordial state of debate I also know it's contextual Like how can't you tell somebody who's not afforded any opportunities that work ethic isn't going to help them? There's no no thing you can pull up that speaks to me saying money is happiness I wasn't raising that environment. I know it's not true So I think it's so much fun. Yeah Thanks for watching.
