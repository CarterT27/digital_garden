## Transcript
 Great choices always feel inevitable after the fact, and so like in a film when like when a sequence is really working it's because you can't imagine any song but that song or you can't imagine any cut but that cut But when you're the one sitting in the editing room and you have every choice It's like a really it's like it's it's it's crazy. Yes, and I think that's a magical that's I mean it's cool to hear that story I think it's a that's the addicting part of the process to me is that time and post and you're trying to figure out like what gives this film power Because maybe it's different than the thing that I set out thinking you know, I mean like we've been wrestling with this latest cut and it's the same thing It's like what is the thing at the heart of this thing that's making it go like what is it and how do we find that and focus on that and Cut away all the stuff that's just not because I do that's I do that a lot where I the thing that I thought coming in was going to be the big thing People are like They're not feeling tingly on the inside. It's just it's so funny how those the perceptions it's also just very different from everybody that watches it That's not true. That's a whole other that's true. That's one thing that I heard I think it was Neil Strauss said it and he's an amazing author tons and tons of books, but he'll say if everybody keeps telling me that they hate one scene or one chapter I'm I'll think about removing it, but if one person it just takes one person to say I love that that was my favorite part of the entire book And then he's like all right something's there like not if you don't need to win everybody over Yeah, but obviously there's something there if it really strikes people and sometimes I'm so surprised when people are like, oh, that's my favorite scene or that's like that interview really captured me a little while like I didn't even think about that completely Yeah, that's so true. Yeah, so you put this film out there and then was it? Yeah, well after the end we released I remember we actually sold We we signed like we sent our distribution deal for after the end and it was the next day that I was getting coffee Not for from here actually and was I looked down at New York Times to saw the cover image of the factory collapse at Ronald Plaza and I remember That's why I was saying earlier, I think the the process that we went through with after the end kind of opened me up Like I think I was in a very I was noticing a long you know, I mean like I was just in that space of like still a little tender And I I looked down and read the article about how this clothing factory mangled us head collapsed and taken the lives of at that point well over a thousand people Mostly women some children and I read in that one article that at the time of the collapse they were doing Work for you know major Western brands that I knew and I also read that it was not the first that there had been another factory collapses before that a fire just before that like it was it is just I just remember thinking like Number one how and the modern world or are we doing business in this kind of way that's leading to this sort of reckless waste loss lessening of human life and also Really really and that's what second thinking how have I never stopped think about where my clothes come from and it was a chilling thought you know being someone who grew up in a kind of Middle class American family where when you got new clothes you went to store and you you got them and you brought them home and you wore them you know and and growing up past that you looked at the price for the style and Not a whole lot else honestly if I'm being honest had ever come into my mind and suddenly You know you just takes one thing sometimes in your life to like like one window gets open Then you look through it and you're like oh my god like there's a whole world through this one window You know and I took the article back to my producer Partner that day and we started doing some research that week and I remember reaching out to people and different parts of the world some of the people who actually ended up in the film Authors activists Journalists and and just saying like help me understand this story, you know, like I'm like everyone sort of reeling from this one big incident But like help me understand What's taking place and by the end of that next week I was convinced it was a film that I wanted to make because it it's sort of in one industry which was the modern fashion industry encapsulated So many of the things that I was really interested in so many of the things that I was growing restless with and curious about Suddenly I mean back to that comment of like the vehicle it was like this one industry gives me a vehicle That I think we can use to look at all these other things
