## Transcript
 Why do we quit before we follow through with a project? We just don't know how to do it and we think well maybe the people who did it are just special or They had luck or something and so we try and don't get results quickly and think well Madden's not cut out for this and I think that is really faulty because How many things in our lives do we try and get it right on the first time and how many things are we good at That we we try one day and then all of a sudden our experts at so I think For anyone who's feeling that way if they're thinking like well, I tried this for a couple months And it's not really working out and maybe I just knock it off it. That's not like the people who can do it I think it's just a matter of what do you need to learn about your business or whatever it is that you're trying to create in order to create that thing And then also who do you need to become in order to make that happen?
