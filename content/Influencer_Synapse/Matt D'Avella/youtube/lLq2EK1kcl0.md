In this video I ask photographer Cole Younger, "Out of 100 photos how many are good enough to share?" His answer might surprise you. Does that sound clickbatey? I feel like it does. Okay I'll just tell you guys the answer. It's 2. I still think this clip is worth the watch (also the full episode is killer).

## Transcript
 So you take a hundred photos. How many of those are actually good enough for you to release online? I would say about two. Really? When I first started, when I first got my first camera, I would go out and I would take about six to seven hundred photos in a day. And sometimes I would only want to use one of them. But now it's kind of reversed where I could go out and just take like 40 photos. And I can use like one or two. My, I guess, has kind of been. I guess refined to where I can see what I want and capture it quickly. And I don't have to take as many photos now. But some days I still go out and just snap photos of weird things because I'm like, am I missing something? You know, it's just like my head is constantly going. Am I missing something? Is that texture cool? Even though like people on Instagram won't think it's cool or I don't think it's cool right now. But I might think it's cool and like a week. I kind of shoot some things I shoot for the future, especially like street scenes that are kind of boring. But like some are some of my favorite photos. Like if you look back to the 30s or 40s in LA, there's just like a normal street scene, but it's so cool now, you know? Because nothing lifts the same. People aren't dressed the same. Those buildings aren't there anymore. Those cars like you'll never see on the streets again. Forcing carriage or like, you know, even like shooting a priest right now in 50 years, is like, what is that thing? I never thought about it like that, but what can be just a regular photo today can be a masterpiece in 50s. Exactly. Exactly. And I've been thinking like that for like the last two, three years. And a lot of the stuff I don't show on Instagram or those photos or you know, it's just something that's going to be cool in like 20, 30, 40 years. Sometimes you can get surprised too when you come back and you look through. And that's the most exciting part for me is that you go out and shoot all day where we shoot this podcast and then I capture it all and then I'm like, oh shit, that came out really good. Yeah. Yeah. Even the conversation we're having right now, you forget the intricacies and like the wisdom that's packed into it. And also when you go back and you look at it on your computer, you can start to see what is worth sharing. But you didn't realize it necessarily in the moment. Right. Exactly. I'll go back photos I shot three years ago. I'm like, wow, I shot that. I can use that right now. Thank you.
