We just landed in Sydney for a 10 day trip. In this video I talk about when I first learned about minimalism and started applying it to my life. The most radical change for me was redefining my idea of success.

 So after one canceled flight, in 18 hour delay for myself, a six hour delay for Natalie, we got split up and all this madness of rescheduled flights, we finally made it to Sydney. We are in Natalie's hometown. Natalie is my girlfriend. She's Australian. Oh yeah, a bloody streuse, fair dink mate. So lately I've been doing a lot of kind of reminiscing and thinking about this film that we created Minimalism. I've got a series coming out soon called Making Minimalism that really deconstructs and talks about the What it took to make this film and I've been doing a couple of my podcast based on some of the ideas and concepts around minimalism. And in doing so I started to really think about how minimalism has changed my life and when I first started getting into it, what were some of the biggest takeaways and what were some of the most helpful things about minimalism as a lifestyle. And when I first found out about it, I was $97,000 in debt quite literally living in my parents' basement. And obviously I was pretty bummed about it. I wasn't really happy with where my life was at the time. And when I heard about this thing called Minimalism, the biggest thing by far it helped me redefine what I saw success as. So I kind of had this equation in my head where I thought I had to get stuff and then be happy. I needed to get these things first, the house, the car, all that stuff that kind of would prove to both other people as well as myself that I was successful. But then when I realized I had enough stuff to be happy, I had food, I had a house over my head, I had people and friends that cared about me. I was able to kind of cut through that and say, you know what, I have everything I need right now to be happy. I can be content in the moment and I don't need all these things in order to be happy. So I would say that was by far the biggest thing, the biggest takeaway for me for minimalism and especially in the very beginning it helped me to realize I didn't need stuff. I don't need these things to be happy, I could decide to in the moment. So I've got a lot of really cool stuff that I'm working on right now in terms of minimalism. Like I said, making minimalism a series coming out, subscribe to the blog or to the YouTube channel here. There are a lot more details about that. Stay tuned. There's more coming.
