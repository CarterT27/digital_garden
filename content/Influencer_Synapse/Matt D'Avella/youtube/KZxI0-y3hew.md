Here's a look at my everyday minimalist carry (or as the kids are calling it EDC). These are the things I carry with me everyday, as well as the things I sometimes bring along. I also breakdown the outfit that I wear 9 out of 10 days.

## Transcript
 Hey guys, what's going on today? I want to talk about my everyday carry, that is what I carry with me on any given day. Now I remember a time back before I ever became a minimalist, before I ever called myself that, I used to carry around a lot more stuff than I do now, used to wear cargo pants, they weren't fashion back then, I am defending myself. But I used to just fill them up with so much stuff that I might need. A today, I don't carry around as much, I keep it very simple. I couldn't carry around a lot if I wanted to, I wear skinny jeans, but that's not the main reason, the main reason is I carry around only what I need in the given day. And I'm going to show you exactly what those things are. And I'm also going to talk a little bit about the things that I sometimes carry because otherwise the video would be way too short. So here's my everyday carry. My wallet, phone, keys, and lens club, and that's my everyday carry. This wallet was one of the first things I bought after becoming a minimalist. I used to have one of those fold open ones that could be stuffed with business cars, receipts, and extra crap. Now I only carry with me the things that I actually use. And of course a photo of the rock. If you've watched any of my other videos, you know that this is my everyday wardrobe. Black t-shirt, black jeans, glasses, belt, and watch. Also underwear and socks, but I think that goes without saying. And it wrap things up. Here are some things that I leave the house with, depending on the time of year, where I'm going, or how bad my breath smells. So I told you guys that this was going to be pretty simple, pretty short. That's what I carry with me every day. The one reason why I talk about this is because things weren't always like this. There was a time when I carried much more stuff on me. And while I don't think that this is going to be the route to happiness and fulfillment in your life, I do find that it helps me move about my day a little bit quicker, get out the door right away. I just do that triple pat down, phone keys, wallet, and then I'm good to go. I truly do believe that there are little stressors in our lives that can add up to be big stressors. My dad always used to say, don't make a mountain out of a mole hill. But I think that when you have all these little mole hills build up, we can get frustrated very quickly and then that can lead to a negative impact on our well-being in our life. On our life. Something as little as clearing away the things that you carry every day can really make a big impact.
