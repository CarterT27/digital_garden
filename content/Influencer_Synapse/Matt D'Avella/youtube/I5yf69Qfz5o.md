 Just do it, because if you do it, you're doing more than 99.9% of the people out there talking about it. Yeah. And that's such a big thing. I think you want to make something as great as you possibly can, but don't let perfection stop you from getting started. It's the worst, it's a, it's a, it's an illness. Perfectionism is an illness in the creative field, because we all want everything to look perfect. Like you were talking to me, like you edit your podcast, I don't, you know, and I'm like, I just, I just tell about my guess. I'm like, we're just going to roll and less, you know, you literally want me something cut out or something really, you know, goes wrong technically. I'm just going to let this go. And it's, it has not hurt my situation at all. So then, you know, that extra three, four hours of editing, yeah, that could be doing something else. Yeah, that's a dream for me. I think what I want to get to is actually doing this live. Yes. And I want to keep the video up, but like, at some point, I think you're right, perfection is an illusion. Like it doesn't exist. Yeah, it doesn't exist. It doesn't exist. You know, I mean, you can spend days and days and I'm, I'm the guy that just goes, it pixel, it pixel, it pixel on everything because I'm a post guy. So I've been editing for all my life before my current professional life and I've been a colorist. So I'm really into that kind of, like, did the kind of perfection thing, but it stops you. It slows you down. Yeah. Yeah.
