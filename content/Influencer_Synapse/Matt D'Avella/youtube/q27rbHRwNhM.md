 I remember the first time I made $10. I think I sold like an ad space on my website and I was like, what? I just made $10 and it wasn't for my job. Maybe I can make 10 more and yeah, I was so exciting. Yeah, I made $100. I just followed it around a clothing company for an entire day, like 8 to 10 hours. No idea what it was going to be. Why was he filming him? And then he went to the ATM at a restaurant at the end of the day, pulled out $100 and gave it to me. And I was like, holy shit. This is my first time legitimately making money as an entrepreneur. Doesn't matter how much that first project is. I think it does unlock something in you to say, this is possible. I can actually build upon this.
