## Transcript
 You just have to dive in, we reached a limit with what we could learn at a university and felt like we had to just dive in, and that's really what our summer in Guatemala living under a dollar day ourselves became. Netflix hot, and then it got featured on Netflix, and that's really when things went to blockbusters, and we were able to raise almost a million dollars for this community. And we would just look to each other in that moment, and that's a dream moment, our website crashed from too much traffic. You could see the donation numbers, you could then immediately, you know, within the next couple of months, change happening in the community. For us, the most important part outcomes not outputs, and outputs are just the numbers of use on Netflix, or the amount of money raised, but it's not an outcome unless it's actually changing somebody's life.
