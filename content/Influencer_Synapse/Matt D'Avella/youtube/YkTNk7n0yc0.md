## Transcript
 I don't, I'm not a perfectionist at all. Like I'm literally very like, okay cool, very good. Next thing, like I'm always moving ahead, always moving ahead. And I think that for me that I'm grateful I'm not a perfectionist because I'm around a lot of them a lot of the time. And sometimes I'm like, oh, you guys could be so much more productive if you just let go a little earlier because then the percentage that something improves when you sit and chew on it for that extra 12 hours is like less than 1% and it's not that half a percentage isn't even noticeable by the people who are consuming what you're creating because they're not just sitting with it staring at it like you are and obsessing if you're, you know, if you're hypothetically a perfectionist whereas if you just let it go and kind of put it out and just let people respond to it, I think we can also grow from feedback. So even if something isn't great, even if something isn't perfect because it never will be, that's the secret. The secret is you can sit and fix it until every single piece isn't placed and think for it for like an 8th of a second that it's perfect then you put it out there and you're going to be like, oh, I wish I had changed that sir. I knew that wasn't right and it's never perfect. So believing that you can get there is what slows people down and so I'm just more like put it out there. Move on to the next thing. Put it out there. You'll learn. You'll be like, oh, I would have done that differently. Cool. Now you're already making something new that you can apply that lesson to. If you just sit on the same note for your whole life, you're kind of limiting yourself and everyone else who gets to consume what you make. Does that make any sense? I 100% agree. I wonder if it's different for people who are just starting out because say you're just starting out and I'm talking about people who are learning a craft. So if you pick up a camera for the first time and start shooting photos, you don't know that much about the crafts. So you're just trying to learn like how to set exposure, how to color Craig, how to edit, how to crop all these different things that you have to learn and there's like a thousand and thousands of tiny details. And when you're trying to learn an application and going through each of the tabs and trying to figure out where everything is, I think it takes a lot of time. And so I wonder if it's actually okay. It's probably not. I don't know. Like you tell me, but it might be okay to spend a little bit extra time when you're just getting started out like tweaking photos and actually just understanding that that's a process of learning. But at the same time, you got to get past that photo to get to the next. And you're probably going to learn more by working on your 100th photo. Then working on that one photo a hundred times. Right. Right. And I think, yeah, I mean when you're learning something new, there is going to be a process to it. So I'm not being an advocate for being sloppy. Y'all do not. Be sloppy. Don't. Right. You have to put out good shit. Yeah. Like don't put out crap. Nope. You got to use your gut. And you're like, but also there is good enough. You get like a lot of people talk about the 80, 20 principle. So you get 80% done and you're like, that's close enough. That's going to be good. Because also, man, I don't know about you, but I look back at my work from two years ago. It's always two years. I don't know why. And I'm like, that's garbage. Like that is the worst. Why did I can't believe clients pay me for some of the videos that I've made? I'm like, did they actually get value from that? Did that actually help their business in any way? Mm-hmm. It's tough sometimes to look back at it. Yeah. But, you know, 98.7% is still in me. Wow. That's my, that's my life long trip. Yeah. And just keep moving forward. I mean, you're so right in that you just have to just focus on the next project. Because even if you hated that last one, I think that's what we're trying to do is that we realize that we can get better. You're like, oh, I learned so much from that last project. I can bring that into the next one. Yeah. And you're not frustrated because you've been sitting with something that feels stale and old. It's kind of like, it's kind of like, if a woman, let's just, let's just take it to, for instance, take it to baby for a minute. Let's say a woman's pregnant. And she hits 40 weeks. And she's like, I'm not done. Give me another minute. And she wants to keep the baby longer and longer and longer. Like, that starts hurting her body because the baby's like too big. And it's like, come on, let the baby fly, not fly, but you know free. And the baby can't start to get to know its life and actually kind of be its own being outside of that space. So it's kind of that, that same idea of like, let your creativity actually be born into the world, let other people interact with it, let them be like, oh, it's cute or like, oh, it's kind of weird looking and let other people start interacting so that whatever you're creating can take on its own persona. So that people can be like, let's say with your podcast instead of you sitting with it for like three years. And being like, I'm going to make sure I'm the best podcast. And if you just sat in your room by yourself for three years and just like, you know, research every, every single, like, Mike, you could get every single light you could get for your videos if you just sat on it for three years and then you released it. Everyone would be like, did you just, did you just put like a three year old into the world? Like, what just happened? What is this? Like, where did this come from? But when you put it out as an imperfect little being, suddenly everyone can grow with it and get to know it as it grows so that there's more of that like developmental. It's sort of just, there's more of a loyal fan base because they're like, I remember when he was a baby instead of it being, is this, I'm making some very straight. That was a weird metaphor. It was a weird metaphor. I'm not going to lie, but like the idea is amazing. I mean, the idea, it connects with me a hundred percent because when I was starting the podcast, I kind of had this idea, I was like, oh, I should just record 10 episodes. I should, and like this is advice that I've heard from other people where it's like, oh, you're going to start something. You really want to be consistent with it and you don't be overwhelmed. So people say, like, just whatever you're making, if you want to really sit consistently, make 10 of them and then you can really sum every week and then give you time to make other stuff. I did not do that. Like, I just recorded a story. It was a story about the first time. I shot a reality show with E. I was just a cam up and then I forgot to hit record. It was a bad day. It was a bad day for me. Yeah. I did the only thing I was supposed to do, which is hit record. And then it was this crazy pivotal scene where this woman was going kind of crazy yelling about like this talent show that her daughter was in and she was just losing her mind. And then I forgot to hit record. The producer in my ear was like, that's perfect. Cut, wrap, burger done. And then I was like, oh my god, it was, I didn't remember record. And then I was just too too timid. Whatever it was to ashamed that I decided not to tell them. And so I never worked with them again. But I, like, it was just to let other people know and other creatives know that like, this shit happens. Like bad stuff happens when you're making and putting yourself out there in a way that you can fail. And there will be a lot of failures along the way. And a lot of times we don't, there's no platform to talk about those things. You know, sometimes people write about them in Facebook posts. But like a lot of times you, you generally just put your best stuff out there into the world. So it's nice to be able to to share that. So I posted it, put it out there. And then I was like, all right, well, what am I going to do for next week? And then it kind of was a scramble. And I wasn't that consistent for the first six months, maybe the first four months. But then things started to connect. And I started to pick up the pieces. And now I'm like, we're have a lot recorded because I really love doing it. So like, some weeks or record five episodes. And then, you know, I'll have like right now. I probably have like eight to ten episodes. Like, already like lined up and ready to go, which is just, it is, it is nice now. But I would say to get started, you don't need to do that. Just get going. And then like you said, you learn along the way. Like if I didn't release that first episode and then start making and putting out there, I never would have like the podcast wouldn't be what it is today. Right. And you wouldn't learn from getting those, those pointers from your audience. So the moral is, don't sit in a room with a three year old baby. I was going to say, give birth, give birth. That's going to be the name of this podcast. Give birth. I'm going to write that down.
