My name's Matt D'Avella. I'm a documentary filmmaker and creator of Internet videos. Thanks for watching.

A few years ago I set out to direct my first feature-length documentary called Minimalism. It was the first time that I really went "all in" on creating a project that I was passionate about. A project that I was completely invested in. Now I'm creating more original content. Subscribe to this channel to find out when I post new videos.

 Hey guys, what's going on? My name is Matt DiVella. I'm a documentary filmmaker and this is my new YouTube channel As long as I've been a filmmaker, I've created client work, which is to say people and companies have paid me to make videos. I've been very fortunate to work with some really awesome clients But three years ago, I did something different. I made an original project with a few friends It was a documentary called Minimalism and this was the first time that I'd ever Invested my own time money and energy into a project that I really believed in and It was hard. It was one of the hardest things that I've ever done and I thought about quitting along every step But there was something about creating something that I really believed in that I was really passionate about That was a turning point for me as a filmmaker. So I created this channel As a platform as a way to release new content release short form documentaries to do behind the scenes and making of content from some of the projects that I do I'm kind of making this up as I go along, but I'm really glad that you're here I'm really glad that you're watching and if you could subscribe that would be amazing And I'll see you soon
