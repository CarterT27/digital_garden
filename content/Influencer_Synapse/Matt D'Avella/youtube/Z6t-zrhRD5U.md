## Transcript
 You know, Chris and I both are what we call accidental filmmakers. We actually studied economics, we met in college with this kind of shared passion of understanding global issues and when we think about what truly matters, a lot of times we end up back at this point of making an impact. It definitely wasn't obvious to us because as I was saying there, when we started out, we didn't actually even intend to make our first film living on $1. We set out to spend a summer living on a dollar day ourselves while doing research on how families are surviving at that level and I think it comes naturally to our generation. We should film some of it and put it into video blogs or release it online. And when those videos, these short video blogs started doing really well, that's what inspired us to say, hey, okay, maybe this could be something more, maybe this could move into an actual documentary.
