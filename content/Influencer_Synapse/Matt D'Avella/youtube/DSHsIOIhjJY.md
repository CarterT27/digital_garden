Hi, my name is Matt D'Avella, I directed the Netflix documentary Minimalism & this is a look at my minimalist wardrobe. I go through every shirt, sock, accessory & footwear that I own.

Do I have too many pairs of underwear? 18 seems like a lot. I probably have too many.

I get most of my clothes from J Crew (including my t-shirts, button downs & boots). I've just found that they have a good fit for me. The watch is made by an Australian brand called Simple Watch Company. My jeans are Levi's. Gym shorts are from Adidas.
