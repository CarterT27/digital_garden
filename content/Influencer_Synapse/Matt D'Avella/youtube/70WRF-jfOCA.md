You have to make content for yourself. As a content creator it can be easy to get caught up in distractions. You start making something because it fulfills a creative space in your mind. But soon enough you start focusing on tracking likes, retweets & your follower count.

The problem is that tracking these numbers don’t lead anywhere. And they kill the creative drive that got you started in the first place. That’s why you need to continue to make your art for yourself.

This is an excerpt from episode 008 of The Ground Up Show called Making Conscious Content w/ Elliott Ashby.

 You put a lot of work into something, and then people aren't paying any attention to it. It can be a little disappointing, but that's why you really have to make content for yourself.

Because for me, it's not even about being good or bad, it's just about me being real and expressing what's on my heart, but everything has its own audience. So for me, that's like the key to doing it is not thinking I have to reach everybody. There's an audience of people that like my message, the way it is, I don't have to change it up, I don't have to be more like this guy or more like this show, I just have to be Elliott. And so my focus is like, how can I be 100% Elliott in this episode? That means wrapping or dancing or singing or making fun of myself, then that makes my show distinctively me.
