## Transcript
 If you're just getting started out, your greatest enemy is your ego. The moment you start to think that you're too good for something, you're closing yourself off from two important things, growth and opportunity. When I first got started out as a filmmaker, I took a lot of jobs that weren't very sexy. My first paid gigs included weddings, bar mitzvahs, local television commercials, and 60th birthday parties. These jobs were not at all glamorous, but I found something to enjoy in each of them. Mainly, I was learning my craft as a filmmaker and building upon each project to improve as a storyteller. There are a thousand nuanced details that go into these videos, even the 60th birthday party, even the bar mitzvah. From the lens you select, your camera settings, the music that you choose to your style of editing. It all matters, it's all important, and the stakes will get higher, but for the time being, this is your playground. There is so much opportunity to do experiments, to play around, to learn how to tell a story, to put your own personal touch on things. This is where you learn. And when you take pride in your work, when you take pride in every job that you do, a funny thing happens, people start to notice. I truly think that's been one of my biggest advantages as a creative over the past few years. I was recently digging back through some old hard drives, and I came across this video that I once made. It was an intro video for a bar mitzvah, bar mitzvah. It's the video that they play right before this young man comes out to be greeted by his family and friends. By all accounts it could be the cornyest video ever made, but when I look back at this video, I couldn't believe what I saw. The amount of time and effort that I put into this thing was hilarious. It was unbelievable. I added an intricate color grade, powerful music and special effects. I legitimately keyframed fire and flames throughout this video. Looking back on it, I realized I didn't have a choice. It wasn't that this client demanded that there'd be fire and flames in this video. It was that I took pride in my work, and I wanted to make this kid the dopest video possible. What better way to come out and to be greeted by his family and friends, but having this super special effects driven video. So, down the road, you can be more selective about the projects that you take on. But you should never be selective about the passion that you put into each of these projects. It's got to be all or nothing. That's how you grow as a filmmaker. That's how you build up a client base. That's how you get better. You have to put everything you have into everything you do.
