## Transcript
 Oh, would you look at that? My flight departs in two hours. A better start packing. Good thing I'm a minimalist. So this is personally how I pack as a minimalist. Let's start with the bag. On this trip I'll be using the packed one travel bag. I recently helped launch this product with a couple friends through an Indigo Go campaign. It's really the perfect bag for minimalist people with OCD or serial killers. Okay, let's start packing. First I'll tuck my beard trimmer and razor in this pocket. I'm going away for a week. So let's grab five gray t-shirts. And you know what, I might want to go out to a fancy dinner or something, so I'll bring a charcoal t-shirt as well. Okay, but seriously, if I don't bring a button up, Natalie is going to kill me. Is it button up or button down? I never, I never really know. Getting suit, casual shorts, hiking shorts, going out in public shorts, and socks. Now I'm a filmmaker so nearly every vacation will include my camera and usually my drone. I'll tuck the battery charger and batteries in the mesh pocket back here. Zip this guy up. My laptop goes in the center pocket. I can hide the laundry bag behind this Zip pocket, put my laptop charger in this mesh pocket here and some additional cables and accessories for the drone. A light jacket that I'll probably never wear. After getting some vanilla on a trip over the holidays, I now always bring an extra pair of underwear. So let's bring eight. All right, you know what, let's just grab all of these just in case. Man, you know what, I still have a lot of room in this thing. Why don't we bring along the framed poster for the award-winning documentary minimalism? My guitar, another bag, I'll pack my hiking sneakers, fit the rest of my drone accessories in here, and my headphones. So that's all the inside contents of the bag. I'll put my iPad in the magazine pocket, magnets will snap it shut, and I'll place my passport safely inside this pocket inside a pocket. In these two pockets up front, I'll include hair product, deodorant, and a toothbrush. My keys, I usually store my keys right in here. I'll pull out this little open. Okay, yep. And I was never meant to be a hand model. What's cool about this bag is if I pack right, I can quickly access things like my camera, or my headphones, or my laptop without digging through all the contents of my bag. And that is how I pack. It can be really stressful packing, especially when you're running late for your flight, but luckily since I'm a minimalist, fuck, that was two hours. I only miss my flight. Definitely missed my flight. If you like this video, I make a lot of them, subscribe to this channel for more, or go to minimalistfilmmaker.com. If you like podcasts, I've got one of those. It's called the Ground Up Show. I interview people like Dan Harris, Rich Roll, and the minimalist to hear their stories, and how they made things happen. Go to groundupshow.com for the podcast. That's it. Thanks for watching.
