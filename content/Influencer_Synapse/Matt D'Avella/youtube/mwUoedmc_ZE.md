 If you've been following my YouTube channel or podcast for some time, then you know that over the past year, I've had one goal and one goal only to get the rock on my podcast. You didn't have to wear a suit, I said it was casual. It's an intentionally ridiculous and vicious and oddly specific dream. I want to prove to you what's possible with a big idea and a ton of determination. I've been talking about it since I started the ground up show. I do bring up the rock in every podcast. I've been trying to get a hold of the rock, he's not picking up, he's not answering my phone calls. Who's this mad dude? I'm a nobody and two months ago, for the first time, we made contact. So I pop onto Twitter and then I saw this, the rock, the rock tweeted at me and I kind of just lost my shit. Now, this is weird. And today, we broke new ground. I logged on to Twitter, I posted another photo on Twitter about the rock, specifically actually about that photo right there, the rock that I have framed in my apartment. I told myself, I wouldn't freak out, but the rock just tweeted at me. This is the second time the rock has tweeted at me. And this time, it's even bigger because the last time I didn't mention that I was trying to get him on my podcast, but this time I actually dropped the website, it's so main. And I said that the rock, I've been trying to get a hold of him and he hasn't called me back. I said, yes, I still have a framed photo of the rock on my wall. No, he hasn't yet returned my phone calls, but I'm not giving up. If you also want to see the rock come on my podcast, go to get the rock on madspodcast.com. And his reply, check this out, I'll show you. This is insane. He said, my all-time, fave pick. Thanks for the love, man. And that's because you keep calling me from a pay phone and calling collect. Who the fuck does that anymore? Holy shit, I just saw this. So I'm going to go through, I don't, there's so many retweets, oh my god. Whenever the rock retweets or tweet something at you, what I've noticed is that it's very overwhelming. And I'm just getting flooded with all these messages and memes and emojis. Okay, I have to respond. What do you do? What do you do in this situation? What do you do? Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. What can I say? What can I say? What can I say? I'm just going to go with that. Brevity is the, brevity is, there's a saying. And it goes like this. Brevity is the soul of wit. What can I say? Cash is tight. I don't have that leather fanny pack money. Done. So it's been a big day. It's been a really good day. And I just want to thank everybody who has tweeted at the rock. I know thousands of you have tweeted at the rock. And attempt to get his attention and to get him to go to get the rock on matspodcast.com. And I appreciate every single one of you. I don't think that he would have responded without you guys bombarding him with messages all the time. So first of all, thank you. Now he might not be able to do the podcast anytime soon. I know he's working on a movie. He's a busy guy. He's got a lot of stuff that he's doing. But there will be a time when he does press and he's ready to do interviews. And that's when we can make this happen. So I'm not giving up anytime soon. I'm in this for the long run. Whether it takes six months or six years. I won't give up. I won't keep renewing this domain. I got it. I already tweeted at him. I said, I said, what can I say? Cash is tight. Sweat face emoji. I don't have that leather fanny pack money. That's pretty good, right? I think that's, I mean, I was going to say thanks to response pound. But then I'm like, you know what? I think it'd probably be better to just play it cool. Yeah. Although this video is not playing it cool by any means.
