## Transcript
 So, Shaebutter is amazing, but I didn't start using it until late in life, and if you have some emotional music, you can drop it in right here, and if you just do a close-up, just a pan. Shaebutter for me, my middle name is Ashby, and so my middle name is what I use online. I use LED Ashby, it kind of has a certain feel, and they're both my real names people. But I didn't use it growing up because growing up, I would use lotion, and the lotion would dry out over time, and because of the color of my skin, I would become Ashby, and you know, I didn't want to talk about it. I didn't want to be Elliot Ashby, you know, I just thought that wouldn't be a good look. So, you know, it wasn't until later in life when I discovered Shaebutter that I was really able to really reclaim my middle name, it was a process, you know, seriously, I can't do that for very long.
