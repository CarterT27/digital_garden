Itâ€™s never too late to turn things around. Today Rich Roll is an ultra-endurance athlete, author of the best-selling book Finding Ultra & has been named one of the world's 25 fittest men.

But only a few years back he was heading into middle-age unhealthy, overweight & overworked. How did he turn things around? He risked it all. I sat down with Rich to talk about the challenges he faced, how he grew his podcast to over 25 million downloads & his search to find meaning.

People get so caught up in the cameras you have a phone go out and make a video if you want to be a filmmaker it's never been easier all these tools are at our fingertips now but we get scared and so we hide behind the gear or the questions as an excuse to not just begin.
