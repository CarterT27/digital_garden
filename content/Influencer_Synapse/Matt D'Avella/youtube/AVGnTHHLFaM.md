## Transcript
 Welcome back to the ground up show I'm your host Matt DiVella and this is episode 27 with Gamal Prather Gamal Prather is the creator and founder behind original article and the instead company The former is a design studio and the latter is a vegan baking company He even brought some samples with me and yes, I will be expecting every future guest to bring me cookies If you don't I'm gonna be heavily disappointed that conversation in just a moment But first if you like this podcast and you liked minimalism A documentary about the important things. I've got something that you might enjoy I recently conducted interviews with the creators and producers of minimalism Josh and Ryan from the minimalist.com as well as Jeff Marlotte and Dave from a company called Spire We really go back and dig deep into What it took to make this film those mistakes and missteps who made along the way as well as everything that we did right I think it's probably gonna be valuable for anybody who is either trying to create something big themselves or Somebody who's just curious about what it took to make this film There's a lot of behind the scenes stuff that you might not have known about the film if you want those interviews I'd love to give them to you all you need to do is leave a review of the ground-up show on iTunes and Send that review a screenshot of it to hello at Matt DiVella.com And I will immediately send you those links to watch the interviews and now without further ado This is episode 27 of the ground-up show All right, welcome back to the ground-up show from all thanks for being with us here Thanks for having excited to have you you're somebody who loves to tinker and play around and experiment with things Tell me a little bit about what you currently do and and what your passion is right now. I work A lot of the time as an industrial designer which for folks that don't know what that is because it's a weird name For a discipline these it sounds like something that it's not quite but my design consumer products beyond that I also have a company called the instead company which are taglines instead of that eat this and by hour I mean my it's really just me You know I have a lot of people helping with things just with sort of general console and people packing and making product for me But yeah, so that's that's becoming more front-end center and it sort of started off as something I as a hobby and People started costing me it dinner parties like yo You should sell this I don't know you and you should sell this yeah, which again at my background's an engine in mechanical engineering and so a lot of the way I've persuaded a lot of that discipline is figuring out Why something won't work and when you apply that thinking to your life You find yourself not doing a lot of things a reasons to not do things that you might otherwise have done and enjoy Because you're trying to be safe and practical and those kinds of things, so you know, it's it's a balance like lots of other parts of life So I think as the older I get the more conservative that conservative I get and the more cautious I get Yep, which is Which I feel like you have to constantly put yourself in check because it's very easy to just kind of coast along when you find out Something's working. So to do something different something new and something that you could Epicly fail at it's kind of hard to do it is it is and I think one of the the things that I think is important For people to realize too is that what I'm doing now is is a direct product of What I've done previously, which I suppose is obvious, but I don't think it was to me because I think I I used to listen to podcasts and you see people in interviews I had this insight that Basically That's pretty cathartic for people to listen to because it's people sort of reflecting on life and Not necessarily what they've achieved but just how they've gotten to where they are to do what they do or something like that It's easy to talk about things and to you know what I mean But to have gone to have done them is different right because you know, you're crying your frustrated You know what I mean you don't know what you're doing all those kinds of things So I definitely like talking about those things because that is Super real Yeah, it is as far as is just the struggle and I mean that in a very first world kind of way, but sure struggles on the less and I do you sometimes forget too When I look back at a project you see the final outcome everybody else sees the final outcome In a lot of ways there's parallels to social media where you see that final photo and you're like wow It's beautiful. It's been a straight line right to that. It has been super easy not even Dude, it's really hard making stuff and that's what this podcast is about it's about it's called the ground-up show So it's about people building something from nothing. Yeah, and the struggles that you need to overcome to get somewhere And I think there is the element of individual projects big projects small projects as well as somebody's own journey And I think that there is so many struggles along the way and that's why I was really excited when I got the Facebook Messenger Ping about like hey, do you want to do this and I was like absolutely that's that's all I'm trying to scream at people is Not that it's hard, but like it's Be advised. It's going to be hard Generally worth it. Yeah, so do it keep going whatever your crazy ideas you should try it because it the first one Three five seven might not work But somewhere in there it's like if you if you're at it that long something's probably gonna work Like you're gonna get smart enough. You're gonna start asking the questions and finding the people that have the information to help you get To whatever you're trying to get to yeah To validate 90 or something right the hardest thing is Understanding when something is Genuinely not working or you need to keep working harder Yeah, because there's there's not a playbook on that. There's not where other than just you know mentors Yeah, and asking questions and trying to be Not realistic, but just Does this make sense? Yeah, what what am I doing? You know? Yeah, like sometimes you're like what this has never been done before And but maybe that's a reason why you shouldn't do it maybe because it doesn't work maybe because that's a bad idea Yeah, or or a great idea at the wrong time, you know those kinds of yeah So I think if that's why you have to I think awareness is so important. Yeah, so if you're aware of of What's going on both inside yourself and your motivations for creating a project and following through with it That's the most important thing actually a fellow Yogi of mine that I met Late right at the end of last year and he and I sat down at the beginning of 2017 and Hashed out a bit of a marketing plan and a brand synthesis for the instead company and the first thing He asked me his name is Lee and just super helpful and really talented at what he does and he The first thing he asked me was what do you afraid of and I was like oh, I got that that's right I had that at the top of my list too. Lee and the answer is is that I become beholden to the instead Company or to one of my projects or something like that freedom for me is about you know living comfortably enough And really not having to do anything or especially for at the beginning of something when it's not making any money As the instead of company is not making money That's and that's I had to get at peace with that that I'm not gonna sell every cookie I make or that even that is made at the factory now Once I got over that it stopped it looked different to me and But so now I always tell people like it's the kind of company where I like I don't think I would ever try to sell I'm because people say oh, you're gonna sell it for a million Maybe but I doubt it what's occurred to me more Recently is that I might take the decency Sorry the recipes and license them to huge things So because to me it's like well, I don't really want to dilute my brand I mean I do want it to be accessible and affordable for everyone in a Super in a highly plebian pedestrian kind of way But right now that's not real that's not real right now So what's the fast ride is like man? I could license this to Ralphs because they have a cool organic brand or to vans or to know anything like that Yeah, you could sell this thing You could build it up to be really big and then sell it and then get this like whole like load a money But then what right then you have all this money and then you don't have a company and then where's your passion? What are you gonna do then and it's like I think it sounds nice to a lot of people and and for a lot of people that are struggling Having that money and security would help them a lot But having a thriving business and and having a company that makes you money or having a job Is a damn good start at finding happiness because of your ability yeah others and is helpful to you know if if everything is moving right or you can't rely on Pretty critical things like financial resources Yeah, I think that pulls the foundation out from other other things just practically in life like not necessarily in your head But practically that may become exceptionally challenging and then The mental side of your life may start to spin away from you because you're frustrated or things just about These very critical life pieces, you know right so so you've got the instead company You've got original article. Yeah, that's the design stuff's called the original article That's so that's sort of design consultancy of one of freelancer and or I'm trying to position myself more now as an artist I have a society at that You know if I'm gonna get commissioned to do something at the rate that I want to be commissioned to do things at I would be smarter to position myself as an artist than as a designer because it's like thinking in corporate American terms You know the decision makers and stay called as that are higher up the chain I suppose They're like well, we have a stable you have a whole stable of designers over there they make things But when the artist comes in The artist is talking you know I'm saying right and so I'm happy to try to Work that because I want to do great things with really big companies that again I have Infrastructure and distribution for kind of anything they Sometimes just don't have the greatest ideas or like they have so many tiers of management that It makes a really pure clean in the moment Right now kind of idea not viable image Identity how you present yourself in the world is really really important and I think sometimes when you take on like a cultural countercultural lifestyle like minimalism People think that labels are Totally bad we should never use them but I don't agree with that I think you should use them to your advantage and when I originally Switched from Matt Diavella videographer to Catalyst studios That's a huge shift for how I'm perceived in the world and what I can charge yeah companies And which companies are willing to work with me because even though it's just still a little may Making videos they see something differently right and I don't lie to people and I don't pretend like I'm not just one person If they ask me I'll tell them and like yeah, I hire other people when I get a budget I'll hire other people You'll just come on yeah and build a team from there But how you present yourself is really important and I think because like if you go on a first date and You don't Like you don't wear a t-shirt Right or you're maybe wearing sandals or maybe you're wearing a button up and a suit and a tie You know there's different spectrums there where you could make a mistake that probably doesn't represent yourself in the best way Or is going to lead to a successful outcome on that date sidebar on that note? I was at a recording of the moth over in Echo Park not that long ago and They had you make little teams that were gonna fire questions at the person and one of the team names was cargo shorts on a first date That's really good. It's like oh Yeah, that's over there. You know what that that's advice from my friend Zach Weston. He has been wearing cargo shorts It's his entire life and he wears him and it's the only kind of shorts he has okay It's like just get a couple pairs of shorts without pockets Maybe just one pair. Yeah, just try it out of my work. So I'm curious about how you got started is You know have you always been into making things when does your stories start? less less about making things you know it definitely starts with my with my mom You know I was raised in a two parent home Born in Jersey grew up mostly in Cincinnati both parents around have my grandma around and Very supportive great education system. So thank you Wyoming city schools and Really you know, so my grandma and mom grew up pretty poor and so my grandma had to make a lot of things Her self-close Eventually she became a realtor and you know had to kind of do some construction herself on houses and make that Garage into an apartment. You know things so she became handy quickly and so my mom picked up a lot of that And I picked up a lot of that from her. So one of the stories I like to tell is that when we lived in New Jersey We didn't have any trees with branches low enough to have a tree house So my mom was like, well, it's build one because I keep driving by these things out on the highway You see that place that Place over on the side in the cornfield or whatever and she's like I can make that She's like so we went out there one day. She took measurements and we went to the hardware store And then went home and built one like and don't don't have a table saw But we have a circular saw that we've turned upside down and put it on like saw horses and like made a table saw So she was a very resourceful that way and so I say a lot that she could have been an engineer If that was a bit more of what women were encouraged or you know if society looked at it that differently at the time She would have been an epic engineer So I think that's where a lot of that part of my mind comes from and a lot of the social Things I think came from my dad because he's He's hyper social and just very good with people So I was kind of how I got started just kind of kicking stuff around the house and you know I would take old TVs at part yeah because they're screwdrivers and I knew how to use them and And it wasn't like I then cobbled something cool out of them. It was like nope now It's just taking a part yeah I know it's inside it now. Yeah, did your parents support that or were they like I'm taking a part the TV? No, no that that was that was totally fine for them You know as long as it wasn't the real one, you know, that's right they didn't care But you know in high school I did pretty well in math and science after I'd like to tell the story to that I went to Sylvan Learning Center when I lived in New Jersey because I would have temper tantrums When I couldn't get the math problem right and it was more that like it just that it wasn't this smooth linear I got right to the answer that I made a misstep somewhere just couldn't handle it who had no capacity to handle that so from that became Good at math and physics and was then sort of ushered into engineering is that something that has held on through Out the years or do you still get frustrated when you're not picking stuff up? No, um these days Hope this one's on arrogant like I'm generally kind of a quick study on on certain things again There's a certain way that I know that I like to have a framework of understanding a new thing and once I have that I come good. I'm not saying I'm gonna go do brain surgery But most things don't trip me up that badly. It's really more like I really like asking questions and people tell me a lot like man. Yes, really good questions Like as I'm thinking really hard about how to figure out this thing and so I've become better Asking questions to really get the very specific Peace that I feel like I'm missing to understand how all this links together Do you find that a lot of these skills that you learned early on? We're building blocks. So once you learn something you learn math or you learn some of these sciences You can apply them in other ways. Yeah, and even just sort of the basic idea of math is you know as you advance farther into Studying math into calculus from algebra and all those kinds of intriguing geometry Into linear algebra and robotics type of math you just see that this is just building blocks It's just stuff stacked on top of other stuff. So if you're not that great at trigonometry or algebra Like yeah, calculus is going to be pretty tough, but once you understand those foundational things You know, it's not sorcery, you know, like it's it's pretty straightforward so And I think that's that's the downside of math is a lot of people just have this perception and therefore They don't think they can do it and then they can't do it You know, and I think the same is true about creativity where I used to I I definitely believe that like if you weren't born Knowing how to draw you weren't going to be good at drawing period But then I went to graduate school struggle through that first year like not knowing how to draw in a bunch of classes with Youngsters, you know kid you know people four years younger than me that were They could draw better than me with their off-hand, you know with their bad hands like easily better than me So it's pretty humbling because I did well in engineering, but this is a whole new set of stuff that I love But was not good at it at first, but you know at a Friend in school named Nathan that was a year ahead of me and was materials engineer and he's like dude This is probably the first sort of new age you were kind of you got to believe kind of thing Where I was like Ever but any and he wasn't again he was an engineer so He was like man you got to stop saying I can't draw this He's like he's like I know that sounds weird and stupid and just really simple But just try not saying that and just Let's try that and You know from there you start to get better right you start to believe and then from there you You kind of take more risks and you don't worry about so much if that line is perfectly straight if that's circle's perfect or why do you think we have that Built in doubt I wonder if it's Somehow related to when parents are saying to their children at any age you know be careful watch yourself right you you sort of have just a I think that's kind of just Overlaid on to us right thinly, but again and again. It's just be careful watch it. Don't fail Don't don't don't because because because I haven't I may be having given you the tools to To deal with failure Right, and I don't even realize that as a parent or something like you know I mean I think it's that kind of thing where yeah, it's this have a habitual like oh, I'm gonna pull back I'm gonna withhold a little bit You know yeah, I think you have to be okay with failing and actually screwing up and being bad and I think when you Coddle and when you that are the helicopter parent and trying to make sure everything is okay. Yeah, I think that actually That doesn't help at all. Yeah, make I think that would make you hypersensitive to when things are not okay. Yeah, and also you know of course You know you children generally do what their parents are doing as opposed to what they're saying and so Yeah, if you parent do not handle certain types of stress well. Well, there you have it like I still have a thing with a and I cracked the code on how this works with computers that drive me crazy I think in my head at some point I have I had written out the sentence that because it's a machine it will work the same every time I now know at age 37. That's definitely not true I've used plenty of software programs that had that are all the evidence that that is not a fact and so I think there's part of me There's like no this is supposed I clicked on the thing and it's supposed to Extrude or loft or whatever and it doesn't do it and I am I feel Slighted in some way and that's why I get so mad like This year I can count probably four times that I've done the fist Trying to break my desk in half because I'm so I because I need to get this done like right now and my computer is for sure not helping me out And it that just drives me So it's because I'm like this is this beautiful machine that's so amazing and it Levitates above the desk and but it's not doing very basic things like opening the file. I feel like normally I have really good patience and I am really good keep my cool when a computer when the apple does the Spinny thing and when it's I'm trying to edit a project and I'm like so this actually just happened on Wednesday So I'm getting ready for to release a podcast and I woke up early woke up at 5am and I was like All right, I just got to make these final edits and then compress it and then I can post every line Yeah, and then it's just taking forever to load the freeze is up. I got to exit out restart the computer go over again You can feel it like we can feel like oh, no, oh, it's doing okay. All right You know what to the computer's credit. It's gotten a lot better I'm gonna have that kind of high school that like computers crashing all the time I would edit on final cut and they didn't have an autosafe So it would be Command S Command S Command S like every minute and it would be did something right because you have a couple times where you just lose everything Yep, you lose three hours worth of work and then redoing three hours of the work or more is the most frustrating thing It is and so what I know is from having to had that experience as well that happened you get through that Redoing it much more quickly and you might do a little bit better because you know you just done it before right and just recently but yeah, I think What used to misdefining grad school when I first was really around a lot of creative types for the first time in my life They didn't seem to learn that lesson Like it took me exactly once of like losing everything when I was like, oh Oh, that's it. I didn't realize that was possible. I will be saving every five minutes Not a problem doly-noted universe. I got it. This is before I was talking to the universe, but Yeah, I just didn't it didn't take me long to learn that lesson, but there's constantly a design like In the background lost something yeah, didn't save just in the moment. I respect that But you also have to be practical and understanding your tools work. Yeah, yeah I feel like you you can't make the same mistake twice or you shouldn't allow yourself to make the same mistake twice Yeah, sometimes yeah, it's nice to have the The Superman float above you and be like, oh, that's what's happening right now. Okay, cool cool. Yeah, you know I'm not gonna freak out about it. So yeah, there was I just did a podcast recently where this camera behind me the one that was on the guest He was a filmmaker Name's donation and he's like the Iris just shut. I think the camera turned off I was like oh, yeah, and then I look at it and then it's like cardbell function and it doesn't work. Yeah, and I'm like shit So that's why I got the GoPro up here right now because I'm like I need a backup. Yeah Just in case because I I want to have video videos a big part of this podcast sure and if I have no video I feel like It's I'm not I'm not focusing on my strengths and focusing on what I want this podcast debate Yeah, it's not the deliverable you want to present that's one thing. There's a Tim Ferriss as a podcast and he always has a backup recording Yeah, for his podcast. He always brings an extra one and I'm probably gonna start doing that I totally should I haven't had that mistake happen yet, right? So it's like if I end up losing an entire recording You better bet every single episode after that. There's gonna be an extra mic there will be redundancies Yeah, yeah, so do you do that with with your work is there other ways in which you backup your Projects or do you I'm heavily reliant on Google drive hasn't steered me wrong. Well, it has steered me wrong But so I'm about to start a podcast. I think about that's largely based around design rants like I think I emailed to you Because of these things were I'm like who is in the room making these decisions where they're like Should Google drive should be able to like link multiple accounts to your Google drive like that That's stupid. We want to have that other little tiny company that that can make that software Want them to have a shot, I guess no Google buy them up or something and just make it work how like I'm an entrepreneur I have like four businesses. Can you please Address my needs for heaven's sake like it might be I feel like it might be only one I can't imagine that's like I just got in touch for me. So I can't imagine that I am yeah I feel like a lot of times They're probably designing something Just with they're saying oh a majority of people have single accounts right so we're not gonna design something and and I guess what I want it to get into doing is like I want to find the folks at these companies that make these decisions and just say Because I just practically like if that's gonna take another 105 hundred thousand dollars of development so that I can do two accounts or three accounts instead of just the one Cool like if that's not part of the business plan don't I get it But I if I don't know that I'm gonna assume that that takes Google right who has all the money that should take you 30 40 seconds Iron out and now I have what I want and I'm seeing your praises. Yeah, I actually was in the room with those people because I did a documentary called design disruptors Where we interviewed with Google Airbnb Facebook Twitter and we got to speak with like their heads of design in the design I wish I brought you along and we could have really put them to this talk at all the questions But it's I think It's it's complicated. I think the hardest thing When you talk about these big companies like Google is that when they make a decision it affects millions and millions of people Sure, so if they roll out a change yeah, then Save a company like Salesforce, which is business space these are for Businesses if they roll something out and they have to retrain all their users to figure it out Then that's gonna cost these companies millions of dollars. I And I can get with that and I fit and in my mind the things that I'm usually trying to convince a company to do Aren't those are not those things? Which was like y'all have to train anybody on anything new to get multiple more accounts to link to my Google drive Like that's it's just it's just more or that the other thing that drives me nuts is that a A company will implement a new feature a new way of doing a process and completely jettison the old one is if that Completely was useless and worked for no one. I say just add it is add another way So that those of us that are power users that really like doing it a certain way for some probably of Securities and that they haven't even realized Can still do what we were doing yeah, and it's not like you know that the Mickey Mouse new toy version that you know That everyone can use like that's great Make that for them. I'm not opposed to that, but please don't take away my super beautiful Workflow that I've honed over 13 years You know I'm saying so yeah, but you know slave to the tools You stay we were talking earlier before the podcast set your your apartment gets a little bit messy, but does your Digital world since you you work so much with computers and design These 3D tools are you Really well organized and you have a really great workflow in terms of your online system yeah overall it's pretty ironed out You know I mean they're they're distinct Ridiculousness is with it within the the workflow like my my 3D printers in my bedroom And that's attached to a Mac that I don't use anymore and So I have I just email files to myself And and that's yeah, dude Yes, it's so funny how I do that there's a wide range of that thing now or there's probably something I can dongle to the 3D printer that will make it wireless That I just haven't had five minutes to go look at because I can just email it and it's over there and I hit print and it's gone So sometimes to keep the the forward motion of things is something I struggle with like I get distracted I have them I'm like I got a lot of tabs open and at least one of my four accounts, you know what I mean? So but I mean overall I'd say it is a very digital thing industrial design can absolutely be a highly physical Endeavor as far as how many samples you need in place to put prototypes depending on with the scale of those are I think it is I tend to work on small things But you know, I think of the first place I worked in in Connecticut called product ventures. They Learned a ton of stuff there. I meant some great people and I really got a lot better at drawing actually there I say forced to do draw a certain way and We had something called the blue sky lounge Which was literally these blue core get plastic doors four six of them and it's like all the Sort of rubber made containers you can imagine of all the packaging all the packaging that People at the company had collected from trips over 20 years and I'm always free at the Peter always come out at the owner would come out and say where is the Israeli wipes? You know, and that is the Israeli wipes hub and the was the other one the the dancey bottle that's what he called is this bottle that I describe it it goes like this like it just has a sort of weird swoopy thing and he just that was like his favorite reference and like my buddy Rashman roommate at the time Aaron managed that part of that business and would have like go dig This freaking sample. So it can be very physically demanding From a space standpoint, but I've worked pretty hard to make it not that way for myself because I work from home Yeah, I feel the same way with the the filmmaking gear is this you there are so many cables Cords wires batteries battery chargers. There's so much Stuff that I have and even as a minimalist it can get overwhelming and we're prepping for a shoe I will lay it all out on the apartment floor and figure okay any that and you that I don't need that and then put it in the bags that I need yeah I think in an ideal world it I would have an office where I'd have a rack Yeah, and there would be all the gear neatly organized and then I could take it out and put it in the bags I need to when I'm preparing for a trip, but I or a shoot, but I feel like no matter what There's always gonna be a little bit of chaos and I think that's life in general is that Whether it's your desktop or it's your apartment floor it gets a little bit messy sometimes Yeah, and then you just have to every week or so So time and put it back clear it figure it out and when you have less stuff and when you're more intentional It's easier to clear that stuff out. Yeah, and I would say like for example Like my digital like file system which is just folders. It's not like a use of special thing for that I'd say that's that's Pretty tidy. I don't know too many other creatives that have a system that Is as ironed out as mine and I say that from having looked at other people's computers and then like Wow, how do you find this is why it takes you so long to do things sometimes you know I mean and like I can find any file of any project I worked on in probably 10 or 20 seconds that's amazing. That's what I do with my because I have so many hard tries Probably about like 20 to 30 hard drives and most of them two terabytes some of them 10 to 16 terabyte stuff Yeah, it's a lot of data. It's unreal actually what I've been doing lately is because Hard drives don't last forever so I'll have these old hard drives that were one terabyte That one 500 gigabytes from college even yeah because I don't want to delete it because I like keeping everything It's just nice to have those projects and as we were talking about before It's not that hard to keep a digital stuff. It's physical, but So what I'll do is I reallocate those to a new hard drive so maybe I'll buy a 10 terabyte hard drive and then put 10 old hard drives into that one but then I'll also I have to so I'm not gonna I use actually right on it I would like either do one of these laminated things right on by hand what was on that thing I don't know hard drive but sometimes it changes sometimes you delete projects and it's always changing so I started a Google spreadsheet And I have each hard drive listed okay, so if I'm like a client is from three years ago So say hey by the way, do you have that you know a clip from such and such shoot? Yeah, and I just pop up the Google spreadsheet do out and then I find it and then I can pull it up And the biggest benefit of that is just like I fuel organized I feel like if right anybody came to me and asked me for a project I wouldn't have to stress that but shit. I got to go through 20 hard drives to find that Much less know if I have what they need in that in that you know, yeah, I agree and I think that's that's the I think to me That was the lesson is like the system doesn't have to be universally the same it just has to work and Be logical and preferably easily explainable to someone else. I've discovered I've a client that has what I would say is a dubious system because the way that they think about Revive I've always bumped up against this when I've worked at places or work just with people independently is The way that people manage revisions and changes of files Yeah, I could probably use your power there is stuff of magic to me Like I've rarely put a date. I just put a rev number on stuff Because if that's it's all I need to know. What is that this one number? I just sort of revision number. It's like oh revision one vision two And then do you do v1 v2 v3? That's basically what it looks like. Yeah, it's just like hyphen space v1 sometimes I'm hesitant to do v1 because I'm really confident that I just knocked it out of the pot Oh first time and that the client's gonna look at him be like wow this is v like this is the only v Right because then if you say v1 then they're gonna start thinking like maybe we should ask him for changes But I feel like you're not gonna get out of that no matter what right right. Yeah, that's always coming And did you used to have this process as well where was it a little bit chaotic? Yeah, oh yeah, I've just if I I tell people I should put it on my website because I think it's funny And it's true. It's like there's no final. I don't want to see final. Oh my god anywhere in a file name ever in your life Don't send me that because it's not final because now final I mean even if you put like to me it's like it'll be like v47 space To production or to you know To client Like whatever it's not final like because until I'm dead or you know I mean like so I'm always asked me for a change. That's a curse Yeah, I don't want it is asking for an extra version. Oh, yeah, I've done that and I still do it I still get into that habit um and then I write final on it and then a client will be like In it all right we need to we need to make a quick change. Oh, can we just do a little bit of alteration on this? Oh, can we change the end tagline and I'm like final v2 right right Final v3. Yeah, it's like yeah, you get into these substructures within a file name and and then it becomes a little confusing How do you this is a little bit nitty gritty, but for me I sometimes mess up where I have a couple versions internally with myself So I would that's what's hard for me. Is that do you send a client then V3 as the first version or do you read no no? What I mean yes, I would I would it's like That rarely trips them up. I do rarely ever talk about it honestly, but I tend to make Reference in an email like well, and you know and in the v01 file the v07 file whatever you know It was it looked like this screenshot, but in the v22 file looks like this screen you know I mean and just so that there is some kind of reference point for them that But yeah, yeah, it's one of those things that I know if I'm diligent enough about it It's it's usually enough to carry the project and we don't lose things or we don't get completely confused about what which Version we're talking about yeah, I think that's good advice is to just if you're gonna Work on projects internally to yourself start by just keep the same structure throughout and don't send somebody Rechange it because that's what I would do sometimes is because I want them to think it's v1 for whatever reason Oh, I think it actually looks good. It looks better to say v3 because then they know that you work through I'm shit, right? Yeah, and that this wasn't just Yeah, that's not just thing I thought box here. It is yeah, yeah, I think that It's one of those things I conversation I like when I speak to students which I'm trying to get to be more frequently like to me that matters That matters as much as like whether you're on an Apple or PC like that sort of transcendence what platform you're on It's like you can find files or you can't don't waste time like it's just not a thing worth Wasting your life on because you're gonna the time it takes to set up a system that works for you and to in You know pay attention and evolve it over time That amount of effort. I think is or time it takes is Consulate orders of magnitude smaller than what it is to be like, oh, I got to find the file Yeah, there's this there's this mentality that to create it. I can be quick and while letting my feet Nope, you're gonna make a mess. Don't do it. Yeah, there's this mentality that to be creative is to have chaos Surrounded you paper is scattered everywhere To have a desktop that's just cluttered with nonsense and and probably files and screenshots from years ago And I've found that to be the biggest impediment to actually creating something Yeah, and I say all the time when I'll I'll be on the phone as a client emails Me like I'll look at this blah blah blah and I'll say hold on just a second I got to put it where it goes and I find that with my desk physical desk Usually I have a ton of clutter there because I don't have shelves I don't have buckets and bins and I know that I need them now It's the same kind of thing where you know you they say You walk the path before you pay it or whatever like on a college campus You kind of see where people walk first and how they get to the buildings and then you put the pass in You know before you get yeah, that's okay Very easy before we start pouring concrete. Let's figure out what we actually need versus what we Think we need or what looks pretty on that page or what you know what I mean Right, so maybe take a you know a couple weeks Assess and see how you actually yeah, I mean I'm on desk at my apartment. I'm on desk V5 I think I've been I've been I do kind of once a year I'm like all right, this is what isn't working about this for me like I want to be standing I don't want to be standing or I want there to be nothing under it You know why so I can clean more easily You know like if I don't have stuff on the floor I'm much more likely to clean the floor and not you know I'm in their test baking stuff All the time So it's like my floor is get dirty and if I don't clean the floors that's gross So I can try to facilitate Behaviors for myself so that like even in my living room like my living room kitchen are sort of connected And it's like I'm trying to get as many things off the floor, so it's as easy as possible for me to sweep and mop You know, it's funny is because we're like robots We actually don't like because we're not always conscious of the things we're doing So it's funny that we have to set up our apartment or our home in a way that we're gonna do what we want to us to do and I think that's one of those things about life That's probably kind of taken for granted, you know, and but I think a bit just a bit of attention I'm not like learn about design but like just a bit of attention to that might really change how your day goes Or that thing I'm always fighting with when I get out the door or whatever Man, like maybe move the table down five inches you might not catch your your bag on it every time you walk You know what I mean like that's the type of like and intention and awareness that I'm trying to always cultivate is like Because those are things that like start to Flare up and get out of control like the rest of my day. I might be rude to someone because that thing just happened and you know I'm always I'm trying to like always put those little silly fires out and like not get mad about things that Definitely don't matter, you know what I mean? Yeah, I recently dumped a smooth like a pretty healthy smoothie All over all down my center console all down and it's and it's yeah, it's and it's it's like caked onto the seeds like and there's The old me was furious furious about that new me's like All right Let me remember next time to put the top on actually and not visually Yeah, but when you look at it move on when you look at instance I think it does matter everything that led up to that throughout the day So if you had all these other instances in your life where you were frustrated where the door wouldn't close or where your lock was jammed or whatever It's just these things will build up and fester and then when that Happens and you've had a bad day. You might be like And then you know you might actually react in a way that is in socially appropriate right right and I think that's the thing to Is to is to try to think about how to um Yeah, how to mitigate those things that drive you crazy and to be aware of them because most of that stuff is just Doesn't really matter you know and that's what I'm gonna say is that it feels like the world is happening to like things are happening to you It's like me versus the world But I now realize that I contributed to that smoothie dump because I didn't put the thing on because I wasn't paying attention I should pay more attention not man. This is a crappy day. No, I should pay more attention and then it won't be a crappy day Yeah, take responsibility for this shit that happens to you and the shit that you do right and I think a lot You know a lot of stuff does happen to people for sure when people yell racist things like that happened to you That's not about you and that's the other thing. That's not about you. That's about that person and I think I ironically I think I saw this on Instagram as a little quote. There's like when you when something happens to you And there's something does someone does something rude to you and your first thought is Man, I wonder what's going on with that person that did that to me You're headed in the right direction Because you realize that when people do things like that that's I would I now days say things like that's not the natural state I don't think that's how we Are naturally I think we have enough of these like little perturbations throughout the day like little crappy things that happen That's sometimes that again like we say that That pus or bursts open into rudeness or something right so it means something probably happened to that person and like You know, they might need a I mean, it sounds really heavy. They might need a hug or like but they might need some compassion Or they might need some understanding, right? Yeah, and to realize that like when that happens That's not that person not just a dick something probably happened almost certainly something probably happened The thing that I struggle with and then I have to consistently remind myself is Don't let other people control your emotions and if somebody can get in your head if Somebody does something a small as beep their horn at you just happens in LA a lot There is this feeling of well fuck that guy right right right but They just changed my emotional state. They made me change who I am and be angry and be frustrated and outlash All right loud that why loud that happened. I think that's the best way to look at it is that I shouldn't allow these other people and then these thoughts will come up It's kind of like meditation these thoughts are gonna pop up and then you just big It's not just throw away like I don't need that I don't need to actually be a jerk to this person right and actually give them back what they're giving to me Yeah, I mean, yeah, there's there's still a part of me that on certain days feels like I'm ready to burn the bridge Let's just not let's just burn it You know what I mean, but then I think about like no that's that's old thinking like that's not It's not productive you know what I mean and that's just from a it's from an old place you know so Yeah, I just I try to avoid it when we're possible. Yeah, it sounds like You've changed a lot in your life from and you've learned a lot as you've gotten older and How much do you think people can change and a lot of times we think our personalities are so Tightly nope. I think I so I still see myself as large leave the same person But just my approach to certain things that are kind of everywhere has changed a bit and so I think yes people can change 180 you know they make a 180 I guess but I think that's again that's about probably just a few things that Impact a lot of how they see the world and so yeah the change and I would mostly credit the changes I've made to Working with Darcy the life coach and with Doing a lot of yoga and I when I got into yoga it was peorly out of a physical so co exercise it's a good size in the yoga room and the first time I did it was in New York it was hot yoga And I did it because of a woman I was dating I was like let's go to yoga and I was like okay, sure, let's try it and that was humbling and so Yeah, I kind of kept going back and none of the mental benefit which is really why I'm interested in it now None of that became apparent to me until I moved to Los Angeles and probably I've been doing it maybe six years or so probably in year three or four that started to become much more clear What was happening mentally and how it was how not stoic I was but how I say to someone yesterday Like I feel like things hit me now and they just follow the floor like it don't stick in me Don't go through me. You know it's like I I feel a lot more impenetrable to things that again Don't matter that used to seem like they really matter how is yoga help that Because it's on it's weird it's in a way it's like what I remember of going to church where you get in They they tell you things right like they're teaching you not just poses So the first thing I think that really hit me and stuck with me There's a teacher who I haven't seen in quite some time and he was a Mickey Durand and she said Right at the end of practice she was like you're already complete And I was like whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa That's that's not what I was told before And I've only I think I've only tiered up probably twice in all the time These days I'm like a six six seven day we kind of yogi and and again I'm like a main pretty main stream kind of yogi like I'm not I'm not about the Sanskrit Because again, I know I see that Even that while I someone actually broke some science and they're like well a lot of the What's happening in your mouth when you're saying those Sanskrit names of things actually Factor brain from how your tongue is hitting the roof of your mouth. I was like wait what Here's like yeah, I was like oh, okay, so all of a sudden you explain what that is because I I don't so yoga, so I don't know what it stands because so like a gosh, I'm gonna Try to remember one and what the you know the western name is but like say you're in Tadosana The way that your tongue is hitting your mouth and I'm trying to what's in thousand it is that might be mountain which is like you're just basically standing with your arms up over your head and Big proud chest your arms your legs were doing a certain sort of turning inward and so to me as Yeah, so a lot of times there are some teachers that are like everything They're like okay, so now we're gonna move into this pose and they say the Sanskrit word that like I don't know what that means But I'll know frog or I'll know mountain or I'll know pyramid or you know downred dog or upper dog So they're the names for the post sorry, so they're the names for the poses and to me I see that in many ways as a barrier to people that might get a ton of benefit especially mentally out of yoga Because they're like ah, it's that's just like one degree of e-sternness too much for me Yeah, it's a set aside the aesthetic of yoga and yoga studios and What a lot of the decorative elements of that are in a yoga space are I think that's another degree of separate of of disconnect for people So I'm fascinated looking forward at yoga is like well How do I make this a much I want to make it much more technologically advanced and I can talk about that in a minute and also I want to make it more available to more people because of the benefit. I've gotten out of it Which is again forget about the physical stuff. I'm much more interested in what it does to your brain and then therefore how you behave as a result You know what got me into yoga and I said I don't do yoga and I currently don't practice yoga But I've done it a couple of times and what got me into it actually Believe you're not was P90x Really? Yeah, I tried that P90x for a little bit because my brother just like made this massive transformation sure And I was like oh that'd be a fun challenge to just do P90x for whatever however long it was I think it's 90 days But I or no it's like 90 minutes sessions, but it's really intense Yeah, yeah, and I've done it just briefly, but so yeah, yeah, and then the one the last day of the week is yoga and I couldn't get through 10 minutes Yeah, out of the 90 minutes. I was like oh my god. This is crazy tough But I think something like that where it's that is not Positioned as a spiritual practice at all, but it's almost a gateway to get into it and I can see like okay Like this is really tough. I joke around and I made it for my brother and I would ask him how many miles of yoga he ran today But and like you know a lot of people make fun of people for doing yoga, but I It is truly tough and it is it's it's a practice that I could definitely see benefiting me from so many Perspectives from Strictly a physical element. Oh, yeah, and absolutely yeah, I mean I'm Yeah, from a physical standpoint as a pertain to yoga I'm very I'm much more interested in alignment and not injuring myself as I had a risk thing going on I couldn't figure out why my buddy Andrew Explained he's like oh, I'll show me your down dog and when I was in it he'd like went and sort of flicker like flicked my fingers He's like yeah, I shouldn't be able to flick your fingers up like that. He's like so what happens when you press your fingers More strenuously is now you've engaged different muscles here that engage muscles here So now you're loading your sorry now you're loading your your shoulder more correctly And that's why I was getting this real little twinge back here because I was compensating I was injuring myself and didn't really realize it So I think that's one of the things I would tell people's like if you if it feels weird stop doing it and ask a question and and because it almost certainly you're doing something in a way that's Everybody's bodies and that's the thing that I'm really everybody's body is different so Like I designed these yoga blocks which are down here Sorry, oh, you made it I did so I said I designed yoga blocks. It's it's still the same four by six by nine cube I just put words on it trying to keep it simple folks But and now you know that was a big learning process. There's like the simplest thing I've ever created ever ever I mean, it's could not it's a block. You don't have to say but it was a yeah Just that idea it's crazy yet and it done like Trying to communicate like you'll see that these things are miss it like this piece is all off to one side I'm like my document was so beautiful and it kills me is that people Don't necessarily pay attention the way I was expecting them to yeah, right? So the lesson was oh I should either Just have blocks made at the factory in Asia and have them send them to me I should just screen print them here with someone that is going to nail that every time First is getting it right when I feel like it because again, it's I've been to Asia just a couple of times for work and it's it's like there's a cultural difference Someone did a wonderful job of explaining it all to me of of how these miscommunications happen or how they Consider things differently than we do and how that leads to just yeah stuff being misaligned You're like they don't set it back until it's like way off You know what's ironic about the fact that because this piece and it's was to remind you to to be peaceful and then you just get nothing My frustrated. Would you look at it? Yeah, well like and again at this point I'm definitely peaceful with it, but like when I was going through samples and like getting my first samples like we're money Like they did it right once, but did they do it right 500 times? No and that realizations like oh my expectations were too high I've never worked with these folks before And even though I can be clear as a day doesn't mean they're gonna do it right. I got to be honest I don't know what this is Okay, so it's a block right, so what you do the yoga block is it helps sort of extend you to the ground So in general, it's it's helpful to be well-grounded meeting like If I'm gonna come up from like a push-up or like if I'm standing up into you know some standing pose You really want your feet to be well aligned gripping like nice and evenly So because from there again, it's just like with the hands like if you're kind of kind of on it You're gonna compensate for for this imbalance all the way up here all the way up the chain so if you Your feet are grounded properly now now your lower leg and your knee will be supported properly Everything is loaded and your posture gets better and you're able to expand more and that's That's all you're doing you know what I mean so this helps so again. I'm I'm six two So this helps like understanding where I'm like I can't reach the ground and so or two reach the ground I'm gonna have to do something that might not be safe for me to do so Some people I think look at them as like crutches but they're not crutches. They're awesome They make it comfortable sure and not painful and that you don't feel like I'm gonna risk it You know, it's all that's gone when you have props and bolsters and blankets and straps So I was trying to just try to make something that was cool and stylish because literally I wanted I got so into using it at the studio I don't really have a home practice, but I imagine that I would and I was like, well, I want to cool pair of blocks There are no cool blocks. I made them So I mean there's things with like a few little graphics on but nothing I was like, yeah That is I can identify with this product so so I that was what I decided to do and you know I met a guy that Name Adam that that has a great online selling course in this before you had the course You just kind of baiting that and so you had a group of friends all kind of learning how to do this at the same time and I'll be honest This has been pretty much a wash for me like it's not I would not count it as a success financially, which is for sure why why is doing it beyond just trying to get a cool product out there But you know, I learned a ton doing it and you know and again that feeds into what I'm doing with the instead company So when I was saying before that a lot of the stuff is stacked on itself Yeah, you're probably gonna go through some stuff break even lose a little money But you want the things he said to me when I was really frustrated He's like he's like you have to be glad that you're learning like a $1,000 lesson He's like that same lesson that you're learning I learned for 30,000 dollars and doing the same Amazon type thing He's like I wanted that for 30,000 Right, so yeah, I was like hmm yeah, I've made those mistakes myself. Yeah, I made those mistakes where My first office in in Hoboken I'll call that a $10,000 mistake I was like oh, I want to I was living in Hoboken at the time and I had this infatuation That I needed an office right having an office space would make me legitimate and it would be so great to be able to Separate my personal life from my business life and so many other things that I rationalized to make this seem like the best idea in the world And then I got an office space and From day one it was the were the most frustrating thing I'd ever done because then I had to do things that I didn't like doing which was decorate the office I had to get the internet. I had to figure out the blinds for the the building because there was direct sunlight pouring in Okay, I had to figure out security because the day that I moved in the woman a woman next door to me says Oh, yeah, you probably shouldn't leave your computers here because we had a break in the other day And then I was like this is great because I have tens of thousands of dollars of equipment Right, I guess now I'm keeping this at my apartment right you know, obviously I probably could have went about all this in a better way and I could have gotten the right place for me But what it came down to for me what I realized was that the Space isn't as important if it's just yourself Right, it's if you want to get an office space for your business It should be to collaborate with other people to network and meet with other people and it needs to be comfortable for you to be able to work from there You have to take into certain things certain things a new account like how long is it going to take me to get to work Am I going to have to pack a lunch now? Is there a kitchen where I can cook and do all this stuff because Yeah, just zoom out a little bit from this thing that you may be a bit infatuated with right yeah And sometimes you got to actually make the mistakes yourself I think a lot of times we can learn from our mentors and learn from other people So we don't have to make the mistakes but sometimes we just dig our heels in and we're like I just got to do it Yeah, and then so I I spent $10,000 over the course of the year on this office space and then By the end of it, I was like I was Fresh it with myself, but at the same time I was happy to be out of it and be like all right. Yeah, I learned that mistake Yep, I won't do that again and I've since I've had office spaces and I've used we works and stuff That's been more affordable and more appropriate for the work I was doing and a lot of me to connect and meet with new people So there's certainly the right way to do it, but a lot of times just got to make the mistakes and like you said Sometimes just yeah, I didn't waste 50,000 dollars You know what I mean? It was it for me. It was it was okay like all right I'm not gonna it doesn't totally screw me over. Yeah, I can use it as a write-off write-ups or the best thing in the world for making business mistakes Shout to my friend Seth who I met through the internet about design dorkery He just put in touch with it with a countenance sounds like it's going to be amazing Which is a very sort of entrepreneurial small business like oh, that's amazing thing to be excited about Excited about a countenance because it's it's the kind of thing that like I just don't want to do I generally have you been doing it yourself yourself? No, I had I had I was with a company that Has been helpful in certain ways, but not and others and I Decided to advocate for myself. I suppose in as much as I was like all right They're really nice people and they definitely do my taxes well But they I would love for them to give me a different heads up about certain things and then I almost got charged a bunch of money You've had a nowhere for just like what how did it go up by a factor of 10? You know I'm broke right when you find the right people You know it yeah, I could tell the second I talked to this this fell on the phone It's just it was like no look passes like it was great. Yeah, I agree like I think you do have to focus on What you love to do especially when you're doing your own thing and running your own business and yeah Sometimes you can get by doing the accounting stuff, but like a lot of times I'm like it's not the word worth the risk for me to do it myself because I don't want the blowback I don't like it and also if I screw up, I'm gonna screw up bags and that's Uncle Sam the concept for you consequences Yeah, I don't throw you in jail if you don't do your taxes when did you decide to start working on your own Worked in New York for four years doing the IRA design thing predominantly on Nike's brand, which is Amazing and I got to learn so much. I got so much better at 3D, which is now the very center of what I see as my toolset and Got tired of being in New York and moved to California. Hey, me, too Made it out. I moved out here in July July 25th so work about a month and a half ago. Okay. I love it here, man. I I First moved to Santa Barbara for about nine months now. I worked at a studio there where I met my business former business partner and still very good friend Darious and I'm ever standing in my back porch in Santa Barbara crying my eyes out because I was so scared to like try to go to LA with There isn't try to do this thing that I definitely don't know how to do. I mean, I know how to do design. I will out design Most people that's so that's where all my high school competitiveness has gone isn't to like I'll I'll design I will out design you son myself, yeah, but But you know, we made the leap and it's kind of a pretty typical story from why I've come to understand but basically we went to a trade show and drew up our little business cards got a little portfolio together and we that studio that we both worked at always goes to CES or usually goes to CES They consume electronic show in Vegas trying to jump up business So Darious was kind of the black sheep at that studio known who he was there or what he was doing because he wasn't really designed He's more like the more like office managers client relations kind of guy but had design degrees and So he kind of just disappeared into the crowd and I got a text like All right meet me in the conference room, whatever I'm the CEO, you're the creative director. Let's do this We meet this couple that owns a company that makes like a lot of tech type things computer accessory type things Central and South America They look for Lauren to put it mildly in their booth like there's no design involved like we stamp logos on stuff and that is all and So Darious like yeah, we can do all this stuff and so that was our first client So also the brilliance of having a business partner sometimes they know how to do things. You don't know how to do for example In this meeting they say oh, let's let's go to your office and In Los Angeles because Darious is told that we have an office that we don't Dammit, Darious and it so I chat a brick and Darious These French smooth French style says oh We should come to your operation in Mexico and meet your staff see your facility and they're like that's a great idea come on down. They fly us first class put us in a five star hotel and I was like what just Happened that's a Jedi mind track right there I've had the same thing happen to me where clients would ask me Hey, can we come uh watch you you guys edit and and come to your by your studio right and at the time Living in my parents basement close to my session. Well, let me just sorry. Let me uh that's my mom See if she's okay with you coming by because I gotta just let them know about guests And then you just figure out a way to figure out it. You'll tell them the truth. No, no, no And I know I'm not into you know misleading clients, but You know when you live with your parents or when you're when you sometimes you can yeah, sometimes sometimes And it's and it's I think if it's coming from the right place which in this particular instance Absolutely what's like we're definitely trying to help this company for sure because they needed help What I probably would have done if I was Darious would be not to tell them I had a studio I think that there's ways to not lie and He's like he's a Laura's more kind of guy though. Yeah, and I'm I'm not a It works with the minimalism. I'm not a more is more kind of guy so So he was he had like the full court press of like what we can do what we have All that kind of stuff and I'm I'm a much more modest about it and I try to let the work speak I think there are certain people where their confidence will take them Very very far. I'm a kind of person that's like I probably have to work twice as hard as that person because I'm not having oh I haven't oversold it. I'm not that good at selling so I'm like I'm just gonna let it speak for itself So then you work really needs to speak for itself. Yeah, and I've learned actually with the cookie thing Let's look at some of his cookies. So actually yes, so we got some stuff here Sorry about that so these are 3D prints in oh shit get out of here So this is what would be on in location in a store? No, that's that's The actual branding it. Yeah, so this is the actual product here in this bag All right, so looks like that's what's in the store on a shelf. Dude. That's beautiful. Thank you I um, you know I say all the time this is what you can do with Amazon and a design degree now So I get the bags currently off of Amazon from an awesome supplier and I'm Very close to moving into you know fully printed bags with these are stickers on a bag. I print the stickers myself When you first look at it and then once you mention it, I know it is Nobody would ever notice that right and so and and again that's where a bit of some hungry can make one yeah Yeah, yeah, and just go ahead and unscrew the top there and so this is kind of it's Originally it was an idea for my girlfriend She's like well, you need kind of a sampled or displayed a sort of genius show to people Or really more we were talking about it more as a as a countertop display more like a promo item like hey if you buy three cases You get you can you get this cool three printed stand that you can just leave out and maybe sell the cookies for a buck or a 50 cents to someone or you just sample them for free It's worked much more effectively as a as a sales tool for me to try to sell them into Different retail shops or restaurants because you know people get thought they're they really dig the design thing and I'm trying to do this very clean Transparencing by the way Thank you. This is like and I'm gonna show you what I would I show accounts all the time that I walk into like that like the love is is real Is this tattoo a cupcake? That's amazing. That's so cool Which I can actually tell the funny story of that so I've been baking the long time my mom got me started My grandma got you know helped her learn how to bake and so Actually, so I told you before I almost got married when I lived in New York and so we were not we're not doing the ring thing And we For you man good for you trying to talk knack out of it I mean there there just I We just were like there are so many other things that we could spend that money on like a house or something or down here on a house or something like that that that seemed more practical to us and so And I'll tell you funny sidebar story to that in a second too We're basically we were like well, let's get tattoos because that's affordable Special and we'll have it a long time And you know we're still a good friends now like we're homies and so I mean, you know, I think of her frequently. She's a great person and like I love that I have a piece of her on my arm But it's also this other thing too You know it's a sketch of a cupcake because I love baking and so So there's a secret in what the shape of this the layout of the sprinkles is but anyways And so To the ring thing though Eventually what happened was as we were engaged for only like nine months or so but She started getting the look which is when you tell someone you're engaged as a woman Bam, they look right at your left hand. Is that messed up and now you got to explain it every time to people that may not be of the mind of I'd not get in a ring and That became tiresome so she went and got to keep it to Konia just so she didn't have to explain it to people Yeah, and I'm like respect. I can respect that because we are practical way to get around just not having to And you're the first thing that people say is private. Oh, is he cheap? Right, so he didn't want to buy your ring. He talked you out of a ring. Of course you want to ring right and the out and and Pro tip ladies cheaper posed to me She's that I mean, she's that kind of woman. She's like this is what I want I'm gonna go get it. Yeah, he said yes. Yeah, he said yes. I mean and then later we both like No, it's not working out now. You want to do quick questions. Yeah quick questions Is a segment where I ask quick questions You don't have to give quick answers, but question number one What's the simplest advice that's hardest to follow? I think being yourself Be yourself that's that's a tough at times. I think it gets much easier as you're more aware of it and practice it But like mentioning the other one of your podcasts I was listening to with Jacob on the way over here That we have these roles and these rituals that we play into like when you're around family versus friends versus You know awareness helps Balance all that out. I think but it's it's it's tough at times like but I'm You know sometimes it means like while I'm the black dude or I'm I'm the dreads dude or you know and I mean I'm the design dude. You know what I mean I'm the minimalist dude. Yeah, you know and just you know thinking about the fullness of your personality And and and being okay with that that like there are lots of facets to me It took me a minute to be okay with the baking and the design and that these were related But I did not understand them as that what's the most inspirational sentence that you could think of? This is a quote from I don't think it's from William McDonough I think it's someone else's quote, but I heard him say it You don't have to be the best just do it only you can do What's the first thing you do when you wake up in the morning? I snuggle the dog Who is real close by That's right the first thing is I spent much I spent time in my dog Leo because a lot of times during the day I feel badly that I'm so stuck in my computer He's just over there like laying with this sweet little heart of gold and I feel like I have sometimes I'm kind of ignoring him But I'm also like what gratitude young man I could be in an office It's very easy for your first thing to do when you wake up is check email. Yeah, I think that's the worst thing You gotta do something for yourself. Yeah, do something for yourself try to wake up a little early I often meditate in the morning. That's when I find the most the best time to do 10 15 20 minutes So one of those two things. I'm spending time with the dog around meditating What's one skill that you've leveraged in a way that others haven't I think I believe in my ideas? In a way that can bring value to something in a way that like people in that organization would never have thought of What's the one meal that you eat the most The most Probably sides come cookies There's I mean, I make this every almost every day after a yoga I drink a smoothie which is almost based like chocolate milk at this point, but it's like it's like ice almond milk Vega one protein powder love the chocolate and I put the two tablespoons of sunflower butter in there and put it my little magic bullet Baby blender thing It's like drinking chocolate milk because I recall love it. I drink every day. I pretty much have one of those Yeah, I do the I got the Vitamix. So what I'll do is like batch. I'll make. Oh, not green smoothies So and I have those you know the shaker bottles for working out. Yeah, so I just take like the little shaker thing outside of it And then I'll make three at once Okay, and then it'll last with usually two days like three days is if he yeah, I got one in the fridge right now That's on the like the fourth day. I'm like I'll smell it. I've got a smell test later and see if it's worth drinking, but yeah, some of the things I feel like are the best and easiest way to get those nutrients in your body.
