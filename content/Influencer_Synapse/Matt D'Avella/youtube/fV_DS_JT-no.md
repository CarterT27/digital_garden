Do you believe in the impossible?

Ever since I started my podcast I knew there was one story I wanted to tell above all the others. There’s one person that has the ultimate ground up story. One person that has come from nothing and yet created so much. He’s a man that continues to give back and shows what’s possible with the right attitude. His name? Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson.

But there’s a problem:  The Rock is an international super-star & probably the busiest person on the planet. Me? I’m just a guy with a podcast that no one listens to. How the hell am I going to achieve this oddly specific dream?

That’s where you come in. I’ve created a website with a huge tweet button that auto-generates new messages for The Rock. I believe with the right energy, the right message, we can inspire The Rock to come on my podcast. And if we can do that… we I think we can inspire the world.

## Transcript
 He's the Rock, International Superstar, 8-time WWE Champion, and one of the world's most influential humans. I'm Matt, and I have a podcast. He's the People's Champion, New York Times best-selling author, and the most electrifying man in all of entertainment. I'm not. Which makes what I'm attempting to do nearly impossible, oddly specific, and almost certainly incredibly stupid. I want to get the rock on my podcast. My podcast is called The Ground Up Show, and I talk with guests about their journey of starting something from nothing, and the rock has the ultimate ground up story. This is a guy that started out with $7 to his name, rose to the top, and to this day he still continues to put in the work. I want to sit down with him on my podcast to talk about his journey and what drives him. The problem? I barely have any listeners. The rock is the busiest person on the planet, and he has no idea that I exist. But you can change that. Go to get the rock on Matt's podcast.com, and use the big button on the website to tweet the rock a message. With your help, I think we can rock the world.
