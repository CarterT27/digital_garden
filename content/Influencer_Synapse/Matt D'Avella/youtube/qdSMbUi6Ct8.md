## Transcript
 Hey everyone and welcome back to the ground up show, I'm your host Matt Diivella and this is a podcast about starting something from nothing. This week I'm joined by Alex Benayan, an entrepreneur and author of The Third Door, the Wild Quest to uncover how the world's most successful people launch their careers. On the podcast we talk about overcoming fear that dangers of being overly persistent and what he's learned about finding success. And if there's one thing that I am certain of is that there's no, like you said, exact blueprint to success. Anyone who's trying to sell you that is, you know, to get rich quickscape.

To start things out, let's can you give me an introduction basically, what is it that you've been doing over the past five years, you don't have to go into crazy granular details. I know you've been busy and what's your work life look like these days. So for the past, it's set been almost seven years now. I've been going on a journey tracking down some of the world's most successful people and figuring out when they were just starting how they launched their careers. And the interviews and the stories of the journey are now in the book, the third door which just came out a few months ago and I could be happier about it. In your opinion, does success often lead to happiness? Where does that correlation look? And I imagine it's kind of difficult because a lot of the times you're interviewing these people, you're not really understanding. You can't really tell if somebody's truly happy. Only that people kind of have to find out for themselves, but you can get a good sense that you can get a good sense. Yeah. Like, I don't know, I've been with you for maybe like 20 minutes out. I have a pretty fair sense that your happiness is like above average and there's a short answer in a long answer. The short answer is that, and this is useful for anybody, it doesn't matter what you do for work, there's a big misconception that if I become successful, then I'll be happy and across the board, whether you look at, there's a great happiness scientist named Sean Acre, he's at Harvard, and proven that wrong, or if you just look at anecdotal evidence from stories in the book, every single person has proven that success is only to happiness in many ways, it's actually happiness, it's a success, and there's this great story of one, I interviewed Steve Woznyak, this took place about 70% into the journey. So I'm going to interview Woz and we, you know, I fly up to Cupertino, we're having lunch a Mandarin gourmet, two boxing Apple headquarters, and we're sitting there and this is about 15 minutes before the interview begins, I'm standing outside of the restaurant and I get a phone call from one of my best friends, his name is Ryan, and I tell him what's about to happen, you know, I tell him about to go in every Steve Woznyak, the co-founder of Apple computers and my friend Ryan's like, the Woz really, I'm like, dude, what do you mean? He's like, look, Woz is great, but he peaked like 20 years ago, you know, look at the Forbes list, Steve Jobs was at the top, Woz was an even on it, and you know, before I could respond, I asked my friend Ryan, you know, why he had such a strong reaction and Ryan goes, do you know what? Maybe it's good your interviewing Woz, try to find out why he wasn't as successful as Steve Jobs, and, you know, before I could think of an answer, I look up and I see Woznyak is walking right toward me, so, you know, I hang up with my friend, I, you know, give Woz a big hug and we go into this restaurant and it's, you know, this big sea of white tablecloths, and, you know, we sit down on the table and I reach for the menu and Woznyak emotions, we put it down and he, you know, calls over the waiter and orders for the both of us, so we have, you know, egg rolls and honey walnut shrimp and chow mane and orange chicken, you know, the tables are overflowing, and within 10 minutes, it's undeniable that Steve Woznyak is the happiest person I've ever met. You know, it doesn't matter if you talk about his dogs or his cars or his wife, everything he talks about, he has this exuberant joy, so, kind of become curious and I, you know, ask him what it was like first meeting Steve Jobs and he told me they actually met a couple of miles from where we were sitting and they bonded, not over tech, but they bonded over pranks and I fucking love pranks, so, you know, Woznyak just told me all these pranks and I'm crying from laughter in about 30 minutes later, this woman shows up at the table once it's down and Woznyak introduces me to his wife, Janet, and Woz explains to her about the book and what I'm doing and that I'm interviewing some of the most successful people and then Woz turns to me and Woz is voice and goes, you know, I don't know why you're interviewing me, I'm not a big mogul like Steve Jobs or anything like that, and his voice trailed as if he was baiting me for a response and I did the only thing I could think of, I stuffed an egg roll in my mouth, you know, so I had to like this big egg roll in my mouth, so Woznyak continues talking and he goes on to explain to me that when he was young, he realized that it was so idiotic to just follow the Western society he's prescription of success and he told himself when he was young, you know, Woz would I truly want to do that would make me happy and he decided that it was two things, one to make things with his bare hands using a generic that changes the world and two to have fun while doing it, so that was his two things to him to find success and I asked him I'm like, is that why you're so happy and he's like, that's exactly right, it's because I get to do what I want every day and his wife's like, oh, he does what he wants every day, trust me, so you know lunch continues and my friend Ryan's question echoes back in my mind and so I asked Woz what it was like when he was starting Apple in the early days and he told me a bunch of stories about him and Steve Jobs and a few stories stood out that really changed my understanding and now the first story took place right before Apple got started Steve Jobs was working at Atari the video game company and Woz was his best friend at the time and Steve Jobs got assigned to make this video game so he asked his best friend Woz who was a much better engineer look I'm getting paid $750 if you make the game I'll split you half of the 750 and Woz goes, dude that is very generous deal and Woz does it in two days even though it's supposed to take two months Jobs turns it in the game is a home run and Jobs gives him half a $750 it came out months later or excuse me it came out decades later that Steve Jobs has never paid $750 he was paid thousands of dollars so that was the first story the second story took place right in the early days of Apple you know it was very obvious Steve Jobs would be the CEO of the company but it wasn't so obvious what Woz and I could be you know where on the executive team he would fit in so Jobs asked him you know you can have any position on the executive team what you want and Woz thought about it and he goes I want my position captain engineer which when you think about his the opposite of silicon valley today right where the higher the salary you have the higher the position the more successful you are and Woz thought about it nothing about dealing with corporate bureaucracy and politics achieved any of the two things that to him were his definition of success so he has to be captain engineer now the final story he told me to me says the most about the kind of person he is this took place right around Apple's IPO you know Jobs and Woz were said to make more money than they ever imagined but right before the IPO some of the earliest Apple employees went to Wozniac and said look we know this is really awkward to bring up but Steve Jobs won't give us any stock options and we don't know what to do and Wozniac goes look that must be a misunderstanding you guys helped build the company let me talk to Steve I'll get this sorted out so Woz goes and talks to Steve Jobs and Jobs goes 0% chance and stamps it are. Wozniac did the only thing he could think of he gave some of his personal shares to these early employees because to him they were like family and on the day of the IPO they all became millionaires and you know I'm sitting at this Chinese restaurant with Wozniac he's leaning back in his chair and laughing it's smiling you know cracking open a fortune cookie and again the question my friend Ryan asked me pops into my head and the only thing I think is who's to say Steve Jobs is more successful is there a problem with how most of us define success because at a growing up it seems like this version of success is kind of thrown onto us you know we could blame culture society or family friends there's a lot of different influences but at the end of the day a lot of us see success as having the material things having all the stuff the house the cars and I was no different it took me being able to see an alternate path being able to see somebody like Wozniac to be able to realize oh that that's I'll do that do you think that it are the version that that many of us uses our default version of success is unhealthy you know it doesn't matter if it's family or society at large the strongest rules that have the strongest grip on us are the ones that are never explicitly said so it's not like your parents that you dad and they're like you know successes fancy cars and lots of money you know no one actually says that but it's the rules that are never explicitly said that have the strongest grip on us and nowhere in my childhood you know I grew up the son of Persian Jewish immigrants and it was communicated very clearly but implicitly that success was you know getting a master's degree of some point becoming a professional doctor a lawyer and you know material wealth and having a family with three or four kids and a nice big house and that was success and you know I don't actually you know when I first was going on this journey I was very angry that like you know I was raised with this wrong notions of success and you know I actually with hindsight can see that my parents my grandparents were just trying to help me not suffer the way they suffer you know my family fled to America's refugees this actually this week is the 40 year anniversary uh one my mom came to America I think she was about 11 years old when she got here and you have to understand I'm this you know I'm the son of Jewish refugees so I pretty much came out of the womb my mom created all me in her arms and then she stamped MD on my ass and something on my way that was my childhood I grew up you know checking the boxes I went to you know premed summer camp I studied for this A.T. to call the biology classes and that in many ways informed really the origin of how this whole journey got started for you when when you're thinking about like success and and shifting it how have others done that on this journey in what ways could we give advice for people who are looking to say not make those mistakes firsthand a lot of you know what I mean there's something to be said at the whole point of the book to not make the mistakes firsthand right like there's something to be said of like touching the stove but I don't think any of us want those scars that will last a lifetime so when you don't have mentors when you don't have this book sometimes you have to learn the mistakes firsthand but I guess what advice would we give people that are just starting out on that journey that are trying not to make the same mistakes that many others have. Yeah there's this great quote that I absolutely love it's a I believe it's a Chinese proverb that said one generation's hindsight can be another's foresight and that's really at the soul of this mission where I just believe that if all these people come together you know not for press not to promote anything but really just to share their best wisdom with an ex-generation people can do so much more and that's sort of been like the rallying cry for me personally and you know I've learned when I had started this book I thought it was just for like me and my friends you know that was the initial origin but I've realized this is about a stage in life not about an age this is for you know anybody who's trying to break through facing rejection you know how did people when they weren't getting their phone calls answered couldn't get a meeting how did they find a way to break through and to me if we want to make it really practical let's say someone out there right now is you know whether they're just coming out of college or they're 50 years old and wanting to switch industries and they want to find that passion here's something really practical they can do you're ready so I call this the 30-day challenge and this is how works this is for anybody who's trying to find their passion trying to find something that you know lights them up it makes them jump out of bed so this how works you you know go to a CVS or some pharmacy and get a you know small spiral notebook and it's important to get a brand new one for like a dollar and right 30-day challenge on the cover and then for the next 30 days in a row journal on these three questions and it's super important that you do this at the same time every day for the next 30 days or either pick the morning pick the night and it's not 30 days spread out over six months it's 30 days consecutive and these are the three questions number one what fills me with enthusiasm today you know what filled me with enthusiasm today number two what drained me of energy today what drained me of energy today and number three what did I learn about myself today now this might sound like super simple and basic but what's shocking is you know the first five days you do it it might be fun every single person who I've talked to who has done it and you know now there's been hundreds of not thousands of people who have done this exercise by day 12 it starts seeming really stupid like you're like I don't understand the point of this it's going nowhere there's always this like little you know slump and then by day like 27 you're like oh I'm starting to see what the point of this wasn't by day like 28 and 29 and 30 you can finally start seeing the fruit so you sort of just have to keep pushing through it and just trust by day 29 and 30 you're going to start being able to see the patterns and the patterns are really powerful because that's the neon signs showing you what your path is I love that advice because I think a lot of times all it takes is getting our thoughts down and putting it in paper and making it real because a lot of times we don't realize what's going on behind the scenes what we're thinking in our heads every day all the time and a lot of times discontent can creep up on you 100% so one of the one of the reasons why I was most excited to have you on this podcast is because I think I could get some personal advice from you so you've had Bill Gates lady Gaga wasn't so many people dozens of amazing successful people that are household names I'm trying to get my own household name on my podcast you already saw the photo so doing the rock Johnson is my guiding light for the past year and a half I've been trying to get him on the podcast and it's been challenging so obviously it's very hard I think just a big one person and say that's the the only person that I want to get on but I feel like in having this laser focus it may eventually work out there's a lot that I've done so far I've built a website get the rock on matspodcast.com lots of videos I've gotten two tweets from him what do they say so the a couple were just like it was basically me posting photos of him one photo of this photo on the wall if that's not too meta and he I said the rock hasn't returned my phone calls yet but I'm not giving up and then I put a link to the website and then he replied you know I haven't returned your phone calls because you've been calling me collect you asshole so I've started to break through slowly but the advice that I want from you and actually I do have to now that I've mentioned it on the podcast I didn't have it cut up but I had to held a jingle competition okay so every time I mentioned the rock on the podcast I have to play the jingle so this is a let's hear so that was the winner Sam Tier from the UK yeah yeah yeah so as you could see this is this is a journey this is a process yeah and and I'm looking for advice for myself but really I think we can also maybe give other people advice who are looking to get that big interview their dream interview what steps do we take to get there you know doesn't matter if you're trying to you know get someone on your podcast or if you're trying to you know meet someone who could hire you for your dream job the steps are actually the exact same and I'll give you I'll give you something very practical and then I'll give you you know a bigger picture story we'll start with a practical the biggest thing that I learned you know one of the people I interviewed for the book is Tim Ferriss you know the author the four work week and the way I got that interview is I hit in a bathroom I was 18 I had to hide in a bathroom for 30 minutes crouched behind a toilet waiting for no one buying a jumpout is a big disaster the end of getting the interview and one thing that I learned about Tim Ferriss my research is that he in many ways launched his career through cold emailing he got his first job by cold emailing the CEO of a startup he wanted to work for 30 times he when he decided he didn't want to work for the startup anymore and become an author he called email the biggest best selling authors and asked for advice so when I was interviewing him I you know it was really pressing him on this cold email advice and he finally shared with me his secret cold emailing template when he's emailing VIPs or CEOs and it goes like this and this goes for anybody out there you will be shocked how well this works but I just have to warn you this isn't cooking or you can just you know remix it to your own style it's like baking or you have to follow it to a tee I've learned by my own mistakes that when I try to like sauce it up myself it doesn't work you have to follow it to a tee and readers of the book my favorite thing is like going and reading the Amazon reviews and people go in all the cold email template works like I live in the biggest shock to them and it's so happy so this is how it goes right yeah so let's say I'm emailing let's have emailing the rocks assistant and his name is Jake um I would go you know dear Jake I know you're really busy and you get a lot of emails so this will only take 60 seconds to read boom that's the first paragraph that one sentence next paragraph is one to two sentences max of who you are and what context you have that's relevant to that person so it's not your whole bio it's really pulling out the one two sentences in your bio that's relevant to the person boom next paragraph one to two sentences max again of your hyper specific question for that person you know the fastest way to get your email and I'm sure you know this your email archived or deleted is saying I would love to grab coffee you know with a stranger just doesn't really work pick your brain right I love to pick your brain I love your advice on something if you can give me a call you know if you give us hyper specific question only then will someone open up and want to start a conversation right so that's that paragraph and the final paragraph is the clincher you go I totally understand if you're too busy to respond even a one or two line reply will completely make my day all the best tip and it's been shocking that I've got an interviews for the book using the cold email template I've met mentors that have changed my life and readers of the book have you know reached out to Cheryl Sandberg and Malcolm Gladwell and it's really been remarkable so that's a really specific thing I think yeah sorry not to cut you off but I think what's also great about it is that your awesome likely somebody will read that email and it might be the very likely might be the person that you're trying to get to and just because they're going to say no this time doesn't mean that a year down the road they might change their mind so if you email them in a way that's unprofessional or is distasteful and you know it doesn't take very long for somebody to be like to see that person again in an inbox they may remember that person or maybe they just do a search in their inbox and see that you wrote the hiding sign mail three years ago or two years ago I think it's like just being respectful with that person and being the kind of person that understands that person situation yeah I couldn't agree more now a bigger picture lesson actually comes straight from Steven Spielberg so when most people don't know is that Spielberg launched his career when he was right about 19 years old he called rejected from film school not once but twice so most people normally when they were rejected from film school twice might think you know maybe this isn't meant for me but he decided to take his education to his own hands he went to community college right here in LA and he ditched class went to Universal Studios theme park went on the tram ride wrote around the lot jumped off the tram hidden a bathroom waited for the tram to drive away and he started walking around the lot so you know he's wandering on this lot and he bumps into an older man who asks him you know what are you doing here and Spielberg tells him the truth you know he's 19 years old his biggest dream is to be a director and he jumped off the tram to walk around and the older man his name was Chuck Silvers and he was the head of the Universal Television Library and Chuck Silvers and Spielberg end up talking for an hour and at the end of the hour Chuck Silvers goes how would you like to come back on to the lawn and Spielberg goes how would be a dream so Chuck Silvers writes a three-day pass Spielberg comes back the first day and the second day the third day then on the fourth day he shows back up you know in a suit carrying his dad's briefcase walks right up to the security gate waves to the garden goes hey Scotty and the guard just waves back it's Spielberg walks right in and you know he's doing this for months he's sneaking on editing bays you know he's sneaking on to sound stages and he's soaking up all the information he can he's asking directors and actors out to lunch and after months of doing this Chuck Silvers slowly becomes Spielberg's mentor and he gave him some great advice Chuck Silvers down and said look there comes a time in your life you're going to have to stop schmoozing and go make something in fact a value to show people in Spielberg took that advice to heart and decided to go spend months directing and editing a short film called and he comes back to Chuck Silvers and shows him this short film and it was so good that a single tear drop came down his face and Chuck Silvers reached for the phone and called the vice president of production of Universal Television Sid Shineberg and he goes said I got something you got to see and Sid Shineberg's like look there's a lot of things people say I have to see like you know this you're working the moral right and Chuck Silver goes no it's that important if you don't watch this somebody else will and Sid Shineberg goes you think it's that god damn important it's Silver's like yes it's that god damn important and sure enough that night the VP watched it in the next morning call Spielberg told him to come to his office and on the table was a contract making him the youngest director and Hollywood history now when you zoom out on that story some people might just say you know Spielberg played the people game you know he now worked around the lot and to me that really doesn't do justice to what happened there I sort of see it as the Spielberg game you know step one you know jump off the tram step two find your inside man step three use that inside man as your way in and the key to that to me is really that inside man if it wasn't for Chuck Silvers one writing Spielberg the three day pass two giving him that inside into how the system works and three putting his reputation on the line when he called the vice president of production not in this sort of happening and of course you know Spielberg was undeniably talented but so are a lot of young directors out there the difference to me is that inside man and when I think of your story with the rock I think the thing that's missing right now you know clearly you have the website you already have like some touch points but it's finding that inside man you know someone in the rocks inner circle of you know five people that the rock really listens to and having that person say trust me that if you're going to do one podcast this here it's this one and I think the hardest thing is how do you approach those kinds of relationships because my greatest fear would be that somebody would think that I'm just using them to get somebody else so how do you approach somebody that's in the inner circle do you I imagine you have to straight up come out with your intent I mean because Spielberg specifically it wasn't at least in that scenario I imagine he didn't see the end goal if I'm going to make a film and then it was just like built the relationship first and then the inside man helped bring him inside if you have a specific scenario where you're trying to get an interview how do you approach that relationship well you know I think with Spielberg and with this is actually very similar where you're very honest about your intention you know important part of the Spielberg story was when Chuck Silver stopped him on the awesome what are you doing here Spielberg's in the truth 19 I jumped off this tram and my biggest dream is to be a director and Chuck Silver just got it I got you and right so he wasn't at that point he wasn't pretending to be right he wasn't like oh you know I just got lost um do I know if I shadow you a little no Spielberg said the truth you know I sort of broke the rules I I wanted around because this is my biggest dream and you know let's say you find the person who might be in the rocks in our circle and you have a friend who might introduce you that person then Chuck has to be really clear which is you know your biggest dream is to interview the rock you know you know how hard that is and how rare that is and you would still love to meet this person either way I get to know and that way the relationship is still organic but the person knows that it's not that you have an ulterior motive you actually have a really profound and authentic intention would you suggest that most people say if they have a podcast or they're trying to interview people and they're finding a new job is to not pick one person that you want and I know obviously this is like a rare weird exception and there are many of those exceptions but for most people who are just saying trying to have a successful blog and they want to interview people for it would be best to not be so specific and to say you know what like I've got a list I've got these 20 people that I would really want to interview because I imagine for as many amazing people that you interviewed there were a lot to said no okay do you want the technically correct answer or the emotionally correct answer you can give both of you the technically correct answer to that question and it's a really important question is that you always need a pipeline because what's going to happen if you're trying to reach out to anybody whether you're trying to reach out to someone you want to interview or whether you're trying to reach out to you know someone you want to get a job from you're going to get bullshit nose you know you're going to you know let's say email a CEO of a startup that you want to work for and the person's going to be like oh you know we're not hiring and then you're going to see next week they hired someone you know it's just a bullshit no because people are human beings and they're afraid of confrontation they don't like to say the truth it's just a very sad part of human behavior but if you have authority people in your pipeline it doesn't matter if you get a bullshit know from one person because you now have 29 other people you can still work on and then you don't have to harass that one person they gave you a bullshit no even though that might be where you want to do and just bank on the door hundred times you can work on everyone else and then maybe a year later go back to them and that door still open it's not the throw you off yeah you're trying to thought but how often can you bet pound on somebody's door because I think that's one really difficult thing is that like you know you get and I get like maybe eight ten emails from the same influencer networks that are trying to sign me as a partner and I'm like I don't even say no just because I get them so often but the repetitions not going to help it's not going to work dude I learned this lesson the hard way um when I was trying to interview Tim Ferriss in addition of crouching the bathroom I also emailed his assistant thirty two times um you didn't make Tim very happy and sadly I was so young I couldn't learn my lesson at that point because I made the same mistake again with Warren Buffett now this is one of the biggest mistakes I made on this whole seven year journey I you know Warren Buffett was the person who I sort of set my eyes on and I thought look if anyone's going to say yes to an interview it had to be Warren Buffett he loves college students he loves helping young people so I made that my number one thing he was my rock you know and for the next eight months I didn't work on anyone else but Warren Buffett and that was the biggest mistake of my life hmm I would wake up at you know four o'clock in the morning put on my running shoes put on you know the rocky theme song in my earbuds and I would sprint down the sidewalk pretending Warren Buffett was at the end you know as that deranged try to get to him right I would wake up read Warren Buffett biographies I would you know draft letters to him in every week I would send him a new letter and every Wednesday I would call his assistant and you know after three months of being rejected it really hurts by month six you know you're coughing up blood and you know I'm 20 years old at the time too so my sense of identity is completely attached to this project and this mission and by month eight you know completely rejected and what ended up happening is actually ended up hacking Warren Buffett sureholders me to which is a whole story and it of itself but the important part is that after that I actually finally got the interview with Bill Gates completely separately and the interview with Bill Gates went so well that at the end Gates is off the set let us know how we can help and I'm like well you know it's about with Warren Buffett and they're like oh that's an easy one you know Bill and Warren are best friends so I get an email from Bill Gates's office a couple weeks later saying please no more messages to Warren's office thanks and I'll never know exactly what happened but I assume I want something like oh we know all about Alex you know this is not happening you know I've been calling their office every week for eight months and what that taught me is that not only was the answer so no from Buffett's office I had pounded on the door so many times I got myself blacklisted and every business book talks about the value of persistence but no business book warns you about the dangers of over persistence where you can pound on a door so many times that instead of knocking it down they call the police on you and I had dug myself into such a deep hole that even Bill Gates couldn't pull me out and no one talks about that that's crazy look not the most fun part of this story but yeah one of those hot stove memories that for sure where you learned it the hard way and it's unfortunate that I mean who knows time will always can always turn things around so yeah yeah did you have the I know we were I kind of sidetracked you a little bit but did you was at the emotional response you were talking about in a big way you know the technical response you know is have the pipeline that's the answer you definitely need to have a pipeline it doesn't matter what you're working on now emotionally and this is where I differ with a lot of other people I actually think it's amazing that you have the rock as your holy grail interview because to me in many ways Bill Gates I talked about Buffett and many ways Bill Gates is my ultimate mountain top interview and and hindsight I can see that if I didn't have that so many good things happen on my way to get to Bill Gates and so many disastrous things happen the Tommy incredible lessons and if it wasn't for that holy grail of trying to reach Bill Gates none of those other things would happen so I think you actually having this laser focus on the rock is going to take you on a really cool journey that's going to take you exactly where you need to be and whether that's sitting with a rock or not it actually is the point what was that like for you but you're still with the rock yeah yeah yeah I mean it's it's kind of you know you talk about wasniac's definition of success and for me I wouldn't put getting the rock on my podcast as in my version of success because I don't think that you should really hinge your success or happiness on things that you can't control that said it is the biggest and craziest goal that I have and I think it's I think we all should have fun crazy goals that we chase after and that are possible yeah you know it's not 100% far fetch he lives right here in LA yeah he does interviews all the time for movies it's not far fetch yeah so when you just haven't given him an offer that he can refuse yet I know well that's the thought yeah who knows if you actually could because there's I mean somebody like so I'm I'm actually curious about you approaching that Bill Gates interview like this is your rock moment how nervous are you how do you prepare for an interview that's that big that you maybe don't get a second chance to oh yeah you almost certainly will not get a second chance to write so I have a method with my interviews where I really like I spend at the bare minimum weeks but normally months reading everything I can about the person now these are the big interviews for the book I've adapted it over the years but for the big Bill Gates like interviews I'll read everything I can because if you're sitting down with the person of that caliber who's done thousands of interviews in their life you don't want to waste their time and you want to make sure the questions you're asking are questions that you're not easily just going to read about his biography in many ways you almost want to write down the questions you have for him originally read all of his biography is watch all of his interviews over course of multiple months I then write the follow-up questions so by the time you sit down with him it's almost as if it's your eighth interview with him because you're using all the information out there ready to answer your first seven rounds of questions and that's what makes for a great interview right I guess if you already have the answers to the questions why ask them to begin with right right if you're asking you know now there's a rare exception of sometimes I like to ask a question or two in the beginning to set the mood yeah but if you that's only if you have that luxury yeah and I think even like what we were talking about before the podcast is a lot of people focus a little bit too much on getting information out of somebody versus actually having an enjoyable conversation and you know I think we have to sometimes let go of the expectations that every interview you have is going to be this life changing transformative experience for your audience or for yourself and it's just enjoy yourself let go and actually have a conversation with somebody I agree 100% one of the people I interviewed for the book was Larry King you know undeniably one of the greatest interviewers in history and Larry King gave me his you know biggest interview advice and he said the biggest mistake young interviewers make is they look at the interviewers they admire whether it's Oprah or Bopper Walters or Larry King and they try to copy their styles and he said that's the biggest mistake you can make because you're not asking yourself why we have those styles and you know Oprah has all this emotion and Barbara Walters has all these strategic questions and Larry likes to ask you know the simple direct questions and Larry said you're not understanding why we have those styles the reason we have those styles is because that's what makes us the most comfortable in our seats and when we're comfortable the guest is comfortable and that's what makes for the best interview so how did that the bill gates one roll out were you your most comfortable no I got no no no of course not I had to touch the stove myself yeah I had to touch the stove myself what happened though is that at the end of the bill gates interview you know and I got tremendous lessons out of it I learned his negotiating secrets his sales secrets but it wasn't till the very end of the interview where you know bill gates sheep saps like you have one minute left and I'm like oh fuck you know I look at my no pet and they're still like all these unass questions and I ask myself you know you have one minute of bill gates just have some fun with it and I threw my question to the side and I just looked at them and I was like and I still remember if I close my eyes I can remember you know sitting it was this you know ivory gray couch and I'm sitting on the right end of the couch bill is on a armchair to my right you know I'm 20 at the time this is like a one of the biggest life moments for me and I spent two years trying to get to this point and I look at them and I'm just like what was one of the most fun funny hustle stories from early on engage just you know sits back in his chair and his eyes lift up and he starts to smile and it looks as if he's like watching a movie and his mind's eye and he starts laughing just to himself and he starts telling me this hilarious story when he was just starting out and traveling in Japan selling Microsoft software in Japan and I'm now cracking up the chief of staff is cracking up and it's as if all the tension of the past hour had shattered and this was no longer an interview just a couple people having a good time and bill now started telling me all these other stories that I didn't even know to ask about it I could feel this warmth spreading throughout the room and you know the interview wrapped up and we shook hands and he said goodbye and I remember looking over my shoulder like getting this one final glimpse and wishing I had started the interview like that to begin with what a lesson yeah so for a lot of people that listen to this podcast I try to help people who are just getting started out on their journey so when you're you're at the very beginning you have an idea of how you're going to be able to make it you know we we love to give advice I got the in college to create a business plan five year business plan and follow these certain steps to get there and from what you've learned this idea of the third door there aren't just two options for making it I love it if you just talked a little bit about what the conclusion you came to after interviewing all these people you know when I had started the journey I was 18 years old a freshman in college and there was no part of me that was searching for that you know one key to success because I've seen all the TED talks I read all those business books and anyone who talked about the one key to success I would normally just roll my eyes you know and I'm sure you've seen all those videos and when I had set up on the journey what happened though is over the seven years I don't know if you're a big music fan but it was almost like there was a common melody in every single interview I did and it doesn't matter if it was my angeloo for poetry or Jane Goodall for science or you know Quincy Jones every single person who I interviewed treated life and business and success the exact same way and the analogy that came to me because I was 21 of the time was that you know it's sort of like getting into a nightclub there's always three ways in there's the first door the main entrance where the line curves around the block where 99% of people wait around hoping to get it you know that's the first door you know you're standing in line holding your resume hoping the bouncer let's you through that's the first door and then there's the second door the VIP entrance where billionaires and celebrities go through and for some reason school and society have this way of making us feel like those the only two ways in you either wait your turn or you're born into it but what I've learned is that there's always always the third door and it's the entrance where you jump out of line and run down the alley bang on the door hundred times crack open the window go through the kitchen there's always a way in and it doesn't matter if that's how billgate solos first piece of software or how lady Gaga got a first record deal they all took the third door so that's not only you know the title of the book and the thesis of the book that's really the energy that I'm trying to inject into the readers and I imagine this third door it's never going to be the same there's no template there's no recipe to follow each person depending on their platform their career whatever it is they're doing that's the hard part because they're going to have to figure it out for themselves 100% you know I spent seven years spending thousands of hours researching going through hundreds of biographies and sitting down with you know dozens and dozens of people was dying to get answers from and if there's one thing that I am certain of is that there's no like you said exact blueprint to success anyone who's trying to sell you that is you know it's a get rich quick scheme but there is undeniably a mindset and the third door is a mindset it's a way of viewing your problems and when you have that third door mindset really what it gives you is a sense of possibility that there's always a way and it doesn't matter if it's cracking over the window going through the kitchen there's always always a way it's something that I'd love to ask you something that I've been talking about more and more on the podcast and and outside of it is this idea of our hustle culture and how we really value and admire the hustle of the grind the work ethic but sometimes it can come at a detriment sometimes we can push ourselves a little bit too far and I imagine most successful people in the world that's something that they have all experienced in finding that line of going a little bit too far how do you think that we can hustle or work hard with more intention you know my this is something I've thought a lot about something really important to me my understanding of all that changed about a year and a half ago when my dad passed away and passed away from paying credit cancer and I actually passed away about like two miles from where we are right now and you know I'll never forget what it was like being in that room and saying can take us final breath you know it's something you'll you never forget and you know I hate when people talk about you know the silver lining of a pair of passing like say actually I really don't believe there's ever silver lining but naturally you do learn things and something that I have learned from my dad passing away and it's not just the day he passed away it was really because he got paying credit cancer it was this 14th month dying process and after he passed it sort of showed me that you know it doesn't matter how hard you worked or how little you worked at the end of the day we all die and we all die many ways the same way and you know you talk about this you know this hustle culture I think there's this and we talked around the beginning this like implicit then implicit messages in our society I think there's this implicit message that if you like out grind someone else if you put in more hours there's like a special award on your deathbed and it sounds funny but I remember like you know literally the week after my dad passed realizing you know my dad I love my dad but he didn't really have a have a job he like sort of worked with my mom and I think a lot of who I am and I saw and doing a lot of reflecting on it is a reflection who he was and you know again there's no reward for working hard on your deathbed there's no punishment for not working hard enough on your deathbed at the end we're all humans and we die the same way and I think many times people who are out trying to out grind and out hustle comes from this original fear and ticked on on the really famous Zen monk talks about original fear being you know when you're born and whether you believe this or not that idea is really interesting when you're born the second you come out of the womb is the first time you ever experience fear and it's the fear of death the second you're born you have the initial burst of fear of death because you were in this womb where everything was taken care of for you you had this in billacle cord you had the embryonic sack you know you were in many ways heaven right everything was taken care of and all of a sudden you come into this room with bright lights you have to start breathing you're you know there's liquid in your throat you're choking you come into this world choking it about to die you know if you actually think about it's pretty interesting I never thought of that you come into the world trying not to die and that's original fear trying not to die and I think in many ways that follows most people their entire life and it wasn't till my dad passed away where I sort of got to realize from myself that I got to face my own original fear my own fear of death and I realized I'm gonna die anyways and I might as well live the way I want because there's no amount of hard work I can do that's gonna prevent me from dying and there's no amount of slacking off though make me die faster so I might as well do it the way I like I imagine there are things in our lives that we have to define as things not worth sacrificing there's certain things where we have to draw the line and sometimes our life gets out of balance sometimes we have busy periods like you said you were just in Ohio this morning like sometimes we we we have to push ourselves a little bit hard when we're promoting a book and we're on tour and we're doing all these things but you need to take a step back and look over the course of the year and say did I sacrifice things that were too important to me did I sacrifice on my values and my principles right you know there's this anecdote you know it's a super famous and I'm sure you probably heard it before of this you know college professor that has you know these buckets of rocks pebbles and sand and you know he has this big jar and he's trying to teach the class about life priorities and he said you know the sand and the pebbles and the rocks are symbols for the things in your life the rocks are the big things in your life you know your family your you know your life mission your health the pebbles are the things that are a little less important the sand is like you know social media and you know what people think give you and you're clothing whatever right and he said let's see how many things we can put into this one jar and first he puts the sand if those are all the way to the top and he's like do we have rooms for pebbles or rocks and everyone's like no jar is already full so yeah I'm decent out again and he starts things like right now let's start if we first put in the big things so he puts in the rocks and now the rocks all the way to the top and then he pours in the pebbles and the pebbles fill in the space and then he pours in the sand and the sand fills of all the space and the lesson is really clear which is that if you fill your day with the things that matter to you most whether to your family your health your work all the other things will fill in the space in between but if you're spending I have a lot of friends who spend it so much of their time on you know trying to optimize their Instagram page and they're not calling back their best friends and you know everyone's on their own path and I don't think anyone's doing it right or wrong I've just learned for myself and especially again after my dad passed that we're gonna die you know my dad died when he was 60 and something I took away from it is my dad left he lived 60 years you know to a lot of people that's young but also 60 years to 60 years but I could see in my dad's eyes how much he felt that he was getting short-changed and I realized it doesn't matter if you're living for 60 years my grandpa's 93 right now and he still feels like he's dying too early so it doesn't matter how long you lived you're always gonna feel like there wasn't enough time so you might as well use that time to the things that you care about most I imagine you want to end your life knowing that you don't have any regrets either and I think typically the things that people end up regretting are those things that they didn't do the businesses they didn't try to start and there is that fear like you said that basic fear that we have from the moment we're born that we're gonna fail that everything's gonna fall apart we're not gonna be able to make it and what does it take to get over those hurdles to get over that initial fear to create the things we want including creating the life that we want you know there's anyone who's out there who's struggling with dealing with fear dealing with insecurities dealing with you know life sort of falling apart in many ways there's one book I recommend above all else the third door that is well but it's a book called one thing is fall apart by Pemachodron and I first started reading the book on my dad got diagnosed with cancer and if there's ever been a book that's completely changed my outlook on light for the better it's that book and if anyone out there is like super nerdy like me you know it was sort of like the software update I needed and I didn't even know I needed and this book helped you realize that fear is a natural part of the human existence and when you try to fight your fear that's when it has the strongest grip of your life but when you accept your fear and invite it in to you know your mental living room allow to sit down on the couch you know maybe you offer it some cookies the fear sort of relaxes it's still there don't got me wrong it doesn't magically disappear but it stops arguing with you and it just sort of sits around and you know happiness comes sits next to it and then joy makes it laugh a little and after a while you'll notice the fear sort of quites down and might just slip out the back door but that only works when you first give a permission to stay when you fight your fear it grows when you give it permission it releases yeah there's certain I imagine a lot of times fear can be a guiding post for us it's a way to realize that we're actually pushing ourselves into territory that's worth pursuing right if everything was easy you know if success was easy then everybody would do it and we wouldn't even be having this podcast but the more you push yourself into those uncomfortable situations that fear the more that it will drop away and the more that you'll find new things to be afraid of yeah I think that's probably something that we should be trying to push ourselves to do every day if you're not feeling fear then you're probably not pursuing a meaningful life you know one of the biggest you know I couldn't agree more and one of the biggest biggest lessons I've learned on this whole journey is really surrounding fear because when I had started out I was completely consumed by fear and it's something most people don't know about me is when I was young I was like the most scared kid you would ever meet I had a night light until I was like 12 years old you know and I'm serious I would go to theme parks with my friends and it would be miserable for them because me debating whether I'm going to go on a roller coaster not was the most annoying debate and history when I started working on the book when I was 18 I was completely consumed by fear so naturally one of my biggest questions was how did all these other people who achieved these monumental things relate to their fear I just assumed Bill Gates and I'll Musk had to be fearless or else how would they have done what they did when I started doing my research and I started doing my interviews over and over and over and over and I started to get the same answer which was the last thing I expected not only were these people scared they were completely terrified the whole way through so it wasn't fearlessness they achieved it was courage and while it sounds similar the difference is critical and if there's one thing you know I want to sort of like implant into people's heads it's the small difference because it can change your life you know fearlessness is jumping off of a cliff and not thinking about it you know that's idiotic courage on the other hand is acknowledging your fears analyzing the consequences I then deciding you care so much about it you're still going to take one thoughtful stuff forward anyway you want to wrap up with a couple quick questions yes quick questions quick answers unless you want to be quick okay it's not it's not rapid fire it's quick questions right I love it so if you could go back to version of yourself I know that you dropped out of college but for those that are around that time or maybe they're thinking about dropping out or they're about to graduate college what advice would you give them if they're setting out to pursue something unconventional or guess what yeah also I think another way to phrase it would be like what would you do differently the biggest thing whether you're doing something unconventional or you're contemplating doing something unconventional would be and if I can go back in time and talk to myself you know my 1819 year old self I would remind myself that just because things aren't working out now you know just because you're consumed by fear or you're facing rejection it it doesn't mean you're doing something wrong and I think there's this big misconception that if it doesn't work out right away there's something wrong with a project and it's you know it's the most idiotic idea but it's so prevalent and it was a big thing I was debating constantly in my journey and if I can go back in time I would remind myself it's natural for things not to work out automatically in the beginning build gates would no one knows but you know if you open his biography it's right there he dropped out of Harvard you know took a semester off to start working on Microsoft but then Microsoft didn't take off the way he had hoped so he went back to college didn't know there's a semester of school and that was like all right let me try one more time and he took another semester off worked on Microsoft and then it started to go it never blast off the way you think Mark Zuckerberg in the summer when he was working on Facebook the whole time you know full time when he had 250 thousand users he pulled Sean Parker aside his mentor and said is this thing a fad you know it's never clear when you're in the trenches it's only clear on hindsight and the only person who can decide whether you're going to move forward or stop is you I'm curious obviously you've read tons of biographies in researching for this book but it sounds like it's something that you're really into anyway where there are two or three recommendations that you'd give for people who are interested in learning about some of these individuals which were the the most captivating for you that you picked up and you couldn't put down that's a great question biographies specifically is important yeah because normally I give other kinds of book recommendations yeah I haven't read a biography in a while so this is a selfish question I've definitely read there are some that just kind of really pull you in and it's always fascinating to learn about these people's um the Steve Jobs biography is great just for it's just fascinating period you'll learn the lessons that you're met everyone who I've talked to who's read the Steve Jobs biography has taken away different lessons the lessons I took away other people took away different lessons it's just fascinating because it's written really well yeah and it's just covers one of the most interesting lives out there so the Steve Jobsography I highly recommend by Walter Isaacson anyone who's even remotely interested in finance even if you don't want to go into finance and you just want to understand how someone goes from you know middle class to the second richest person in the United States should read the snowball which is the biography of Warren Buffett there's multiple biographies on Buffett I've read away to any of them the snowball is the one that covers his life the best and a third would be yeah I know why the cage works saying is by my angelow now what people need to understand before reading it I'm sure many people have already read it it's her autobiography but of her early years of when she's I believe from you know five years old to ten years older it covers you know the very beginning of her life her whole autobiography is a multi part series of books I know how the cage works sings though is powerful because it covers a time in her life when she was raped and eight years old and it gives an insight into what it was like being black in America at that time being an eight year old survivor of rape and it's written though from a 40 year old's perspective many times we read biographies or autobiography is where it's you know Richard Branson looking back on his whole life and his you know 70s or whatnot I think there's something really powerful about someone in their you know 40s looking back at when they're eight and having a whole book just on that topic and it's you know gorgeous they read enough horse what's one universal skill that you think all creators should learn or haven't put enough time into oh my god I am so surprised by the first thing that came to my mind and I I'm just gonna go with it which is meditation and the reason I'm surprised by this because skill I was expecting my answer to be you know whether it's storytelling or the reason I think meditation is the first thing that came to my mind is that meditation creates the space for whatever your natural talents and skills are to flourish is that something that you saw with a lot of the people that you interviewed a lot of the people that interviewed to the point where I would say maybe three or four years into my journey look I started meditating look I come from an immigrant family so like meditation and therapy are equivalent to cocaine to my parents you know like it's like these taboo there's like oh god he went to a therapist he must be a drug addict you know so to me you know I'm studying all these successful people I'm talking with all the people who work with and I just started noticing the one that are happiest and the ones that are most relaxed I'll do this weird thing called meditating and to me is I had no interest in meditating at all but I don't know if I was interviewing all the world's most successful people they all told me they took this pill called you know XYZ I'd be like I'll take it for a week let's see what happened I don't know you know if they all said like they all do you know Molly for breakfast I'd be like I'll try it for a week I know the works for buffet and Oprah like let's see what happens and for the record they did not do Molly for the record they did not do Molly but you know after a while you know for Windfree Jerry Seinfeld Ellen DeGeneres Ray Doleo you know they all are talking about this thing called you know meditation transcendental meditation specifically so I'm just like what's the worst that could happen I take a class and I think it's stupid that's the worst case scenario it transformed my life better than anything and I think what's actually sort of interesting is I didn't start meditating for spiritual reasons at all I did it as an almost a business experiment where all these people who do really well in business swear by this thing let me see what would happen and I literally did it as in my mind a business expense paying the whatever the cost was for the meditation class to me was a business expense to just test out one of the things in the book and you know literally I put meditation up there with like learning how to eat healthy and learning how to read like it's in that caliber of life changing things start meditating thank you so much for this book I cannot wait to read it if you if people want the book if people want to
