Do you believe in the impossible?

Ever since I started my podcast I knew there was one story I wanted to tell. There’s one person that has the ultimate ground up story. One person that has come from nothing and yet created so much. He’s a man that continues to give back and shows what’s possible with the right attitude. His name? Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson.

But there’s a problem:  The Rock is an international super-star & probably the busiest person on the planet. Me? I’m just a guy with a podcast that no one listens to. How the hell am I going to achieve this oddly specific dream?

That’s where you come in. I’ve created a website with a huge tweet button that auto-generates new messages for The Rock. I believe with the right energy, the right message, we can inspire The Rock to come on my podcast. And if we can do that… we I think we can inspire the world.

## Transcript
 they say it's impossible they say it can't be done that it's a waste of time that it's silly or stupid they ask why I ask why not they ask how I say I'm not really sure to be honest but today we make the first leap forward that's right when I started this podcast I thought deep about who has the ultimate ground up story who really shows what's possible with the right attitude who has come from so little and yet created so much when I thought about who that person would be it didn't take long for me to think of one man the rock that's right I've had this crazy goal to get the rock on my podcast since the very beginning it might even be the reason why I started this podcast to begin with to be able to sit down and tell this man's story to hopefully inspire the world but before we do that we need to inspire the rock to come on my podcast and I've been talking about this with guests for a very long time and we've been brain storming trying to figure out the best way to capture his attention because his attention is very precious and it's also very difficult to get because this is a guy that has over 50 million Facebook followers he has over 95 million Instagram followers he gets over 10,000 15 sometimes 20,000 comments a day across all of his social media accounts so how do we capture that attention mind you I'm a guy who has 75 followers on his podcast Twitter page so I don't have a lot of ammunition and I don't have a lot of cloud so it's gonna make this one of the most challenging things I've ever attempted to do but that's why I'm asking for your help and that's why today is a really important and a special day because for the first time I'm launching the website it's called get the rock on matt'spodcast.com I've got a hashtag as well it's called get the rock on matt's podcast but if you go to website what I've done is I've created a bunch of videos gifts and a really big tweet button the tweet button auto generates and creates new tweets every time you click on it and it sends directly to the rock the idea here is if we can get enough of us to message the rock to tell the rock why it would be great to come on to Matt's podcast to come on the ground up show then maybe we'll be able to make a dent maybe we'll be able to inspire the rock to come on this show so what I'm asking for you to do right now to make this dream a reality to make it come true pause this podcast unless you're driving of course but pause this podcast go to get the rock on matt'spodcast.com send a little tweet watch the video understand the story a little bit deeper and then when you come back here I've got an AMA episode today so I'm going to be answering questions from my newsletter subscribers problems that they have with with their life and and areas where they're stuck and also some behind the scenes film stuff that people are asking about and behind the scenes podcast stuff so go to get the rock on matt'spodcast.com and then we'll start the show you're listening to the ground up show a podcast that inspires creatives to make meaningful content and pursue their passions. My name is Matt the Evela and I'm a filmmaker best known for the Netflix documentary minimalism and I'm sitting down with creators to talk about their process the lessons they've learned and how to make an impact. All right guys thanks for entertaining me and thank you so much for those of you who are contributing and helping out by tweeting at the rock messaging the rock in any way you can by the way if anybody actually knows the rock if anybody has a personal connection we can do like the five steps of the rock to see if we can find somebody who knows somebody who knows the rock that we can message him and share this website with him that would be hugely helpful but anyway let's let enough of that let's get into the AMA I've got some great questions here these questions are all coming from my newsletter subscribers people who have signed up to get email updates from me so I gave them first access to ask questions about my life but also maybe things that they're struggling with so let's get right into it the first two questions are pretty similar so I kind of stacked them together I'll read them both through Jeff says the biggest area I continuously continuously get stuck in my health. I have started a gym membership and would go daily for months at a time and eventually lose the motivation I also live a busy life being a full-time student full-time musician and a part-time employee as well so finding the time is hard and you have to make money to survive right do you have any advice on maintaining motivation in the end or says I'm going through a stressful time right now and I really need to get good work get a good work at routine and habit so I can concentrate on my real purpose which is music and film I'm working on a film with my brother and your making minimalism series has been a huge help and we appreciate it all right so two questions mostly about how do you keep up the workout routines and how do you develop those habits to live a healthy lifestyle um first I got to say life is is a balancing act and oftentimes we find ourselves out of balance and it takes awareness it takes asking questions and continually coming back to an awareness of are we in balance and I really dedicating enough of my time to exercising and my dedicated enough of my time to my relationships and the work that I'm passionate about and also making money and my finance is because what Jeff said was you have to make money to survive right that is 100% true and when I graduated college with $97,000 in debt bought a brand new car was put into about $117,000 in debt mostly by my own choosing I was really struggling with my finances there was a lot that wasn't going well I was living at home with my parents I wasn't really focusing on my relationships as much and to say that you can be completely in balance is wrong but to say that you can do better at it is definitely true so for me in the beginning it was all right let me just focus on focus on my finances what can I do today to take a step forward in the right direction I actually started out with writing a letter to myself for giving myself for the debt that I was put into or the debt that I put myself into I took responsibility for what I had done and it was the only way for me to really put my head down and start in the right direction and then we got an ambulance in the background but that was a big thing for me and I knew that it wasn't going to be able to change everything right in that moment and I living at home in central New Jersey I wasn't going to be able to focus as much on my relationships I did my best to connect with people online but you know you know I had a couple friends from back home that I would hang out with but other than that I couldn't really develop and create new relationships in my hometown so I was focusing on what can I do today to get out of this how can I chip away at this debt which then will actually help free up more personal time that I can spend on my relationships and then I've really found that if you can find one or two things to change in your life one or two habits to get to stick it can be a domino effect and it can really affect the rest of your life when I started exercising and working out for the first time it was in college and I had a really tough time I was really underweight I was probably 125 130 pounds but I really wanted to gain muscle and I had been trying since I was a teenager since I was 13 years old working out in my my parents basement where I ended up moving back to once I graduated college but just trying to work out trying to put on weight nothing would work nothing would stick and then finally in college there was it just all started to fall into place I started to go to the gym every day I just said I'm going to go to the gym every single day seven days a week whether it's 15 minutes five minutes or an hour I just need to get started and that's one thing I would say is that if you don't have time if you're so busy that you don't have 10 minutes or 15 minutes to exercise and you don't have to go to the gym you could do pushups situps whatever then you're probably a little bit too busy and you can probably cut back on the things that you're focusing on because you need to make money alright so maybe that's something you don't get rid of but maybe it's cutting back on other things in your life and maybe sacrificing temporarily on going out to the bar and drinks on Fridays Saturday night cutting out on some of the social time that way you can focus on this one thing that's really important your health and then once you develop that habit it sticks it actually becomes hard not to go to the gym so that's what I would say is focusing on that one habit that one thing you can get to stick and when I got it to stick it changed everything else in my life because then I started eating healthier I started adding smoothies and protein shakes into my diet and I started to slowly build muscle and build more strength over time but it didn't happen overnight it started really slowly once I developed the habit I was able to keep going forward and I would also say be careful with motivation and inspiration and I made a film called unstuck the five steps to change and a little bit clicked baby in the title but it was really what I had learned about all these people that we interviewed in minimalism and how they were able to get unstuck so when I looked at them a lot of them did use motivation and inspiration but it's not something that sticks long term sometimes it's a moment where you read a book you read a Tony Robbins audio tape or you listen to a song and it really it it kick starts you into this root new routine that you want to develop or this new habit but that's not what's going to take you through the long run so what I suggest is become really clear on the why why are you doing this why is it important to you and if you can continue to keep that in the front of mind if you continue to remind yourself of why you're doing this and why it's important to you then it's going to be much more likely that you're going to stick through and maintain the habit for the long run um next question Pierre my question is how did you learn to improve your energy during the day to maintain a high energy when most of the time you might not so for meetings during work etc so the one thing I think it does come back to the healthy exercise and the healthy habits getting enough sleep incredibly important most people don't get enough sleep in America at least so focusing on on those two pillars is going to be huge to improving your your wellness and your energy levels throughout the day making sure that you're eating I know when I get really busy and talk about balance when I get busy and I'm maybe spending most of my time during work I'm drinking coffee and I'm having a peanut butter sandwich and that's what's getting me through the day for for most of those really intense days which I don't suggest you do I think there's a better way to go about it but to say that you focus on eating healthy throughout the day if I were to you know instead prep a couple smoothies in the beginning of the day that would last me the next two days then I'm getting some more energy some more of the essential vitamins and nutrients that I need to keep myself going that's incredibly important I would say also try to gain control of your schedule so that's one of the reasons why I love being a freelancer why I love running my own business and working for myself not everybody can do that not everybody wants to do that I know so many people that are like man I give you credit but that's not something I would ever want from my life it's just it's something that I really value and one of the benefits like there's a lot of stuff about it that's not glamorous and not fun and I really had to bust my ass in the beginning and work on barmits for videos local TV commercials stuff that's not thrilling and exciting but what I gotta say is once I was able to break through that and there's still stuff that's that's not fun and not exciting that I have to do I gotta do my taxes I gotta do you know work out what insurance provider to get from my business and all these other stuff that's not really exciting but once I was able to break through from from some of those shitty low level not I was a low level but shitty jobs that didn't really fulfill me in the long run and got monotonous and repetitive I still was able to set my own schedule I was able to take the clients I wanted I was able to set the meetings when I want so say like you know if somebody throws a meeting on your schedule for 4 p.m. it's gonna be really tough to keep the energy up all throughout the day and then be sharp on that meeting at 4 o'clock towards the end of the day so now as as an entrepreneur as somebody who runs my own business most of the time I can make suggestions I can say hey can we get on a call at 11 a.m. or can we get on a call at 9 a.m. if it doesn't work then we can do another day earlier in the morning but it's really based on my schedule for the most part you know of course there's going to be some people that are that are hard to get hold of and that I really want to talk to or say maybe a guest say the rock if I want to get him on my podcast and he wants to talk at 7 p.m. at night or 3 a.m. in the morning I'm going to make it work and I'm going to figure out a way for those temporary bursts but for the most part if you take control of your schedule you can really make sure that your energy is spent in a wise way. I also notice that the early mornings is when I have my most energy so that's usually when I do my most important tasks so in leading up to the launch for get the rock on my podcast for the past two to three weeks this has been a really a work in progress and if you guys actually go to the website you'll see how much time I've put into this I did all the design stuff myself I made all the gifts and the videos there were so many assets the website like creating the button and evolving it over time and figuring out what was working what wasn't and you know creating this button my brother helped me to create this auto generation button to tweet the rock around a message all this stuff takes a lot of time and when I start out in the beginning of the day I'm really energized I'm really hyped up and I'm really jazzed up about making this thing happen but then when it comes to four or five p.m. by the way I get up at like five thirty six a.m. so 12 hours into the day you know sometimes I'll take a break for lunch in the middle of the day but I've been working pretty long hours especially when I'm passionate about something because it's something that's really fulfilling to me and I don't really see it as work in the traditional sense so when I'm putting together the stuff I will get really tired by five six p.m. usually a little bit earlier usually I hit a wall in the middle of the day when I go to the gym it actually re-energizes me makes me push a little bit further and a little bit harder but I know I get my best work done from probably six thirty a.m. to nine thirty a.m. 10 a.m. and that's when I'm making these videos that's when I'm putting together my most creative work so if you have a job if you have a nine to five that you are you know dedicated to that you love but you also want to start working on some side projects and you have some passionate ideas that you really want to execute on or you want to write or you want to make a documentary or you want to start getting into graphic design I suggest trying to develop an early morning routine so if you have to be at work by nine like up at five thirty or six put in an hour to on your passion and you know just get started and I think that's the best the best time to do it so the most important things to your life you should try to get them in early in the morning or yell I feel really stuck right now I'm involved in two different associations which ask a lot of my time I also run my own company and I'm the mother of two under four years old I love what I'm doing with both my associates but I also feel completely trapped sometimes I used to add I used to say yes for everything and since I'm automatically the one in charge everyone is resting on me thinking that I'm going to do it without realizing it they put a lot of pressure on me and I feel very stressed and feel very guilty because the time I spend doing these prevents me from doing anything else that I love and spending more time with my kids I have a hard time saying no I'm on the verge of resignation while I love to get involved in these associations how to say no and stick it in when people and stick to it when people are always trying to find reasons for you to bring things do things for them that's a really good question I think it does go back to this idea of perhaps you have too much on your plate right now and perhaps you can cut back and not do as much stuff what I always do for say say new things come in people ask me hey can you know I interview you from my podcast do you want to go out for coffee would love to meet up if it's through an email that's really easy I can have the time to think about it I can I I'm pretty good at saying no because you know in the very beginning of course you have to say yes to everything and I said yes to every project I could I did dozens of wedding videos bar myths for intro videos it didn't really matter as long as like ethically I was okay with it I didn't shoot porn or anything like that but as long as I was ethically okay with it somebody was paying me to make a video I said hell yes let's do it and it worked on a couple of different levels first of all it was making me an income which in the very beginning was tough and it was far and few in between so early on I would get a project that would be $200 $400 to shoot an edit a video if you did the math I probably was making $10 an hour but I was really focusing and working on my craft I was making money but I'm working on my craft and those bar myths for videos I was I talked about it on the episode last week with Josh and Ryan I did like this crazy amount of work and energy put into adding fire on a bat so this like kid was it like it was for his intro video for his bar myths so before he came out and was shown in front of his family and friends as a man they would play this video about him getting hyped up playing basketball and baseball and all that stuff so I literally went after school to one of his games and I filmed him playing baseball and what I did was I added this extra animation afterwards to his bat so like flames would fly out of the bat when he hit the ball and I did it to the the baseball as well when the pitcher was throwing it to the mound it would light up with fire and that probably took me a lot of time I got paid to do it and I think I actually got paid pretty well for that project specifically but I also took it upon myself to go above and beyond because they weren't asking for this extra stuff these bells and whistles but I just I really enjoyed it I thought it was fun to learn something but even if it's a project you're you're not passionate about and you don't love you're not really excited about the end product that you're creating you can still put everything you have into it and you're gonna learn a lot from that experience so forget what the original question oh yeah and then also you can you don't have to say yes to everything you can say no if somebody actually asks you over the phone for something this happens to me a lot or at least when I was doing client work somebody would be on the phone with the client we'd be talking about a project and they said oh so how much is that gonna cost and early on I would make the mistake of saying you know well I guess it would cost somewhere between it would be like 200 to 300 dollars or you know if that's something you can afford so I'd be like uses very soft language and I wouldn't be very confident and how I would say it's gonna cost this much money and especially as I started to push my boundaries I would I at some point you have to go from 200 to 500 dollars for a video at some point you got to go from five to a thousand the thousand to ten thousand you can you know I mean some people might be able to just make that leap right away and go straight to these high paying clients but for most people if you haven't built up the skills yet you're gonna have to start low but making those jumps is really difficult and you're gonna have a lot of self doubt as you try to make those big jumps so for me I couldn't do it over the phone I couldn't say it's gonna cost ten thousand dollars I had to actually say hey so let me you know take the information you just gave me and I'll put together an estimate and I'll break down the cost for you and let you know how much it's gonna cost it actually does a couple things it first make sure that you're naming the right price and you're actually charging what you're worth or you're pushing the edges and trying to you know increase your your rate your your daily rate or whatever it is the second thing that's doing is you're really you're you're validating what the cost of what you're delivering so you're actually saying hey I need some time to think about this I need to actually put it into paper and it's actually you probably should be taking a little bit extra time even if you have a good sense and you can give a range I would also say don't give a range give like three tiers this is like we're getting specific now but give a couple different options for them to choose from usually they'll choose that middle tier but it allows you to add more value and to also increase your revenue so yeah like it gives you some time too like if somebody asks for something over the phone hey can you do this and this let me let me get back to you I'm not really sure I got to look at my schedule it's okay to take time it's also okay to say no once you actually are busy and once you have all these things on your plate it's completely okay to say no David what are your views on alcohol consumption and how do you or others you've interviewed find a balance when it comes to alcohol a couple of my episodes have actually been out you alcohol fueled my podcast episode with my friend Jesse Earl Jordan Lijuin I messed it up on the podcast too and now anytime I say his name I screwed up but Jordan and that episode is called the future he runs a website called Futurism he co-founded it and Jesse Earl my friend I think actually the one with Jacob so cool we actually drank as well and we talked a little bit about that how it kind of loosens you up a little bit obviously it can be used as a crutch which isn't a good thing but those episodes were really fun for me I enjoy alcohol on in moderation certainly when I was in college I drank a lot and I pushed myself a little bit too far and I certainly had nights where I took the alcohol consumption to a point where I got very sick so there's obviously especially when you're young you're just trying to find the limits there and it was just it was a time for me to do that but then now as I've gotten older alcohol affects me in a way different way and that I can't rebound as quickly so one thing that's happened for me is that I actually can't drink beer anymore unfortunately I love beer and I will have a beer from time to time but I would notice that I would just get these raging headaches after drinking one beer sometimes then night of sometimes the morning after so that was really challenging for me because I had to say all right well I got I can't like if I there is a pro and con to drinking this beer it's gonna feel good temporarily but in the long run I'm gonna feel like shit so for the most part now I don't drink beer I'll drink a cider I still don't I don't drink too much anymore I'll have a couple of drinks I rarely get drunk but I do enjoy that it is fun it is for me I can I can still enjoy that in moderation I really enjoy whiskey and scotch and I have a small little collection of five or six bottles that whenever you know I find a new bottle I might grab anything a scotch shit's to me I really enjoy the taste still it comes with a sacrifice there are some people that I've interviewed that do not drink alcohol rich role for instance a couple episodes ago he was actually an alcoholic and battle with that for most of his life after college so he has went through rehab and completely cut out alcohol he can't bring it back into his life so for those people who are suffering with real addictions I haven't seen anybody who's been able to balance a moderation and bring it back in a moderation I can't even comment on that whether that would be a advisable thing to do but something tells me that it really wouldn't but if you can enjoy alcohol on moderation I think it's totally fine I've had many good times drinking alcohol and I would actually love to have every episode over a drink or a glass or most episodes have whiskey and because it tends to give a more relaxed vibe because one of the challenges with doing this podcast I've done about 30 35 interviews so far is that a lot of people I'm talking 90% of the people I'm talking to I have never met and never even had a conversation with it's just I've emailed them and they've said yeah I'd love to come on the podcast and then they come I meet them for the first time at my apartment and at that point I have to kind of first of all I don't want to take up too much of their time they're here for maybe two hours so we we talk a little bit and we you know kind of shoot the shit but then we got to start the podcast and you have to get going with it and you know drinking coffee as comfortable as that might be it adds more of a frenetic energy to it where if people were just sitting down having a drink after you know after a day's work they might feel a little bit more relaxed and a little bit more comfortable talking to a stranger so that's one of the challenges but the thing is that I I can't do that because I can't drink that much alcohol I think that would be a really unhealthy habit to build if I hinge this podcast on drink with that so I choose I chose not to but every once in a while I bring it I'll bring it back in because I think it's fun um Darren has a question about the podcast and the mics I use what type of microphones do you use and what's your podcast that up look like so anybody who listens to the podcast you might not know at this point but I actually film every single episode and I've got a pretty pretty it's a I guess it's complicated from the outside a lot of people when they look at it they get a little bit intimidating intimidated there's some people that I've told or at least I've shown them videos of what I've made and they were just completely surprised to see that there is video that I'm filming each of these episodes they're like I thought this was a podcast so maybe I should be more clear about that but the mics I use are the SM what is it the SM seven bees I've got two of them I got these mics because I saw they were used on Mark Marin and Joe Rogan uses them as well they're kind of the the best of the best in terms of podcasting for for the price I think they do run the mics themselves probably run like $700 or $600 or something like that maybe less but the thing is then you have to have all these extra things and I can show you here like this right here I got a plugs into a cloud because for whatever reason these mics record at a lower volume so I need that to kick up the volume and then that plugs into a zoom H6 audio recorder I can actually lift this up to if it doesn't scrub anything up this is my audio recorder right there it's really great because it's got four XLR inputs so it allows me to interview up to three other people which has recently I did with Josh and Ryan they were the first ever two person podcasts they are the minimalist so I couldn't split them up at least not yet maybe we'll get them individually on to talk about their stories another time but that was that was important to have this kind of device that allowed me to record two people I've got another episode coming up and I think it's next week is really good it's these guys have a company called living on one they have an amazing documentary called living on one dollar and salam neighbor these guys like put themselves into these immersive situations where they went down to I believe it was Brazil for two months and lived on a dollar a day so that was an incredible interview and to have both of them there on the same time was way better and much more of a collaborative discussion than if it was just these one-on-one interviews so I really like it I enjoy it this set up allows me to do that I did buy an extra so I have three of these mics it was tough it was like this is like a lot of money I don't know if I because I'm not making any money doing this podcast this is not you know as you know I don't do advertising on it and so to spend money on it and to know that there is no foreseeable future in which I will make my money back it's kind of tough but for me it's a hobby it's a passion I really love it and I was like you know this is worth the investment for me right now so that's pretty much the audio setup I've got these stands right here too I went from the the tall stands where you kind of pull you can pull it move it around the thing that I don't like about those is that I just always and tinkering and moving it around and if you watch some of the earlier episodes I did I probably move it around every single time I talk I'll bring it towards me and pull it away for no reason at all so I do like these stands that they're very sturdy the other good thing about the stands is that people don't move these around and when I'm filming I'm shooting at a really shallow depth of feel because as you can see if I move back or if I move forward I go out of focus and I'm good at that myself like I can obviously stay put I'm I'm pretty like I know that that's what I'm trying to do but I'm not trying to tell my guest hey make sure you don't move at all because then they're gonna feel uncomfortable going back to like these are strangers that I just met for the first time their new friends I want them to feel comfortable and feel like they can move around but usually I'll tell them you know just if you could stay within an institute from these mics because if you if you hear how I talk once I move further and further away from the mic now I'm about to foot away from the mic doesn't sound good at all so you actually do have to talk really close to these mics for it to make a dent make a difference the yeah so I have three of these podcast mics the video was so I have Sony A7S that's what's recording this one right now and I get an A7R which records that's actually usually used on me because I find that that quality isn't as great as the A7S especially in low light situations I'll have those both set up on manfrodo tri-pods I have two Metabones adapters and I gotta say this has been evolving and changing and it's in the past two episodes actually in the next two episodes that you'll see that I recorded already it's changed quite a bit and there's gonna be much more depth of field on my angle because I got a two Metabones adapters which allows me to use my Canon lenses and I know I'm getting really technical here and I'll get back to some like normal people stuff but I know that a lot of people that listen to this are interested in that and they're also interested in filmmaking and kind of the new degree to details so I've got what is it a 24 millimeter Canon Prime lens that's on me right now that I use I use what about use no I actually don't even use I only use this on this one because it's the wide angle lens and it's just for a one-person on camera type deal I just makes more sense it'd be weird to have a close-up of me doing this solo podcast but what I do is I put the 50 millimeter Prime on for the gas which is beautiful that that image comes out so nice I used to do a wide angle lens but I think that this one is a little bit it just creates such a great depth of field and actually one of the reasons I did it was because of this apartment that I'm in if you like look at this apartment it's pretty bare the my old apartment in Brooklyn was a lot better in terms of the the design and the style and it was I mean it wasn't necessarily a better apartment but I had this room though specifically for podcast filming so I left everything set up it was really dark and moody and I had this nice light underneath of it coming to this apartment everything's bright it's pretty bare I don't have a lot of stuff decorated where my podcast is going to be recorded so I was like all right well I need to up the depth of field and create this really beautiful bokeh around the person's face so you can't see what's in the background and that allows me to shoot this pretty much anywhere so that's what I do for that lens the other one now I usually it's the A7R on me with the Canon 70 to 200 millimeter lens and that lens it's got to be a little bit further away but it creates a pretty nice depth of field on me as well and but they're a little bit tighter and I use two small HD monitors once a 5 inch and one's a 7 inch and these monitors for me they're important and I set them up and so I can view and make sure it's really just for my own well being and my sanity I want to make sure that this podcast is still recording and nothing happened and it shut off because if anybody had listened to the Joe Nation episode that I did a little while back he stopped me halfway through the podcast and said hey by the way I don't know if you want to check your camera but the iris just shut and I looked at it and then the card became corrupt and that was really frustrating and while I don't know with these specific that's never happened before though anybody who's worked in film and technology knows that these things have been all the time and it's just a matter of time before something kicks off or doesn't work in the way you want it to that's why when you're doing a big doc project or something really important or if I get the rock on the podcast I'm probably not going to use these cameras either run out or hire people to help me out with it because there's when you have a professional film camera these cameras aren't necessarily intended for video or at least high stakes videos stuff you want to make sure that it's going to work and then it's not going to fail and some of these cameras have redundancies so you can put two cards in and record on two cards at once so if one gets corrupt if something happens if you drop it and it falls in a puddle of water you still have the ability to use the other card so I have these monitors so I can at least view and make sure for my piece of mind that it's still working and if something happens to go wrong I can adjust and fix it in the moment I was lucky that Joe was a filmmaker as well so he knew that nobody else would have known oh ira shut cameras probably not working so that's okay that and then I have a light I have a C stand here which I'm not going to show it I'm probably going to do behind the scenes video here but at some point and you can check groundupshow.com is where I keep all those updates but I got a C stand and I recently I didn't do always do this but just always kind of experimenting and upping the quality I did it in Brooklyn but it's this paper lantern and it's amazing they cost I think $10 for five of them on Amazon and then I have just a light with a 100 watt daylight bulb and it creates this beautiful soft glow which is really helpful and really nice for doing something like this I wouldn't necessarily bring it on a professional shoot because it doesn't look professional but as in like when you see it but the final product you guys can't see that I'm being lit by this $10 Amazon Prime paper lantern so that's pretty much it so it doesn't sound too complicated but it's definitely about understanding the situation that you're going into understanding the room that you're in and there's so many different every podcast episode it looks a little bit different I wouldn't I don't like that it looks a little bit different and the right I guess the ideal world I would have a podcast studio which we're working on by the way Josh and Ryan from the minimalist we they have a patreon now that they're get raising money to create a podcast and film studio so like that's going to be the ideal scenario where I can look at the space and say all right what camera is what lenses what lighting do we want to bring into this space how can we control it the most because right now we have this I have a big light right here which is natural light coming in which you might think is good and sometimes it can be but when you're doing consistent work and you want everything to look the same you want to be in 100% control of everything all the lights the audio and that's really can only happen if you can you know be in a room where there's no windows or at least you can block out the windows so this works for me right now it works for what I'm doing but of course things will probably change got another question here Chris I guess the big questions I have for you are as follows how do you avoid distraction how do you find your focus when your mind might be thinking about something else how do you work large chunks of work or do you break it down to smaller tasks so question number one how do you avoid distraction I can't say that I always avoid distraction distractions happen that's what they are they're distractions so what I find myself lately sometimes I get distracted on Twitter or Instagram like anybody Facebook I have the you know that that instinct once you open up your browser and I go fake and then I just press enter and then I go into the browser I pay Twitter and then I press enter and then automatically goes to these things and I check my notifications and I look to see what other people are up to and what other people are doing so I'm not great at it and I definitely it's back to that balance sometimes I'm doing really great at cutting that out and sometimes I'm not doing a good job at all but something that I do on my phone specifically I've got my phone here I mean one thing I cut off all notifications the only notifications I get on my phone are through text messages and here's like one of my phone looks like I think sometimes I even only just keep a couple icons on the home page but now I've got to kind of fill it up but it's just two pages there and then at the top left it's like the furthest away I've actually put it into a folder it's called twice a day and I allow myself to check these Twitter Instagram Mailchimp like I would delete them and at points I have deleted Facebook for my phone and deleted all this stuff for my phone email especially but lately I've found myself in need of these things because if I'm posting something I got to post a Twitter an Instagram a lot of what I do now is just promoting my stuff through social media so I kind of need that stuff but the twice it's anything is like that's like wishful thinking because I did it for the first couple days and then I just I just kind of fell off the wagon and I'll check it more often than not but it the hide-um maybe I'll move it to the second screen move it to the third screen even just kind of get it out of sight and also just switch up those icons every once in a while because then you you find yourself going into these just habits and that kind of kills the habit a lot of times I'll leave the house without my phone I'll go to the grocery store and you'll start to notice how much this great guy Anthony's got a website called breakthe twitch.com had a pleasure connecting with him a couple months ago he's a really good guy he's got some amazing content on minimalism and he talks about the twitch and so say you go to the grocery store by yourself and you're you know you're waiting at the Delhi counter the first thing you do is you just go for your phone to pull it out or you're waiting in line there's a line to for the checkout the first thing you do is you have that twitch to go for your phone it's nice when your phone is not there because then it actually breaks the twitch and then you're able to actually realize oh okay now I can be a little bit more mindful I'm not like a chimp running on a or a hamster running on a wheel those things I find to be very helpful in terms of of just being more mindful and asking their right questions and avoiding distractions I find when I'm really passionate about the work I'm doing when I'm really excited about what I'm doing let's get the rock on Matt's podcast where it's minimalism or anything else that's enough for me to avoid distraction because I am so excited about what I'm creating especially at the beginning of the day in the morning when I do my best to work that nothing else can really get in the way of that I love this idea of people have talked a lot about and I've talked a lot about this on the podcast and something I've been exploring and asking people is do you look at the comments how do you deal with feedback how do you deal with criticism there's some people who say don't look at any of it you know work with a blindfold on or at least work without a blindfold but then once you release it put a blindfold on and forget about what everybody's saying and then there's other people that's saying I respond to every single comment every single person that tweets at me I respond every YouTube comment I respond to good or bad every email I find myself somewhere in the middle there I don't think it's about absolutes I think I don't think you have to respond to every single comment or like every single comment I see a lot of them I see most of them when you're creating on these platforms you can't really hide from from the feedback and in the comments but to me it's not it doesn't really affect me as much anymore once you start creating and putting stuff on the internet especially on YouTube you know you'll get some some shitty comments I haven't gotten that much but it really doesn't bother me I kind of expected at this point but you have to go with your gut because say if you're not listening to people's feedback if you're if you're paying no attention at all to what anybody is saying you don't even know if people are listening to you or following you is that how you should create should you create with a complete blindfold where you don't even know if you're making an impact if what you're saying is getting through I don't think so I think a lot about you think about a street performer these are the people that get feedback instantaneously because they go out and they they perform and nobody listens nobody watches or they're all right I gotta do something a little bit differently this is obviously not entertaining people this is not exciting what can I do to make this exciting there is a negative side of that because if you keep doing that you might start asking the wrong questions and you might start creating clickbait and you might create just be focusing on creating really flashy thumbnails as opposed to focusing on the real work and what's really important so you gotta be looking at the right kind of feedback but I do think that you you have to be in tune with that I think a lot of this comes from your gut it's not a science it's not hey you know every ten comments you gotta look at and you know that's the one that you need to dedicate your life to or that's gonna change your mind about something no just keep an open mind keep looking at the feedback and understanding what you know might be stray what might not but you have to come back to your gut and say all right this is how I'm gonna move forward this is how we're gonna move on from here this is kind of a three-part question so how do you find your focus when your mind might be thinking about something else like I said you could put constraints on yourself find different constraints that you can add to your life there's I forget what the name there's so many of these ones though like some of the time tracker that tracks everything that you're doing online that's a nice one to see over a week or two how you're using social media how you dedicate your time it's kind of an eye opener some also will restrict access I've done this before where I you know restrict my access to Facebook or Twitter or other sites that during specific times where I'm like hey during six a.m. to 12 p.m. I really want to get all my work done so I'm gonna make these sites impossible to get to by using this app that blocks them and then other times I can check it and I can kind of feed that hamster mind but that might if you're really struggling with it that might be a solution for you to actually get jump started and pursue the right the right path in terms of managing those distractions how do you work large chunks of work or do you break it down into smaller tasks that really depends on whether it's a big project or a small project small projects I can get through pretty pretty quickly I mean at this point I've done I've added a thousand videos so for me to work on a 30 second or a minute spot it's gonna take me a half a day if not less if I especially if I'm working on it just myself and I don't have anybody else giving me feedback or saying hey you need to put it this direction that direction so for me working on the small projects I can I can tend to knock them out quick I just want to go beginning to end boom let's just finish this project as quick as possible how can I get through it and export it and then save it I usually don't rarely ever create something and release it on the same day sometimes I do but for the most part create a podcast episode or create the short videos and then I'll release it a week two weeks three weeks down the road that actually helps because sometimes the first go at it it's not the best go so I'll look back at this work this video that I did I just did this rich roll teaser which is called Get Started and I love it it's an I humbly will say it's an amazing video but like he's such a passionate guy so inspiring and he was just talking about like how you just need to get started and that we make so many excuses for not starting and I had to go through a couple of iterations I got some this guy Reese Robinson he's incredible he he lent me some of his footage that he shot with rich roll you know running and doing all these you know this is really beautiful athletic footage that he created so I needed to reach out to him to get the HD footage but I cut together one teaser as quickly as I could I got it done I was like this is great cool done and then a couple days later I'm like I look back at it because I wasn't gonna release it for another two weeks and I'm like hmm okay this can actually I could probably tweak this a little bit better I could adjust the timing a little bit maybe I can cut this phrase out hey let me try to add this phrase back in no that doesn't work so coming back to it helps I sometimes wonder like does anybody notice those little those subtleties but I notice and I think that's all that matters so for me I keep focusing on you know how can I improve how can I make this just a little bit better and for the small tasks that's how I get it done if the big tasks you have to break up into smaller increments so making minimalism was that let's just look at the post production it was the span of three to four months it was exhausting it was I loved it I hated it it was it was a project an a story that I had to tell but it was so difficult and and so challenging at times tell this story my first featured documentary my first time really ever telling a story over sixty minutes so there's so many moving pieces I did break it up into smaller chunks and smaller chapters to where even in final cut where I edited it they would be separate I think you call like it's like a nest that's what it used to be called it's called compound clip now where you can click on the clip like it looks really clean from the outset you would look at my entire timeline and it would be these 12 chapters that are 12 maybe like 15 I forget how many but all these different scenes and it would just look like oh well that's the the most simple timeline I've ever seen but then if you double click on any of them it opens up into this really complex structure and this really detailed look at every single shot every single clip sometimes 10 15 layers stacked on top of each other to make something work so I would just go one by one and I'd work on each of these and say okay this scene I feel this is the scene I'm going to be working on today I'm going to just get as much done as I can keep going through keep going through okay cool and then maybe tomorrow I don't feel really inspired to work on that scene so I work on another scene and it's this fluid process again coming back to the gut coming back to the experience that I have as a filmmaker and all the other projects that I've done knowing what I need to do I do keep a checklist so I use this app called to do it's T-E-U-X-D-E-U-X dot com and it's amazing it cost money it's a dollar was a dollar a month I don't know 10 or $30 a year so worth it this app is incredibly simple and it's how I organize my entire life it's literally just you know it just shows every day and I just focus on what I'm doing today there's certain things that I can push to tomorrow or two days in advance but it's just a simple checklist the simple two there's thousands of these apps but this one is the best for me it works the best for me they have a great app for the phone because they kept it incredibly simple and there's not all this extra shit on top of it that you don't need so for me it's like if I'm doing a big project like that I'm like work on this scene if I so I think of an idea also like oh man I should look at that Sam Harris interview I think I remember him saying something about meditation that might be able to fit here so then I would just put an extra in the two-do list check Sam Harris interview and then I'll remember oh yeah okay that's what I was or Sam Harris meditation interview something like that so it jogs my memory about what I'm looking to what I'm looking for because there are so many different moving pieces and so many different things you know you shoot 20 we in my film design disruptors we shot 80 interviews so it's really figuring out and organizing those thoughts as well as the work you need to do every day but I certainly do break it up Steven asks I gotta it she knows right I don't know if everybody's watching this on video but there's just like I got this itch on my nose it's like it won't go away I keep scratching it but it keeps itching anyway I'm really proud of this we've I'm going through all this in one take there's no edits it's gonna happen I might have just ruined it right now but that's what I wanted to do I was like I just want to go through here and spit ball off the top of my head getting an hour and I didn't think I was gonna do it that's another thing with these podcast episodes I do some are easier than others some the conversation doesn't flow as naturally I've got one coming up in two weeks I think with Alexis Wilkinson it's my favorite interview of all time it was crazy it's honestly it's hard to even explain what happened there was so we it was just it moved so fast and we barely even talked about our story it kind of like interweaved in between it but we just went on all these tangents it was hilarious I was dying by the end of it but those are conversations that I love and it's really easy but they're not all that easy and hers I think it was like an hour and 50 minutes we talked it was easy of flu by and actually I feel kind of bad when I'm like oh shit I probably shouldn't take up two hours at this person's time but I want to do some other interviews nothing about them but it's just the fact that there's you know whether it's me or it's a you know we're both having a bad day we're both like just not feeling as talkative it can be a little bit more challenging to to bring people stories out of them and to really have a conversation that's fluid sometimes people might be like overthinking it and thinking a little bit too much about how do I sound how do I want to get come across as opposed to you know this podcast format which is like long form conversation let's just chat and let's see where it goes and you know I do want to talk about your story but if there's something more interesting to talk about there's something more fun if there's something that's going to be more exciting my number one rule is if I'm enjoying the conversation other people are and that's really what they only think they guide to me I have to really make sure hey am I am I enjoying this I'm having fun am I learning something from this person and if I am then I think you guys well as well so so I'll be there anyway it comes back to sometimes I look down at the age six the recorder and it says like 15 minutes in and I'm like oh fuck shit how am I gonna because I have this every goal my goal for every episode is like at least an hour I got to get at least an hour like I can do an hour and you sometimes it's right at an hour sometimes it's like an hour 15 minutes but sometimes I look down at the the recorder and I'm like fuck 15 minutes in how am I possibly going to make this interesting engaging and stretch this out for an hour and but I do for like whatever you just keep going you keep going you think about new questions to ask that's why it's nice to have I usually have notes for every episode I rarely go to them but oftentimes say if I'm nervous I'm interviewing somebody that's really big I'll have a list of questions jotted out that I can always go back to in a pinch um Steven my question is how was the transition from NYC to LA I will move to the latter in a few days and I dream of living in the big Apple that's great well congrats on the move my move oh man it's been amazing we I'd not to hate on New York Natalie and I my girlfriend we moved to LA July 25th and so far for the few months that we've been here we absolutely love it New York is an amazing place it's inspiring it's captivating there is everything to do it also for me it's it can be a little bit claustrophobic it can be a little bit grungy a little bit too absorbed in the hustle I love hustle I work hard but there's like a stressful hustle when you're out on the streets of New York and you're in the subway and you're commuting to work and you're doing these things that pulls you in a direction that you have no control over and I find myself after being in New York for it's a three month you know I live there for close to five years between Hoboken and Brooklyn and I find myself so like say I'm there for three months straight and then I go to visit my parents in Jersey and all the sun I feel it's like wait off my shoulders like I feel like oh wow I've been tense this whole time I've been just like for whatever reason I've been anxious maybe it's the buildings the traffic the noise but coming to LA I don't feel that as much you feel it a little bit I mean we're still in the city we live in West Hollywood so we're kind of in the middle of it nothing like New York but there is this frenetic energy to New York that is hard to escape and hard to avoid but coming to LA has been amazing the weather I mean the weather people if people are gonna hate me because everybody hates the people from LA that always talk about the weather and all this stuff I the traffic has been fine I haven't really been worried about that the it's just it's been it's been great we've honestly settled in so quick it didn't take any time at all for us to really feel like this was home the hardest part is being away from family for sure like that's a challenge it's always gonna be a challenge as you grow up I've got a big family I've got I come from a family of seven kids so I've got six siblings out there my sister Michelle's in LA my brother Mark and sister in law Courtney and nephew Oliver are in Philadelphia a couple of the girls are back home still my brother Mike's and Virginia I don't know I decided to go through everybody Megan she's an outside of Philadelphia so everybody's just all over the place and but that's just the way it is that's what happens when you grow up is that our lives pull us in different directions and you have to be okay with that and you have to accept that your journey is going to be a little bit different than others but for me it's like really important to make sure that I keep my family close and I go home and I make visits and trips as often as I can as often as my schedule allows it to just be close to family so that means and you know the extra challenge that we have is that Natalie is from Australia so I mean I give her so much credit because that's got to be so hard to be that far away from family and most of your friends like a lot of her friends thankfully they kind of have also taken different paths and they're in London and they're all over the world but a lot of her friends are still in Australia and it's like how do you manage those relationships how do you stay close with people technology has helped a lot but for us it's like all right let's go back to we switch Chris misses every year now so this Chris last Christmas we're in Australia this Christmas will be in New Jersey it's not that I can't really complain about visiting Australia more often because I love it it's amazing it's such a beautiful country also gay gay rights and gay marriage just was legalized well not legalized they passed I don't know it's kind of complicated story but they just had a vote and the vote went through to legalized gay marriage I'm not sure if it's going to go into fact soon but that's amazing so that's exciting and that's that's my hamster brain just running off in circles but it's family so important friends are so important relationships are everything so we just really need to make sure that we keep those in balance Todd my reason for emailing is we're in the middle post production of our documentary film finding HIG and I have a lot of questions about distribution and getting our film to as many eyes as possible do you have any resources you can point me to or any advice based on your experience with minimalism that may be of help to us yeah so I do have a series called making minimalism which is a six part series where I interview with Josh and Ryan from the minimalist and spire the media company that we partnered up with to help execute and bring this film to life it was in easy but we didn't focus on distribution upfront we were the one nice thing was that Josh and Ryan had an audience you know it wasn't as big as it is now but they had an audience that we could release this film to and that's all we thought it was going to be it was all right let's just really focus on making the best film we can we're really passionate about this story this idea and this message and we think it will help a lot of people let's focus on that how can we best tell this story how can we best emotionally move people to take action in their lives to simplify their lives and to focus on living more meaningful and more fulfilled lives to focus on the important things and that was really that's as all we focused on but then of course once you finish the film now we're how do we how do we you know get this in front of people we did a theatrical run through gather a distribution company that allowed us to put it in like 500 theaters around the country that was really fun really exciting things are changing now I wouldn't recommend doing that a lot of time a lot of energy and a lot of money like I think we got a revenue of 300,000, 280,000 dollars through the theaters barely made any money from that like I think it was you know after we honestly I didn't didn't even break even from our production costs and everything that we spent on distribution up until that point and like going to film festivals and all stuff so we didn't even make any money from the theater on that's why I say it's probably not the best idea because 50% goes at the theaters 50% that's left over goes to the distribution company and there's all these other fees that you have to pay out and then by the end of the day we're making a couple thousand dollars on that like $280,000 so because the thing to keep in mind is is that money is important and you should be able to get paid for your art and in the beginning I was like I just want to make my money back on this thing and I think that was a great and a noble goal but at the end of the day I want to keep doing this this was such an amazing experience and I got to make this film that that touched a lot of people and I want to keep doing that and keep making films that hopefully can get people to question things and dig a little bit deeper in their own lives so for me minimalism was the chance for me to say all right like I want to do this again but I need to actually make a profit and he takes you make money and we ended up doing that like by getting it on Netflix and doing this other stuff we got on Netflix through third party company third party companies helped to partner with us so like that was obviously a challenging role the advice I would give to you if you're trying to get distribution for your film you know make sure you have a really amazing trailer cut together a short trailer it's sort of reaching out to these companies there's so many media companies like Hulu, Netflix, Comcast has won all these companies have one and they're really hungry for good content so you have to make a good film first and a good trailer to captivate because even if it's a good film people probably are going to watch it if you don't have good media surrounding it as in good trailers good imagery beautiful design these kind of things pull people in and let them know that what you're creating is legit but if you have an amazing film and you can cut together an amazing trailer just bust your ass to get in the door don't spam people make connections it's always better to have the connections in place before you even start the film so now we actually have a connection we didn't have one before but we have one with Netflix and we've gotten to meet some of the people over there they're totally amazing but we have a foot in the door you know and that doesn't mean they're going to accept our next project chances are they probably won't and they've been up front with us about that that you know what there's no guarantees but we will happily you know watch what you guys are creating and explore ideas with you and help you out and actually help you to craft the projects that you're creating so it's building those relationships before you get into it if you don't have the relationships make really dope shit make an amazing film and a good book for you to read would be Seth Godan's purple cow it's just about you'd be so good people can ignore you if you go past a field and you see a bunch of cows that all of the same but one looks purple that stands out you say oh wow okay that's a purple cow I think I'm not doing a justice to this book but it's this idea of just be unique be original and your work will stand for itself and that's really the best if I said I could give you Todd so good luck on your film one last question here Blake are you making a living off of your own projects i.e. films youtube podcast or are you taking on client work as well what does that model look like for you yes and no this podcast makes me no money youtube makes me no money instagram facebook twitter my original projects unstuck my newsletter doesn't make me any money I make no money which is good to have a girlfriend like Natalie she's very successful and she keeps my sanity because I know even if shit hits the fan even if I don't make any money this year or next year she'll be there to support me and as I pursue these crazy big ideas um I minimalism has made money and has it made me a profit and it's given me a little bit of runway here in addition to the client work that I've done so I've done client work for years and it's allowed me to and I've been really smart with my money I paid off all my debt so early on when I was talking about the $117,000 in debt that I was in I was able to pay that off and that is allowed me a freedom to stop today doing client work so I recently finished up my last client project and now I'm able to focus on more ambitious ideas bigger ideas crazy ideas that I otherwise wouldn't have been able to do I'm able to focus on this podcast and put a lot of time and energy into it I'm able to focus on making these youtube videos things that are a lot of these are just experiments this podcast is an experiment it's an attempt to do something a little bit different to make engaging video content through a podcast is something that hasn't I mean it's been done but it hasn't been done in the most cinematic way possible and what I'm trying to do is like which you might have seen on rich roles episode he talked about it's like elevating the level how can you elevate podcasting to a new level and I can't assume an expect to make money in the very beginning and and I don't know if I ever will or I'll ever monetize the podcast I don't think I will ever add advertisements on here so that it makes me more focused and more engaged less on the money I'm not focusing on the money focusing how do I make the best thing I can how to make the best podcast possible how do I continue to make this episode better than the past episode better than the past episode and that to me is what drives me so the client work is done I'm not doing any more client work minimalism I still make a little bit of money from that like every quarter we get some sales in which which helps me to keep going and keep pursuing this thing and I was really smart about it I took calculated risks I paid off all my debt and I saved up a bunch of money to the point where I was comfortable taking a step away from making money and and that to me it was important for me to tackle this and I had Natalie support from the beginning which is everything and there's a lot of uncertainty there is I don't know if it's gonna work if the pieces are gonna fall together but I'm enjoying it and I love every single day waking up in the morning and being able to work on my own projects being able to work on things that I'm passionate about I can't tell you how amazing that feels and I think that's a good good place to leave this episode off once again thank you guys so much for being a part of this journey thank you so much for listening to this podcast and asking me a really thoughtful questions if you want to be a part of the next AMA stand up for my newsletter and then I will I'm gonna for at least the time being I think that's a nice way to help out the newsletter give them a chance to ask questions I get to everyone so please feel free to do
