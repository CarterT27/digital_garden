## Transcript
 I feel like a lot of your your soundtracks can be very simple in terms of the bill. Sometimes one track might just be strings or it may at least be strings for 45 seconds and it's kind of building that tension. How do you go about? Because I know a simple song or a simple film or a simple edit never starts out simple and it's never obvious how do you go about getting to that point. I always think it's way easier to edit down from from wealth than to try and like um I don't know scratch together like simple things to get bigger and so and I also think like it's really hard to come up with an original simple idea out of thin air. I don't trust it usually like if I have like a little melody in my head and I'm like oh it's like a cool little melody so like work and it just came out of nowhere. It scares me because I'm like where did I come up with that? Or is it like actually just something I heard somewhere because it's happened to me like early on in doing this like I had had some moments either songwriting or score writing where I like just had just was walking around and just had like a idea just like clicking like this little melody like a piano and go home like write it in super like get into it and start working on it and then like a week later just click and be like that is an actual Andrew Bird song that I just recreated on my computer without realizing wow that it's just it was swirling in my head and so somehow I decided that I wrote it. Is that scares me? That's very scary. You know the turn around is fast doing score music so I don't trust those random stray ideas because they may just be versions of something else I've been listening to and I may not have enough time to realize that and I don't want to be the only one that doesn't notice that it's exactly a copy of something you know like that that stuff scares me and music's mysterious in that way it's kind of hard to keep track of like originality in that sense. So I like to have a good I like to know where my influence is coming from I like to know where the ideas are coming from and I like to start by making things that are a little overboard so my approach usually is to try and score every single scene in a film that every place that it seems like there could ever you'd ever think to have music let's try music there I'm gonna write one or two ideas for it and then I'm gonna make everything kind of like as full as I can think to do it and then we'll start taking away and when you have something that you think is interesting and is like kind of more of a full-on composition and is kind of more fleshed out and probably a little more heavy handed like and direct you start to like take things away based on what it feels like it needs it usually gets more and more original because a lot of times it's like I'll start maybe I started with like a piano like writing some chords and then I kind of played something on top of that and then I had some guitar in that and then we had some strings and I'm like kind of building something up and then the last idea I have because maybe something feels like oh this feels like it needs to be more beautiful or something and so then maybe there's like some flutes going top of it then a month later we are whittling down or taking things away we end up taking away that piano that I started with and taking away the guitar and now the flutes are like the thing and I'm building around the flutes and so it's like if something goes to a process like that then I kind of contrast that it is ours and it's unique to the film and I also contrast that it's going to serve the project creatively because we've given it enough time to see what's working and like try it with and without different things and kind of whittled down like what is the what is the essential thing that's happening that's like working and let's just get rid of everything else say you start out with the piano and you go through this whole progression of adding adding adding and like say the last thing you add is the flute and then eventually it comes down to it where almost the flute carries this whole song I think that goes against our intuition our intuition is the piano made the song so the piano has to stay the piano has to stay was that always obvious to you and how do you I think there's I forget who said it but it's like kill your darlings like the things that you love about something originally or what you might see as the best part of it you might eventually have to remove it because it doesn't it doesn't fulfill the story or the role it probably used to be but I get excited about it now and it's not hard for me to leave that stuff behind sometimes it is if I just really love and it's more I usually get more stuck on like if I just write a piece of music and I'm like I love this and then the scene keeps changing and it's making less and less sense in that scene but I'm like damn I like that I like the way that music played for that scene before so I'm like we'll hold on to it maybe a little bit just because I like the piece and I don't want to see it get tampered with but I usually get excited for things to change because I usually know where that initial idea came from because like I said I like to track it I like to know that I like to have inspiration that's left field like for instance when I was getting into the grateful dead there's like this chord change and it's like really like bluesy kind of like rock and tune that I heard that I was like I liked the way it made me feel and I wrote that like I used that chord change for this like really pretty slow or cestral piece for the glass castle and I like I don't really like worry about like ripping off that idea of going from this chord to this chord because I'm using it in such a different way I like having that anchor that I know that that's where that idea came from so I know I didn't just steal it from some other orchestral music that sounds really you know that's like in the same wheelhouse and then I like the idea because I do usually track those those like initial like what I like to do is I'll I'll I'll like listen a lot of music I'll make some demos I'll start scratching down an idea and as soon as that idea is generally there I shut that session start something new it'll make 10 or 15 ideas and then I'll open those back up the next day sometimes I remember where I got that idea sometimes I don't but I'll like listen back to what I made and then see if there's anything interesting there or see if maybe start adding to it and like I'll kind of just move really quickly as a way of trying to like leave behind whatever it was that initially gave me that idea because I like growing beyond it and I like it's exciting to sometimes the very last like past that I do want to piece of music is the thing that makes it like special or is like it'll be when I add some little like decoration that is the thing people hear that's like oh that's a cool little thing so I kind of like doing that and I think it's also like a good process I think filmmakers especially ones that don't that are little filmmakers always tell me like I'm not a musician so I don't know it's going on but that's not really usually the problem it's it's usually more I feel like some filmmakers are just a little scared of music because it just feels like so like open-ended and so there'll be a piece that they like and they'll be like I really like this I like this about it and sometimes you get a little stuck on them more thinking like it's I think I like the piano in this and it's me trying to break like no I think you like just the overall energy of this I don't know that it needs to be piano and Sufian Steven's voice to like to get the feeling that you need and so helping workshop that and being like let's figure out what's working about that and try and do our own thing because um I don't know yeah the killer darling's thing is like it can be tough if you guys are excited about something but for me usually it's just as it is the way towards something that is going to be more interesting and I feel like the bolder I am with that I'm like learning that usually I'm looking back at my work wherever I was the most bold in doing that is like has led to the music that I'm the most excited about later when I'm looking back and you know that's a cool piece of music that we ended up with there and it's usually because we're like let's just cut off all the stuff that seems safe and like go with it.
