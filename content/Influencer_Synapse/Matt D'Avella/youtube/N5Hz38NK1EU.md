In 2014 my friends and I set out to make a feature-length documentary. The problem: we had never done anything like this before.

Minimalism was one of the biggest and most challenging projects Iâ€™ve ever worked on in my life. In this new series I take you behind the scenes to deconstruct how we went from nothing to Netflix. How did we land the big interviews? Where did our budget come from? How did we know what to keep and what to cut?

You'll learn about our process, the mistakes we made, and why we decided to tell the story like we did. It's a new behind the scenes series I'm creating called Making Minimalism.

## Transcript
 So my friends and I made a movie. It's called Minimalism, a documentary about the important things, and I'm going to tell you a little secret. When we first started out, we had no idea what we were doing. We were doing this incoherent, the documentary. I went in before I was right in that. Now I'm looking back at the past three years it took to bring it to life. I'm deconstructing every important step along the way. It's a good luck with that. All the big mistakes break throughs and profound discoveries. One, two, three, four, five. How do we land the big interviews? What gear did we use? How do we fund it? In terms of budget, it was about as minimal as you could get. A zero dollars. It's a new mini series that I'm creating called Making Minimalism. We've got to go in the shot. I'll tell you, your camera is right now. No? Still. You're still in the shot right now. Yeah. Right here? Yeah. There you are. Subscribe to this channel for more videos.
