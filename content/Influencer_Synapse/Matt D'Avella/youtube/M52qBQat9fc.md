I graduated college in 2010 with $95,000 in student loan debt and did the smartest thing I could think of at the time. I bought a brand new car.

Back then I was living in my parent's basement in New Jersey while trying to make it as a filmmaker. At my lowest point I had $13 in the bank. Then I plugged my finances into a net-worth calculator online and realized I actually had negative money. I was worse than "worthless".

In this podcast episode I talk about my story with money and how it's evolved over the years.

## Transcript
 Hello listeners and watchers, this is the ground up show and I'm doing something special now. If you haven't heard, releasing the producer interviews for my series Making Minimalism. So I have a series called Making Minimalism where I deconstructed what it took to make our documentary. Minimalism, it was an insane road, it was one of the hardest things I'd done but also one of the most fulfilling and I did interviews with Josh and Ryan from Minimalism.com, Jeff Marla and Dave from Spire, that's a media company, they do some pretty amazing stuff over there. So I kind of had these conversations with them pretty informal and I just wanted to get to the bottom and figure out how the hell we were able to do this and how the hell we were able to get on Netflix because it's not something any of us had ever done before, it's not something any of us ever expected to get any success out of. So I wanted to do you construct and figure out how this was possible. So I'm releasing the full interviews, the extended interviews, it's about two hours or so of content with all my producers to people who review this podcast on iTunes, reviews on the podcast are a really important way to get the word out about the show, to hopefully get it to a place where other people can hear from me and learn about my message and also learn from the people that I'm sitting down with and talking to. So leave a review, take a screenshot and send it to helloatmatdeevelop.com, that's helloatmatdeevelop.com and I really appreciate your support, it would be a huge help and without further ado, this is episode 14 of The Ground Up Show. Today, I want to talk about money. My story really starts in college, I mean I guess I was 18, 18 years old, I decided to go to college and not go to an in-state school, I decided to go to an out-of-state school and with that, pay a lot of money to go to college. I started out at Bloomsburg University, eventually transferred to Temple University in Philadelphia. Both schools very expensive, unrealistically expensive, I was paying about $20,000 every year to go there, so yeah it adds up and then I did something very dumb, my final year of college. This was the summer of 2010, I should have graduated in the spring but I didn't take all my core requirements, so I had to stay after and take classes over the summer and I kid you not, the classes that I took that summer were algebra and weightlifting. I didn't technically need to take weightlifting, that was, I just needed to take some kind of recreational course requirement, but I ended up spending $10,000 that summer, it was a massive mistake not to plan ahead of time and make sure I didn't make a mistake like that that would leave me not only to delay me getting out and working and getting out of school but also to take the burden of the extra money. I graduated in 2010, eventually, with $95,000 in student loan debt and I did the absolute smartest thing I could think of at the time, I bought a brand new car, so it wasn't anything fancy, it was a 2010 Kia Fortay coupe, I guess it was a little fancy, it was a two door, it was literally the car that was on the showroom floor, I remember going around with my dad and we were looking at different cars and I was really against the Kia at the time because I was kind of caught up into brands and material trappings and I was like, nah, I don't want to get a Kia, I was looking at Mazdas which were super expensive and apparently I think pretty hard to maintain and fix up. I'm a big car guy, I own a Kia, so then eventually we go back to this Kia dealership and then I see this car and it's on the dealership floor and it's a 2010 and at this point we're kicking in at 2011 and I was like, oh man, this car is pretty damn sweet, it's like it had music or lights that synced up with the music, it had nice rims, it had fake leather interior and for a Kia it was a pretty damn nice car, I got to give him credit, they made a nice car and then I bought it without really thinking about the consequences and thinking about okay this is going to be you know $300 a month for the next five years. Not to mention the debt that I was in so at this point I'm about $ 115,000 give or take in debt and I didn't really want to think about it, I didn't want to look at it, focus it at it, I just wanted to it was I kind of buried it in the back of my mind but it always was there whether I wanted to ignore it or keep going this was a weight that was that was on me and that was holding me down and holding me back from doing what I really wanted to do because the the sheer reality of the situation was that if I wanted to move out from my parents' basement I was quite literally living my parents' basement at this time if I wanted to move out I had to pay off that debt that was the the the the reality of the situation I had at that point about seven hundred and twenty dollars per month of loan payments which is what I would be paying in rent if I was living in a city like Philadelphia and I couldn't there is no way I could do both because at that time I wasn't making a lot of money I was starting to build up my company and my freelance business but you know I would have some product my regular projects was an event that I shot and Philly that was every every other month and I'd make four hundred dollars if you do the math that's two hundred dollars a month and not enough money to pay rent let alone my student loan debt so this is the story this is my story was the guy that was in debt and it was my story for for a very long time and I kind of there came a point when I had to take responsibility and it was around the same time that I started to get into minimalism in self development I kind of being somebody who was entrepreneurial in spirit ran up freelance business had to be self motivated I decided to really take responsibility for myself in every aspect of my life and money was one of those big ones so a couple of the books that I read early on the first book that I read if anybody is into personal development or personal finances you've heard of Dave Ramsey he's he's brilliant he's kind of he's got to be the biggest voice in the personal finance space and he wrote a book called I will no that's that's for me say he wrote a book called the total money makeover another guy of remit city wrote I will teach you to be rich also a pretty damn good book countering philosophies there but the the total money makeover was by Dave Ramsey was really a turning point for me because it gave me a bit of a game plan now the funny thing about you reading any book on personal finance when you're in debt is that you can only get through the first three chapters because after the first three chapters they started to get into specific details about what to do with money after you get out of debt because getting out of debt is step one for the most part so I remember reading these books back in the back of the day in 2010 which is like a long time ago now think about it seven years ago I remember thinking man I can't wait to pick this book up in two three years when I get out of debt I was pretty ambitious I I actually started a website called the two year payoff which it died within a couple of months my drive to get rid of my debt didn't die but I didn't keep up posting on that blog but I was my plan I was like let me just think of the craziest most unrealistic goal imaginable I want to pay off all my student loans in two years and that's what I did I didn't pay it off in two years but that was my goal and I think the biggest thing for me was creating the mindset so now that I and actually I will say that the mindset really initiated when I plugged in all my personal finances all my accounts into mint.com so I put everything in mint.com which is it's a website I don't know if I I would recommend it like it's it's not bad basically you can upload all your accounts there there's advertising on there so it can be a little bit annoying and they're trying to sell you credit cards cards which can be counterintuitive but to plug everything in there and to to see that my net worth was a negative 115 thousand dollars was an eye-opening experience to say the least to see that I thought that I didn't I I thought that I like was poor but to know that you're negative money and such a significant factor of negative money of negative 115 thousand dollars felt insurmountable I didn't think I could ever get out of it but then I was like fuck it I can do this and I'm kind of motivated by all these books that I'm reading and these blogs and people that are talking about this stuff so I feel like I can actually do it there's obviously a doubt in the back of my mind like dude you can't you totally can't do it that's this is going to be impossible but guided by the wisdom of others who have traded this path before me I just said I'm going to go for it I'm going to try to pay off my debt in two years and I started down this path and the biggest thing was this mindset so I created this mindset that so I'm running a business I'm starting to make some money you know at the time man I like literally I had I would like to say I had a savings right when I moved home but I had about $13 in the bank quite I distinctly remember having $13 in the bank and then overdrafting on that and asking my mom for money so I was really starting at ground zero I had absolutely no money but I remember thinking that I need to to I need to start developing some income generating more business and you know even in my best months at that time I probably got up to like $4,000 a month maybe $5,000 a month that's like if it was a really good month which is amazing and living at home that's I have very little expenses when I'm running my business at home I wasn't hiring a lot of other people so I was doing all of the work but I was getting all of the reward I was getting on the profit I might have had a margin of like 95% 90% of return it's like I got to pay for came or gear and all this stuff but most of the money I was keeping myself but out of all that money that I was keeping or at least temporarily bringing into my checking account I didn't see it as my every single dime I made I was like that's the bank's money that's the bank's money every project I got if it was a big project I saw that as the bank's money so money came in and I would save up quite a bit I would save up say 15,000 20,000 dollars at a time or over the course of a few months and then I would take that as a lump sum saving a little bit a couple of thousand dollars to be safe and I would take the rest of that money and I would throw it towards my debt and then just chip away at it and I kind of so there's these two school thoughts in terms of getting read a debt there's one that's strictly by the numbers which is you're gonna be paying off the highest interest loans and then there's the snowball effect where you're paying off the the smallest loans so save you have like 1,000 dollar credit card loan you want to pay that off first because then it feels like a good win it's more psychological it's based upon how humans actually react I did a little bit of a mix of both so my biggest loan was about 25, 27,000 dollars from I was like American education services and I figured like it was a 7% or 8% interest rate loan which is pretty damn high but I was like I like just chip in away at that it's gonna take me forever to pay off at 25,000 dollars and I'm not gonna feel like basically also what I wanted to do was reduce my monthly expenses so I wanted to be able to move out that was my goal move out of my parents house if I can move out and if I can get rid of some of this burden of debt I'll be in a good position so I started to pay some of these smaller loans that that equal to higher monthly portion of my of my debt and of my expenses so over time over you know two years I lived at home I wasn't able to pay off all my debt but I got to the point where I paid off probably about half which was amazing because that's about 50 to $60,000 it's a lot of money to chip away at but not only that it the $60,000 was great to get rid of but my monthly burden was a lot less so instead of $700 a month I think I got to the point where I was I paid off my car when I moved out and I had about it was about $300 a month so I had significantly reduced the amount of monthly expenses that way I could actually afford an apartment and but I was still focused on art I got to pay off this debt I need to get rid of this so I continued for the next year and a half to two years and it was in I believe 2014 2015 where I finally paid off my final student loan debt and I remember in the in the beginning when I initially started this journey of paying off my debt I wrote based on Adam Baker he has a pretty great blog about personal finance and he he said write a letter of forgiveness forgive yourself for this debt that you're in because a lot times our mindset is just to be guilty and to beat ourself up about the position that we're in but so I remember I still have it here but I I don't know if it's on this computer let me see I don't think so I have no idea where it is but like I wrote a letter of forgiveness to myself and basically said you know this is not your fault at 18 years old you made a mistake to get into this amount of debt at 24 you made a 23 you made a mistake to buy a brand new car when you were already in debt but now you're on the right path now you're on the path to actually clear and get rid of this debt so I forgive myself for it and I also propose this as a challenge and one of the greatest challenges that I would ever face in my life and instead of being in debt for 30 to 40 years which was very likely scenario I said I want to pay this shit off in two to three years that's I want to get I want to get rid of this so that I can have personal freedom I can have the the personal finance freedom to be able to do what I want take the projects I won't do the jobs I want which is the point where I'm at now which is a pretty amazing transition point to be in it's still terrifying like I I'm maybe that's part of my DNA but it's always going to be scary I think when you're making these drastic changes in your life but being debt free now I can't tell you the feeling that I get it's something that I have to constantly remind myself to be thankful for that I'm no longer in debt that I no longer have this burden weighing me down that now I can and really focus on on more meaningful work more meaningful projects and I don't have to if I don't want to do weddings I don't have to if I want to do them I could if I if I don't want to do bar myths of videos client work at all I don't have to do it I don't have to work for money money is not my main driving factor which is kind of an interesting dichotomy if you think about it because money was a driving factor for me for a very long time I guess it was if you look deeper it was the freedom but but it was I want to make money so then I can get out of debt and then I don't have to focus on making money as a sole source of of what I'm doing so that's in part my money story and I gotta tell you for anybody who's on this path to to get out of debt to reduce the the financial burden on themselves it's worth it and you can do it and even if right now it doesn't seem like it's possible you have to start because if I didn't start then in 2010 when would I have started when I started to make a little bit more money what is that when I would have turned things around I don't think so I think that there would have been no line to be drawn to when I start paying off my debt and when I just spend this money for this way um brings me to another point that you do have to enjoy the process and you do have to enjoy you do have to enjoy the process and you do have to enjoy some of the money that you're making you're working you're you're working to you know to to meet your basic expenses to to pay off your rent and your debt and all that but at the same time you you need to actually enjoy it and go out and have fun and don't be totally frigid with your your money and everyone's gonna treat yourself I usually if I if I land a big project or if I complete a big project then the client loves it I'll um I'll leave that as an excuse to go out to a nice dinner or buy a nice bottle of whiskey or scotch there there are certain things where you do need to treat yourself because at the other day if you're busing your ass and making a lot of money um and you're not actually enjoying it then then what's the point it's not worth it so some of my recommendations I mentioned them a little bit earlier in the podcast about books but I 100% I recommend if you haven't read it Dave Ramsey's the total money makeover is a game changer it's got some religious aspects to it the religious undertone at times I'm not a religious guy but uh totally if you're not religious yourself it's still completely an enjoyable book and also motivating so there's stories throughout of people who themselves have gotten out of debt and who are on the journey to pay off their debt and so it's it's a it's a progressive story there's people pretty much across every aspect of their their personal finance goals so people that have paid off a couple thousand dollars people paid off a hundred thousand dollars so it's nice to be able to see the people at different points progression um check that book out Ramsey say the I will teach you to be rich so I said I mentioned he that book is fantastic Remi is genius he's he's very intelligent and and has um he's he's so he's the kind of guy he would tell you different advice from Dave Ramsey so he'll tell you don't pinch pennies don't sacrifice on the latte every day the three dollar latte you spend every day isn't going to add up to a whole lot in over the course of your life it's not going to be the biggest way for you to save money and to pay off your debt he says go for the big wins so the big wins is reducing the interest rate on your home if you're going to buy a home or maybe don't buy a home maybe just rent and save money that way like weighing the pros and cons of that decision I think is very important a lot of people just enter into these things because they think that's what they're supposed to do um the weddings or super expensive and what ways could you reduce the cost of your wedding maybe don't get married no seriously like I don't know you you make that decision for yourself um what else a car like car payments incredibly expensive get a used car get a reliable car drive it to the freaking ground um these are ways in which you can really maximize your savings so with a house if you save a couple interest points that's tens of thousands of dollars you're not going to be able to save that money by skipping the latte every once in a while um so remit sati he's really good he'll also encourage you that if you're responsible you can own a credit card Dave Ramsey will tell you not to own a credit card at all cut them all up never use them um and I know people who work both schools of thoughts and originally I was on Dave Ramsey's side and I was like I don't need a credit card I'm just gonna cut it up get rid of it and then once I got out of debt I decided you know what having a credit card I have a lot of business expenses I'm you know spending tens of thousands of dollars on camera gear I think that this could benefit me to have a credit card to if down the road I won a buy a house if um Natalie wants to buy a house that this is something that is now an option because I've built up good credit uh it's a bullshit system that that you need to show that your um that that you just the whole credit score system is it's entirely made up of of dog shit but it's just part of the game sometimes you got to play the game so that's what I'm doing right now I'm playing the game and I get some points for travel and that's stuff so we're going to Miami in a couple of weeks for fun uh these are things that you can do for free too because I'm paying through all through points so these are some of the things that that come in when you have a credit card but of course if you're not responsible if you don't trust yourself cut up your credit card don't use it Tony Robbins has been getting really into personal finance lately he's got two books the most recent one and the most um approachable is unshakable and that's a book that I'm halfway through right now and the thing that I'll leave you on is that personal finance uh is a journey and it's something that you need to continually work at and it's something that you need to continually put yourself into the right mindset so every single year I read without fail I will read a book on personal finance so whether it's Dave Ranzi, Remeatsady or Tony Robbins I will reread Dave Ranzi's book maybe three or four times because to put yourself in that mindset to understand why you're doing this to understand the kind of freedom that you're pursuing and continue to pursue and to understand what's important and you know is it important to get the new iPhone or is it important perhaps to put that money towards your 401k in your retirement and to have that security down the road which is going to feel better to you so I do this every single year and I encourage you guys to do the same read a book on personal finance I say start with Dave Ranzi but you can read any of them Tony Robbins is great Remeatsady's great and that's it so that's my money story I'd love to hear from you guys to hear what your money story is um if you could leave a comment on this YouTube video or if you shoot an email to helloatmetdeevela.com those are two great ways to tell me about your money story and also ask any questions about personal finance and maybe I can give you guys some advice based upon my journey thanks for watching
