## Transcript
 Was there any points where you felt like I'm not ready for this? Holy shit, like every job Seriously, yeah Can I get an introduction from you? So your name and show it is that you do hi I'm Matt Webb. I'm an assistant director and producer from Sydney, Australia now living in New York I'm going to pull up an apple your IMDV because you've worked on some pretty damn awesome projects Hacksaw Ridge was that was pretty recent, right? Yeah. Yeah, so that was we shot that in the last often 2015 how shit and I'm really lost you do I am Natalie and I were in Melbourne actually and we were staying at this like it was like a bougie tent hotel on top of a roof at some hotel and then she wanted to go to a museum. I don't really like museums like they're cool but I'm not really that big into them and then I saw Hacksaw Ridge was playing so I went to Hacksaw Ridge On your own yeah, on my own by myself and it was me and like a bunch of 40 to 50 year olds and then Natalie went to the she went to the art gallery by herself Well it's an interesting film because everybody thinks it's a war film and it's going to be killing more the whole entire time but it starts off as a love story really it starts off as a drama for probably two thirds and then they eventually end up in Japan in the war and that's when it really goes mental Yeah there is like really a slow build up to the war which is like yeah going into it you don't expect it real quick so great Gatsby Mad Max like a lot of the this is these are all filmed in Australia Yeah, so that's dope and I want to what we can talk about these films and some of these projects and what you've done along the way also a book set life this is great this feels like a like a show like an actual show We've got presents for everything this is great man. I haven't gotten a chance to check this out yet, but I really want to read it so this is about your story kind of advice for this is kind of what the podcast about it's advice for people who are just getting started out who are trying to make their own Yeah exactly it's not like a memoir or anything like that it's just tips and advice for people starting out in the film industry based on my experiences and and other people there's about 10 interviews in there as well with people at the top of their game a couple of them of one Oscars production designers first AD's producers everybody so it shows a great scope of people and what they do do this is fantastic this is like really well put they get like even like this is professional because I know you know sometimes you can you didn't make this through like the Amazon there's like an Amazon thing where you can kind of print books and you start for no that one was printed in Australia so that's for through the distribution in Australia but you can't buy it on Amazon print on demand yeah this is beautiful I get when did you know that you wanted to get into to film as a teenager I started getting into it and it came out of just buying a video camera and filming friends doing dumb stuff so whether it be surfing or hanging out or writing motorbikes or going snowboarding or that kind of stuff I just would take my camera and start filming things and then putting it together on my laptop and that would be terrible edits but my mum would say it was great and friends would watch it that kind of stuff and it's so evolved and grew and then eventually started buying better equipment and not that that made any difference or still about what I was shooting which is always just dumb pranks and and guys being guys as like teenagers dude I actually did the same thing that's so funny I forgot about it and I've never talked about it on the podcast but um I forget the name of it but we would go out and like the pranks were they were like mean it's like you know now it's like cool prank but you just like ruined person's life like I remember we wrapped my one at like 4 a.m. we wrapped my one friend's Jeep in Seran wrap the entire thing and we filmed it and then because he had to go to work the next morning at like 6 a.m. or so and we kept calling I'm trying to get him to come out but he didn't wouldn't pick up and then like we heard because we didn't wait around for it and then he was so pissed off but like he was late to work that day had to unwrap it but it was uh that's how I got started out too it was just like was this like the jackass days is that did I just find it but it was a little bit different we were just more looking for the adventure rather than being cruel to people or really inflicting pain we weren't about that but we did dumb things like I remember we set a couple of guys on fire because we could we'd seen it being done before so you just wrapped them in heaps of layers of clothing and then put some carousine on them and and lit them on fire and now doing this for a while and then jumped off a bridge into the water holy shit you still have this footage yeah it's on YouTube I think oh that's incredible you said we we were trying to hurt anybody but we just lit some people on fire well that will volunteer so I mean that'll part of the group that we're that they chose to do it yeah it's between running up to somebody and letting them look like yeah we were just scaring people in public or anything like that another little episode we did was called Pimp My Paddock Basha which is not no idea I don't know if that's an Australian thing like paddock dasher basha paddock basha so it's like an old car that you just trash in a paddock yeah like like a rally car right so we got an old car and spray painted it and put like a cardboard body kit on it and then had a race around a track in a friend's backyard that's amazing that was all based on the Pimp My Rads yeah yeah yeah yeah a lot of things like that see a lot of the influences based upon that watch MTV and then go out and film your runs yeah and then the more they put those dislaimers do not try this at home the more people feel inspired to have a challenge yeah exactly uh totally did the same thing and then so you you kind it sounds like you started in a very similar way to me and then you kept buying new gear this is before college this was high school then yeah yeah end of high school 17 18 and then how did that progress and then you you decide all right like this is why I want to try to actually did you feel like you could do this for a living yeah I was always interested in doing it I wasn't sure exactly why I wasn't sure if I wanted to be a director or in post production or producing or I knew I didn't want to be an actor I never wanted to be on the camera but yeah I wasn't sure I took a year off straight after school and came and lived in Colorado for six months to ski season and then worked and went to college and that's when I was studying filmmaking and even at the end of my degree I still wasn't sure what I wanted to do like after studying people like I'm a D-P now it's like no you're not you've just got a college degree yeah you did just do so any title yeah some people knew they wanted to be writers or directors uh I still wasn't sure I knew what I didn't want to be I didn't want to be an editor because I just hate sitting there and editing but I knew I wanted to be involved in big projects the big films always interested me so you didn't want to do like the smile projects you wanted to and that seems to be like more difficult it's like how do you jump right into doing yeah look I was happy to do the small projects I just found it interesting that people would come out and claim that they were some amazing director or writer because I just knew it wasn't true yeah so I was happy to start right at the bottom and I didn't know where that would be but I knew I wanted to work with people that were actually working in the industry at the top of their game rather rather than saying claiming I'm a director and and working on short films for the next five years you went to school in Australia yeah Sydney Sydney education system and in college is a little bit different in Australia than than America yeah I think so so I lived I still lived at home when I went to college or at universities what we call it so I think the experience is quite different my course was very easy I was only there three days a week on a job and yeah it was simple work the rest of the time and it's filmed it was filmed yeah so I was a Bachelor of Communications and Majid in Film so we had a lot of boring subjects about learning the history of not film but all I don't know random boring stuff did you like film theory yeah what did all the other red means yeah and watched random films about what was the point of that you just wasted two hours of my life yeah yeah I pretty sure this is never again I come up on set yeah I can do that at home if I wanted yeah like where are we watching movies and yeah when do we just get to make the films yeah that's all we wanted to do did you do any of that like that yeah yeah yeah yeah it was really cool we did one subject we were actually the last year that did it we worked with 16 mil films so that was really cool shooting it and then having to wait until the following week to get out results back from what we actually shot and being like whoa we made some mistakes there yeah some films were completely just washed out or had big grain marks through them and so that was good to learn from that yeah exactly yeah that's what I found actually you know while editing I do enjoy editing I think there's kind of a and I like the balance of both if I was just a full-time editor like you I like I would just kill myself I'm like I can't just sit in a dark room all day for eight to ten hours a day having no contact with other people some people love it some people love yeah exactly like if that's what you love go for it I do like the balance but doing the editing similar to that it kind of helps you to understand what you actually need when you're shooting so like if I'm doing some corporate stuff or shooting an event or even shooting a documentary and like they're saying I'm editing somebody else's footage or I'm editing my own footage I'm like why didn't I hold that shot for like an extra five seconds or an extra 10 seconds and then by being having your foot in a little bit of everything you kind of appreciate and understand what the other person should be actually going for actually talk about that in the book if people are saying they want to become a director having a good understanding of editing and even spending some time as a junior editor or however they can to to learn what coverage you need and what coverage you don't yeah because when you're under pressure on sat and everybody's looking to you do you want that shot or not you're going to need to know whether it's going to hit the cutting room floor or whether it's going to make make the scene yeah I love this I was just talking to my buddy yesterday who shot his first comedy central pilot and like it's funny because the stakes are so high it's it's easier when it's a small crew when you're just doing it by yourself and you just got a couple friends that are out there shooting it like you could shoot all day you could shoot 14 hours 16 hours it doesn't matter oh we'll get the shot tomorrow yeah you can not do that on a big budget set where overtime what is like one hour of overtime cost it's like and it's massive right yeah so the stakes are really high and I think that in in a way it's exciting at the same time stressful and I imagine the more you do it the better you get at it yeah exactly practice makes perfect and you get confident in your decisions and at the end of the day the director and the producer are leading a company of 500 people sometimes on set plus your act is in your extras so it's a huge group of people that you're in charge of and everybody's looking at you for directions so you've got to be confident in that role sure you go through college did you get any jobs then it was there anything now I was just working I was working at a surf shop selling clothes the take ends meet you serve in your spare time yeah that's great I want to learn how to surf that's a movement to LA in a couple months like that's my one thing I want to try to do you have any tips for beginner surfers like what just keep doing it just keep doing yeah and you're a fit guy so that's good you've got some off of body strength yeah that that's half the struggle is just getting paddling paddling surprise how much paddling you think it's probably pretty endurance based right yeah once yeah to to depends how big the surface if it's small it's okay but if it's bigger than you expect just paddling out and getting out the back where you can just sit and chill for a little while do I need a full body suit one of those wet suits is that if not if now we're coming into summer you should be fine okay is that that's just for the cold so yeah yeah yeah all right cool I'm trying to get a tan I'm in LA you know exact that you told you all right so you were working at the shop and then yeah so I wasn't working in film at all yeah the very last subject I did was work experience I think American colleges do it a lot better I see that you have a lot of internships and people do two months or six months at a time at these various production houses and stuff throughout their degree which is fantastic because that's how they get first-hand experience we didn't have that so much we just made short films and practice techniques and that kind of stuff so my last subject did some work experience on a channel 9 drama which is like a just a TV station was called Rescue Special Ops which was really fun because it was about a team of rescue guys that went to car crashes and cut people out or absail down cliffs to rescue so it's like real stuff no no no it's all drama it was all scripted so it was all about the love stories and the relationships that were going on and all that kind of boring stuff but what we got to do each day was really cool because we're absailing we're out in the country we're yeah all kinds of different places or I remember one day we got to blow up a service station like a gas station like legit yeah yeah this is like your original passions of lighting should on fire coming into your actual work life I should have become a special effects yeah that would have been cool um that was cool I spent two weeks with them and got put with the assistant directors just by chance I thought I was going to be in the locations department I arrived first and I'm like oh you'll be bored with us we're almost finished because they'll halfway through the third season the locations manager drove me straight to set and said here go with the assistant directors they always seem pretty busy and I'll have some fun stuff for you to do so spent two weeks of them and following that actually got offered a job pretty soon after on that that same show so it was really by chance that you got into assistant directing and it was kind of three there and yeah I was still saying I'm not sure what I want to do I don't I don't think I understand a big film set well enough to decide and say this is what I wanted to so so explain a little bit about what what assistant director does sure so you've got the first assistant director who's the boss of the set so they manage the set for the director they take as much pressure off the director as possible they kind of they'd be like the hard ass where they the director would be nice and then this guy comes in and then yeah to an extent they're working as a team sure and there's there's the producer there as well but the first day is responsible to keep the the film on schedule on track they make the schedule to begin with so they know exactly what shots and what scenes are being shot and what days and where we're going and that kind of stuff so they just keep everybody in line on set and then you've got a second assistant director who's predominantly offset they're planning for the next day with the call sheet and also getting everybody through hair makeup costume and all that kind of stuff so they're there slightly offset and a bit different and then in America you call it a second second assistant director in Australia we call it a third assistant director and then kind of the right-hand man for old woman for the first assistant director okay and part of my role has been directing all the extras so that's always fun when you have a big crowd saying and keeping everybody in line and yeah I always wonder that it's like whenever you look at the big crowd you're like this is somebody that like has worked on small sets but not the big stuff and you're just like every single person in the shot is like this is not just a random person walking by like everything is core and everything is choreographed pretty tightly so to an extent it's kind of hard when you've got 500 people and it just turns into chaos right there were some big scenes on parts of the carabin which just got released and one of one of the days we had I think was 600 extras 50 and it was just mental so we had a cannon that was firing we had explosions that were happening all kinds of things going on and trying to keep a handle on 600 people so you have a monitor are you kind of like just looking are you and then I've seen some old shots in behind the scenes of I forget just like an old school film where the extras had numbers yeah and then they you guys still do that where like people have numbers and you yell at them like hey I try to get to know names I find numbers are a little bit impersonal sure maybe I can remember a number you can remember a name yeah and often after working for years you get to know the extras quite well okay so maybe the industry smaller in Sydney and the Gold Coast in Australia but you get to know who these people are and you can rely on and who to avoid and that kind of stuff have you seen extras yeah that's so good it's amazing it's literally my life some days really yeah that's so funny I got to watch that it's been a while yeah but one thing we do do with the numbers so every extra does have a number and I take photos and we map out so say it's a scene that we're shooting today and tomorrow or sometimes it's today and then in four weeks time at a different location on the stage if you're at a location and map out right exactly where they are so when you come back to it because I can't remember that yeah we can pull it up and go okay you're standing there you were standing there we didn't use you and all that kind of stuff so okay yeah because you can't have an extra in a prominent place and have them in another prominent place in the other scene that somebody might see me wait a minute and we shoot out so out of order it's like we may shoot something on day one and then we come back to it on day 60 and if you've got photos you can be like wait a second you can't be here you died in the film 20 days ago things like that like we had that in my eye so it's like because there was three distinct battles that we talked about we killed a lot of people in the first battle and so we had to track whether people were still a lot of them and there's a certain amount of cheating you can get away with because everybody looked like an American soldier really sure but if it's like a prominent death if it's one of those deaths where you're like in saving private Ryan we're doing a shot in the head yeah all the the stunts he's particularly we had to track that because they would be front and center doing an explosion or getting shot or having some squibs exploding on them so yeah we just had to be careful that's cool is that what you've done I'm pretty much every of these big shoots is the that yeah when I started out I wasn't so much I was more just on set PA and that's kind of your responsible for making sure the cast are in the right place and locking down areas and just doing all the minor jobs but yeah as the years of progress did you have somebody to help you that like yeah yeah it wasn't me and 600 extras on that day like I'm also reporting to the first day day who's talking to the second second and then I was the third on that show and then on that day we probably had 15 ideas helping with that amount of I just don't I mean really in a lot of ways it's like it's a it's a business it's corporation it's like there's a hierarchy in terms of how companies are structured in the same way that film is but although with film is it always the same cruise or a lot of the cruise overlap with each other or is it like make show up and it's totally different no I'd say particularly on films in Australia because there's only so many big projects going on at the same time I would often work with the same people it would probably be 67% of the same crew and some people might have gone on a holiday so they're not doing that project and people come and go and all that kind of stuff but yeah I got to know them really well like they were my film family how do you then continue along to that it seems like a big jump from working on channel 9 to working on Mad Max that's a huge it's it's all doing the same thing it's just the scale of it gets smaller and bigger depending on what it is same problems but just yeah exactly and the big of the film is the more help you have so it's kind of there's a little bit less pressure and you have more time as well you're schedules more part of the out you're only shooting couple of minutes a day whereas on rescue we're shooting up to 10 minutes a day so I was just frantic all day long not knowing what I was doing because it was my first job and it's a lot 10 minutes a day holy shit how many episodes did they shoot we did 22 episodes in that series that's crazy yeah it was mental and like I just got through in the deep and and I didn't know what I was doing the crew really looked after me and they really they tested me and I work with some of the people still that I did that first job with and like yeah you get better at this now really that's 60 years later I hope I was yeah so you have some people that kind of took you under their wings yeah you always need that you need people that are going to teach you because it's the only way that I think you learn in the film industry make mistakes and people show you what you should have done and also just watching people and what they do so yeah I think there's a there's a balance for me from an entrepreneurial entrepreneurial aspect of starting my own business it was I had my sister who was a mentor to me she did she was a graphic designer ran her own business and then it's like if I would get into situations where I didn't know what to do with a client I didn't know how to chart like he asked me for a price I don't know what to chart for this there's like a thousand different questions that come up of course of like your first couple years of of doing something like that then also books as well were kind of my like books like this books yeah a lot of Seth go to books a lot of books that just get you in the right mindset because it can be lonely sometimes you can feel like you're you're kind of in this by yourself and I imagine so you have people above you that are helping you out but at the same time there aren't always people at your level that are doing the same thing where you can kind of be like hey man this is kind of tough like I did because there's a lot to get your head around in the first day yeah exactly so after Channel 9 we're to go from there so I finished that show and I really hit nothing I was like okay everybody else went and continued on and got the next job I I missed out on the next drama because I was inexperienced they hired somebody that was experienced and they took the role that I would be doing so I remember not knowing what to do ended up being a couple of months and I did a couple of commercials and bits and pieces here in there or additional days on certain shows but I wasn't sure what to do to be honest and then randomly out of the blue your phone just rings and so okay we've got this show do you want to come an interview for it or they might offer you the job there and then because they know who you are who you work with so ended up doing two short stance on some smaller Australian films as the runner which is like a production assistant based in the office a lot of driving picking up things very minimal just random tasks and then out of that while I was waiting I got offered the great Gatsby with a couple of the people that I'd worked with previously and so that just blew my mind yeah that was a big comment and have an interview because you always hear rumors and whispers of what films coming up so who do you know on it how do I get an in who do I email yeah and you're trying to get that inside knowledge and it just popped up out of nowhere and I went into an for an interview and I can't remember if they offered me it there might have been a few days later and I started probably a week later wow with the film already underway no so that are in pre-production I think I did about six weeks of pre-production which is really good because it allowed me to get to know a lot of people instead of just day one on set like all the pressures on you already so I remember setting up the office for the assistant directors and and reading the script and getting to know what he was really so you did you know when you went into the interview how big this film actually was did I don't know if there was much talk about it I knew how big it was I knew it was a big film that was shooting in Sydney but I didn't understand what a basloom and film is like because everything's just over the top and amazing yeah fun and crazy that's crazy and really hard work a cool story that I'll tell you from it was either day two or day three I was just the random guy that whatever job they needed done I would just get thrown in there it's like push this TV from here to there or go and set this off the sun I just get the random jobs and we were it was shot all in three days so um basloom never shot in three days for a feature before so it was something new for him so we did a lot of camera tests day three on there and they're like um we need somebody to do the acting for the three day test and it wasn't acting it was literally just like pick this up pick that up move here come and hit this mark wait there look over here there was no lines or anything yeah um and they're like map do that so day three on there being directed by basloom this camera test testing three day camera rigs that most of the crew had never used before yeah and I was just like wow I just went home going that was an amazing experience that's fucking so cool yeah that was cool I had a this is like a lower level so this is like my like lower level version of that so I did a lot of work early on with the music videos with this company called robot films they did a lot of hip-hop music videos and uh we're at this like overnight shoot and it's a party scene and then there this is this one scene and I'm like I guess you could call me I was just like almost like an assistant slash I was shooting some behind the scenes footage as well as kind of just getting a feel for it I was almost like an apprentice of this company because like I was connected with the owner and the director and then um I was trying to help them they were shooting a silhouette scene where there's like a sexy woman like dancing with this guy and then um they with the guy like basically they didn't look right they were right next to each other but for some reason the silhouette looked different so we needed the guy to come forward a little bit a little bit away from the girl and then uh I kept trying to like absolutely helping them tweaking and like you know Matt why don't you just get in there why don't you why don't you be the guy in the silhouette which I probably had this like mushroom haircut like you probably showed up in the in the the silhouette and then it was the most awkward thing ever like I'm I'm in college and I'm like kind of dorky and and um not confident at all and here's this like the lump she was woman who's like half naked and she's like touching my face and she's like getting real seductive with me and no and I'm like we both were like this is the most awkward thing that we've ever been through um but that was uh that was similar it wasn't I don't think it was on the scale so intimidating yeah as would be like Matt moved these books from there to there I remember it was all about books I was about to be McGuire's scene where he unpacks his house next to Gatsby's mansion and Bazz is giving me a direction I'm like this is a kind of terrifying like like now do it quicker I'm like doing exactly the same I'm like I'm not an actor you just intimidated by this entire thing you know without you give actors a lot more credit for what they do yeah like holy fuck I can't do that that's that's like to to be able to it's not just expressing the right emotion but it's doing it under the context where if you fuck you're costing us money yeah um and being confident yeah they need to be so confident in front of the entire crew because the crews are standing there going hurry up I want to go home right now 15th hour you're taking too many takes yeah yeah you need to turn it on there and then they gotta get it especially if it's like it's seen where it's emotional or I think you know that's that's where it gets kind of crazy um that's such a cool story though and then Cree Gatsby how long does that show run for I think that was about eight months I spent on that six to eight months um it was incredible like every day was incredible I wasn't waking up dreading going to work at all but that's all I did was go to work for eight months so that's tough for the personal life yeah so I was newly married my wife and I got married very very young um so this was the first big job of my career and she was extremely supportive like gym was amazing through that I remember I would wake up brush my teeth go to work well have a shower brush my teeth go to work come home have a shower brush my teeth go to sleep that's all I did because I was just exhausted every meal you know they're long they're long days when you have two hours it's just because you get so sweaty yeah 15 hours a day yeah yeah but at the same time the energy the bads brings to set and what we were creating was just phenomenal and so cool that's why I wouldn't become so important right to have leaders that are exactly and he doesn't just boss people around he inspires you to be a part of making his film which is so cool yeah so how does he do that he brings you on he sells the vision to so he's the only director that I've met that actually sat down with his crew of that was probably two to three hundred people I remember on the sound stage and he played us a ten minute rough cut of what he wanted the film to be with all different visual elements that he'd thrown together some rough visual effects mockups or storyboards and all kinds of stuff and the soundtrack the music and he shows you exactly what he wants the film to be and so you become a part of it rather than just there's the script read it we'll go and make it right that's so important because I will do that oftentimes especially if it's small stuff I try to infuse a little bit of that but I think that's like a reminder to to make people a part of it to let them know why we're shooting these interviews not to just show up and hit record because that like people need to feel like they actually are excited about the project yeah and a lot of times especially when you're working on small budget stuff you have to inspire people beyond money like a couple hundred dollars for a day if it's small project is like nobody's going to be excited about that but can you get some big excited about the vision of what you can potentially create together I imagine working on a project that big that early in your career gives you a lot of street cred and a lot of it allows you to kind of move to another big project it's like you've gotten legitimate experience now yeah and I think it came down to who I worked with but it wasn't people weren't then looking at my resume being like oh wow he worked on the great Gatsby he must be amazing they look at who you worked with so I continued to work with the same assistant directors for the next well six years until I moved over here so you you did well in your role so they they keep you on yeah exactly so as long as you can do the well you can do the job well and you sharp on time and you're easy to work with whatever you've learnt in that six months like you become so close to people you know exactly what they need like I know when I walk into work in that morning how to get my boss going how to make their coffee the best coffee went to get them breakfast went to not talk to them because they're in their own headspace and just judging that person and having that relationship so the next film they take you on to you've already established that so yeah it's even smoother not everybody's good at that though I think it does require like reading people and having some social wit and not yeah and and look some people won't get along with some people and they might both be really good at their job but their personalities just clash so they won't want to do other jobs with each other what advice would you give somebody that's that's kind of going down that route of just starting one of these gigs for the first time they're on set for the very first time work hard and go the extra mile so how do you do that? it starts by showing up early so if I know my call time is six o'clock I'll get there five thirty maybe five forty five but yeah at least 15 minutes before so I can come in I can put my bag down I put my radio on I read the call sheet I read the sides if I need to which about little script sides for what are shooting that day and so I'm prepared so it's six o'clock when I need to be on or even before that I'm ready to go to work and I know exactly what what is going on rather than somebody that walks in at six o'clock puts their bag down and is still a massive six o'clock and not knowing what they're doing so that's the first thing just starting your day early and getting on top and also prepping the people above you it's all about hierarchy in the film industry so it's like I know who is directly my supervisor so I need to make sure they're set up for their day of work and I need to make sure the next boss and the next boss is all set up so it's like if I've got that extra 15 minutes I make sure either their desk is tidy if you're offset or going on to set making sure they've got everything they need for me it's the stand-ins having them there straight away and prepped on the day and knowing what we're going to start with make sure everybody's have breakfast and coffee like food and coffee is it's all about that when you start in the film industry it's all about the food that I do make it sure the crew's fed a hundred percent yeah because we work long days and I get hungry very quickly yeah I think everybody does right but that that's amazing advice I think nobody has ever gotten in trouble for showing up early and I think that's good advice for like anybody any role you're going to be in show up early and just be prepared and ready to go and especially like we're talking about in these big film roles it starts at the beginning of the day because if you show up late if you don't have the you know what you call the fillings or the stand-ins if you don't have the stand-ins ready to go then it's going to slow everything else down every busy me waiting on you and then if if if a lot of people are behind a little bit it probably pushes everything back and then if you you know if it really sometimes is a matter of like probably five to ten minutes on some of these shoots where you're like we just need five minutes to get this one last scene but we can't do it because we're going to over time and then we're going to go over budget and then we're not going to be able to do it have you ever had a with these big budget things I was just talking about my buddy uh with the pilot and he said they had the cut scenes they had the cut a couple scenes because they were like we don't have time for it we can't do it it's going to be able to budget does that happen with the big big stuff or do they generally they make everything work it's above my pay grade to be honest yeah like I see script amendments happen and I know when we've dropped scenes off days and whether we pick that up or not but that's really for the producer the director and the first idea to I don't have any you don't know why they might be cut off why sometimes I know sometimes we're just shooting too slowly or might have rained on us all day long and that kind of stuff like changing the script like life minutes yeah or deciding well we don't really need that scene but the director might fight for it so it was swaps and days of the schedule and the schedule constantly changes but yeah it's forever being tweaked and adjusted and depends on the writer and the director relationship as well like there's rights a lot of his own staff so amendments would come out almost daily but let's say weekly but that's a lot of amendments but then you can work on something else where the writer is the writer and the director is the director so it's pretty sad and concrete what they're doing and it's like you just have to capture those scenes on the day yeah and I think a big part of it is like you have problems that that arise right and then it's just trying to figure out the quickest most of the problems right what they believe what happens yeah you can't even on a small scale you can't have a shoot where one thing but everything goes right there's always at least one thing and it's usually multiple things like wrong and you're always generally weather yeah happens to weather dealt with weather in all kinds of stuff I've like mopped mud off a muddy ground just to make it look dry really just some of the stuff you find yourself doing to overcome these obstacles it's just ridiculous like who mopped mud and then throw sand on it for one take and then has to do it all over again rather than just go oh it's raining we'll give up and go back to you just don't have the time a little more to do that yeah um do you ever did you ever find yourself early on and even now doing things that were outside of the scope of your role that you shouldn't have been doing where sometimes as I've gone from being a one man running gun do everything audio video interviews like do it all to get into a point where you have I have a crew usually with the doc stuff like five or six seven people knowing that wait like I shouldn't be slating in this interview because I'm directing this like you ever get to a point like that yeah sometimes you've definitely got to know on the larger films where there's people to do everything there's people to hand you food there's people to pick up that shot bag you you leave it to them it's like I don't come and wipe the windscreen of a car because either the vehicles department or the props department do that and I'm doing that job if I do that yeah some people get a little bit funny about that you know that they're really cross sorry I have the camera department you can't touch a camera exactly there's certain things where on some days if somebody's struggling you're going to help them lift up their cases or push their trolley or that kind of stuff but you know what your role is I do remember early on my career I got into trouble by a bus because I made a phone call to somebody that I wasn't supposed to speak to just because they are up the top of the chain and I was right down the bottom and I thought I was helping trying to set a meeting up but apparently it said in a course of events that I wasn't supposed to be a part of oh really it's like I just got told where my place was which wasn't a negative thing I didn't get yelled at or anything she's just said make sure you come through me every time you're going to do something like that so that was just a learning curve what was the next film after got to be so I took a little bit of a holiday after Gatsby which is nice yeah yeah you think a honeymoon well we actually we did six weeks around Europe so that was pretty good oh that's great gem got the reward for me working and being away for so long oh that's nice and then went straight on to Mad Max which was really cool and that was still in pre-production quite early pre-production based in Sydney and now we're about to film in the Cape Town in South Africa so it was a different role for me it was office based rather than on set so that was good saying the other parts of it all get made and then the crew flew over to Africa and I continued to work in the office as like logistical support so I very it was a very random role for me it wasn't really putting into practice what I'd learnt from Gatsby but I was seeing a whole other side of things it was actually a really crazy job which was nice just have a little bit of a break and and say Jen a little bit more and back on us it can be tough it's a balance yeah that's what it's all about and it's it's not like you can there's a recipe where you figured out and then all right now my life's good I have a perfect balance between my personal life work life relationships and so that's stuff it's like constantly it's always constantly out of balance and you're just trying to bring it back into it if you're working in film it's never nine to five you're going to work 20 hour days for six months and then you're going to have six months off it's like being a pilot in a lot of ways that's what they do they do they're going on three months off yeah yeah which is tough it can be hard on families and relationships and and friends something that you've got to be aware of going into it you're prepared to kind of give up social effort for a five month if that's a project or I've lived away from home for six months once doing a film that was out of state and yeah it's interesting it's a challenge and it's been great that Jen is so relaxed and encouraging of that and she can handle it I just told Nat recently because I decided to stop at least for the time being client work to focus on original projects because I just like while that's my real only source of income besides like minimalism like we get a little bit coming in here and there from that but I was like if I want to focus on creating original content on this podcast on doing all this stuff I cannot continue to do this so I'm like Nat just want you know you might have to be the bread with her for a little bit like you may have to pick up the slack because I'm not going to make it make it a lot of money over the next year because I want to like really you got to give yourself some time to be able to do that stuff and she's just been incredibly supportive but you need that you need to be able to have people that have you. It's about picking the right times if you just had young children you probably wouldn't go and put that pressure on your family yeah right now you can do it so yeah exactly it's kind of one project to the next that how usually is in the film industry and it's always that's always the scary thought because you can be coming up to finishing a project and you have nothing on the horizon and I remember like Jen and I bought a property back in Sydney almost three years ago now and it was scary because my work contracts could sometimes be eight weeks long and then I would have nothing after that but you've just got to trust that the next project comes around like we're always making TV shows and films so they'll be worked there you've just got to go out and get it so in the beginning for me it's like you have to say yes to pretty much everything I mean I think most people do is like if you don't have any experience you got to say yes to a lot but then eventually once you get going and you build up some experience you have to be more selective and especially when you're working on an eight month project six month project you can't just hop into the next film just for the money you know because if if you've got a project opportunity you take that you you're saying no to everything else for the next 68 months and sometimes projects will turn out to be completely different to what you expect so you might think you're doing it just for money because they offered you a promotion and better money or something like that and you just need it to pay bills this time but you might meet a director you get along really well with if you're up and coming deep in and up doing a project with them or you might work with somebody that takes you and does some other projects or all kinds of stuff or you might just make some good friends over that time so it's yeah it's interesting how some projects I've started them thinking I was either doing it for the promotion or that role and then it turns out to be something else was there any points where you felt like I'm that ready for this holy shit like every job seriously yeah like because you're constantly taking on more responsibility with each project so you're always feel out of your comfort zone and out of depth it's like I think probably after two years of working as a third assistant director I did a project and went wow actually feel comfortable in my role I feel like I'm actually having some good input on this film rather than just being frantic all day long and going home and like just getting as much sleep as possible and coming back the next day with the best attitude because again I didn't know what I was doing right you built up some confidence in in what you're doing yeah actually I'm bringing something to the table and then you start to mentor the people below you you might get given a pay on a on a job or a young camera assistant or something that you can give a few tips to or just kind of encourage because you can see that they're not getting enough sleep and they're emotional and broken you're like I've been there yeah exactly they might have a hard boss that's yelling at them for no apparent reason just to test who they are but you can be like dude it's okay oh he'll get through it's like a frat yeah kind of yeah some rates of passage I've forgotten what the question was it was pushing yourself out of your your comfort zone and I wonder if there is any specific things that come to mind in terms of either films or or specific scenes where it was like this is a part of the Caribbean was probably the scariest project for me one because it was out of state so I had to move an Alice flight away to the Gold Coast from Sydney and it was a long project or six months living away from home and I knew it was going to be a big project and just a challenge for what I was going to do and it was a great crew like I knew the crew really well and everybody supported each other and I actually ended up living in an apartment with the guy his name's Chris Turner he was who I got put with work experience on that very first job I did on rescue specialist and took his role so I've always worked together really well but that kind of solidified that relationship where we actually lived together for six months that's cool yeah and became really good buddies but that film scared me and initially when I heard it was getting mad I was like I don't want to move to the Gold Coast I don't want to do that project I'm comfortable in Sydney I'm happy here everybody also go away and I'll take their jobs in Sydney it'll be great sure and I spoke to a mentor of mine it doesn't work in film it just kind of helps me through various things professionally and he said just go and do it that's like why I don't want to it's like it'll be great for you just go and do it and so I called them back out and said hey I'll take that job and then there's a whole process to that you got to negotiate and nothing was sure until I actually got there really but he just pushed me that little bit even though I didn't want to do it and I never regretted it gen and I did find our relationship was fine we flew back and forth was an hour flight yeah it was an hour flight so I was sick of going to the airport we we'd do fortnight I'm going to say I didn't come up or I'd go down and yeah you well you're lucky it wasn't in the States because I've traveled between like Sydney and Melbourne and it did it's so easy yeah literally just like walk through it's like a bus terminal yeah but on your day off do you want to go to the airport and then have like I think it's 30 hours together and then go back to the airport it just still rough frustrating long distance is really tough especially if you have to fly it's like I've done long distance where you drive five hours but I think a flight is just like an added stress yeah but that was an amazing project I made strong friends actually had a good time on the Gold Coast too like we're living across the road from the beach it was amazing well that's good surf on days off and it was cool and then we got to do some amazing scenes I work with the most extras I've ever worked with they were stunts pretty much every day yeah it was really cool when did you decide to come to New York we've always talked about it especially the US we weren't sure about LA on New York probably five years now so pretty early on in our careers we're like let's go over to the US at some stage it always appealed to us yeah my wife works in advertising so there's bigger industries here we want to learn from bigger and bigger people people that have worked on the best projects and the best companies that kind of stuff it just took us a while to get here we actually won the green card lottery which was insane so what is the green card lottery I don't know so the certain countries around the world that can enter this lottery each year for free and they they say they just draw your name out of a hat pretty much and when your name comes up you've got about 12 months you get processed as a visa and you get a green card so we're on an unrestricted green card for 10 years and then we can really work yeah that's insane I didn't know that yeah that's amazing I didn't tell Natalie to submit to that yeah exactly so for people in the film industry that want to work in LA it's a great avenue it just takes time it took us four years of entering to actually oh you did okay but I've heard of people winning it in their first year I've heard of people second and third years it just took us a little while yeah that did well I mean I somebody who does something that that's more freelance that's like really important you both got it though at the same time so Jen wanted but because we're married yeah that's so cool yeah yes I have to like marry Natalie now to like so she can stay but even that is not like a we we're looking into a process yeah you like they give you I think like temporary for a year she can stay and then she has to go through the application process yeah it's a it's a long process this if your name comes up it's probably the easiest way to get into the you I'm gonna tell it yeah although it's since she's here I don't know if you can do it because she's on a visa she can still do it yeah she's sleeping on that I think you can hear it it's pretty and it's free to enter you've got nothing to lose really yeah what do you do you really do it yeah it's like dv diverse it's called the diversity green card or something like that it's just the website that you enter between october November and then you find out in May so the interesting thing was it always came out on the second of May I think or very early May and Jen's birthday the first of May so she'd have a really good birthday but she'd be like I wonder if I've got the green card this year and then it would come out and I'd be like I didn't get it did you guys lose your shirt when you found out there you go yeah it was pretty nuts yeah I checked my name first and I didn't get it well like oh here we go another year of disappointment and then we checked Jenny's and like her face was just like oh my god why do I do now like and she just started calling people I had to go to work so it's like moving where you were going on then I can't even remember I'm not sure so yeah so I'm not it was alien sorry I do yeah it was alien because I went to work I was like guys we're moving to the U.S we just won the green card and they're like what because they not only do you win that how exciting is it but then you're like well now we should we should probably move right yeah so it takes time we found out in May we got processed in October and then we moved in February we're following you exciting it's crazy because that's why I say you can't really make plans for the future like you can like a little bit and you can have an idea of where you want to go but at the same time you have no idea where you're going to be and then we had to decide between Los Angeles or New York where there are two options we could have gone anywhere but out of the two places we decided right if you're coming to the states you want to you're not you're coming to live in Montana yeah well Atlanta is another option for us because of the film industry there but I just didn't want to live there and I felt like them would just be moving for my work whereas New York was a happy median for both of us yeah good industries for both of us a crazy exciting city a big challenge so how do you like it so far it's been tough it's been hard it's a really really hard transition actually the original name of the podcast was going to be how to make it in New York because I just shouldn't be the name of my one yeah it's like how do you like like stay close just cross out New York Sydney and then yeah yeah yeah yeah well how to move to New York yeah well I think that's the thing is that you you can't really make it in New York and it's it's like I'm just befuddled at every time that I see people moving to New York and I'm like how were you doing it a lot of people are like living in with six people in Bushwake in a two bed apartment and that's the only way they can do it they're like because that's a big thing that a lot of people in New York they're like oh so what do you pay for rent what's your rent and everybody wants to know yeah where do you live what's your rent how much is your rent and I tell them they're like old you're paying way too much I'm like yeah but you live two hours out of the city like I live on Manhattan yeah now I don't so I was just talking to a real tear from LA and I was like I was putting touch with him from a friend and he's kind of given tell me a little bit about he's it what do you want what do you like what are your requirements like I gave him this this is our budget this is kind of what we're thinking about I said okay cool I'm going to send you over about 10 15 places and I was like wait wait wait wait wait wait like this is cost anything like do I have to pay you a fee or a real tear fee or anything like that I say no what are you talking about yeah I was like a New York you have to pay a real tear fee is like a real a broker's fee I was like yeah sometimes it's 10% of your yearly rent 10 to 15% it's so much money because rent is so high yeah and like for me I was lucky that it was just one month which is like 2500 bucks which is still a lot of money you're just that money's gone that's not something you get back but nothing you do yeah for nothing for absolutely nothing you you do that and then you have to pay an actual security deposit of 2500 first month last month that's like over 10 grand to move into a place it's crazy and then not only that but the fact that to I was like so do these places just go like that because you have to show up like with money to these places in order to get did you guys have a tough time finding a place in New York or was it that was actually one of the easiest thing which is phenomenal because that job and a house that's what you're scared of when you're moving like as far as you can sort out those two things you can do anything like you can find friends you can whatever but the house we locked in probably two months before we moved which I was so stoked about because it just took that pressure off us and it came out of nowhere it's a sub lease there's an amazing group on Facebook called the Australians in New York Australia and they carry each other oh yeah so it's incredible there's about 10,000 members in it and people post up places that are renting out sub leasing if somebody's moving out and they're breaking their lease trying to get new tenants or that kind of stuff but it's more than that as well it's not just housing it's recommendations for places to eat it's jobs are getting advertised Jen's phone got stolen on the weekend which was Obama and she post on the haze anybody having an old iPhone that I can either borrow or have for a little while just until I can figure out what's going on and it immediately people like yeah you can have this iPhone you can have that iPhone come and pick it up so she picked up an iPhone like that day and they're like yeah whatever I don't need it you can have it so that's amazing yeah it's this amazing community just helps each other out that's great and yeah that's actually probably how Natalie got her first apartment and an affordable apartment at that she was subletting for like 900 subucks a month which is like really hard to get a place for like around 900 dollars for one person she was living with roommates but that that kind of community it's nice to have that when you go over because you do in a way even though you may not know these people personally you know that you can fall back on that yeah exactly if you need help or advice and at the same time like if people are asking questions about the green card lottery like Jen or I are trying to answer those questions and help people out so yeah it comes full circle but yeah we ended up with this awesome one bedroom place in West Village um amazing little neighborhood it's amazing Jen's dream street to live on to begin with so I'm like well we're living in Manhattan in your dream street to start with like that's pretty cool yeah isn't it weird to think that like just one day you're in city the next day you're living in Manhattan and it's kind of like surreal right and it was like going from summer to winter we lived on the beach to the middle of the city you've never dealt with winter before well it doesn't snow not like a real winter yeah it's like it's cold but yeah not like this I remember Natalie's first winter it was January and she's like all right well you know at least it's gonna be warm next month and like maybe like April May like May June even though we started June and I'm still waiting for the warm weather this is the summer and then then it's gonna get so hot that you're gonna be like I'm done with this yet it gets too hot yeah people like start passing out from from heat exhaustion yeah it's the that's what I'm actually looking forward to with L.A. it's more of like Sydney type weather which will be nice yeah um you guys do yourself in New York for for a bit longer yeah you know how long you are I think it's very early to say it's been what six months there's a four months yeah so we're still still figuring that out we definitely like it it's just a massive challenge so um and the next step for us will be children at some stage in the next few years in New York well that's a big question isn't it don't do it can we don't do it do that can we do that without the family support yeah we do that really tough yeah to me my the one reason why I would never do that is just watching the people struggling struggling with strollers in the subway and like pulling it upstairs and I'm like never never I can't do it when it's fine and sunny outside it's it's easy but when it's snowing outside or when it's raining and yeah we're gonna do it people do it people do it exactly so I don't know that's a reason to do it though right if there's a reason for us to stay we'll do it yeah some of this if either of us is doing really well in our jobs or we feel like we can't move then then we'll do it but come to LA I'm now I'm trying to not that I'm moving to LA I'm trying to get everybody one of those already yeah yeah yeah I'm even moved there yeah yeah come LA it's so much better the weather is tight yeah great traffic if I were weather in the beach I'll just go home to see go home to Sydney yeah that's pretty much it isn't it I um well that's actually one of the reasons we're moving to LA is that it's closer to Sydney is that and even though it's a 14 hour flight that having done the 25 to 27 hour flight is like oh there's not bad yeah it's okay it's it's direct flight so we'll see how it works out it'll be nice to to be able to do a lot of Australians do go through LA as well it's it's very much visited by Australians is it yeah I imagine it would be yeah you guys go a lot of Australians go to London as well yeah that's I think Australians just go everywhere around the world it's not to escape Australians I don't know if it's because myself isolated that everybody's like well I want to get out so I've got to go somewhere it doesn't matter how far it is or I don't know what it is but yeah London but even I was in Whistler in the winter and that place is just overrun by Australians I swear Canada okay yeah so I was skiing in Canada yeah it's just Australians ever maybe it's because here's the thing that I never met I only knew a couple Australians like I've only met a couple Australians and a new one guy from an old job but Natalie was like one of the first Australians that I met so I think when you are on Australian kind of like you like stick to the community you tend to to to find each other but then once that community is open up I'm like they're fucking everywhere but now that I go we've got the dinner and it's like 10 other Australians and I'm the only American there I'm like fuck and you might not notice it but I'll walk down the street and I'll hear Australian stalking because I just recognize that accent that's true immediately I'm like I kind of skate things yeah yeah yeah what who are all these people yeah yeah I tend to notice it I pick up on it a little bit more now but even in LA you'll have so many people so many actors trying to make it there so really makers yes yeah probably more Australians in LA I would imagine that in New York just because of the proximity so I could probably use your transition for them but uh yeah I feel like did you take a year off did you do that what is it called the the leap year or the gap year gap year did you do that I did yeah so that's when I went to Colorado and spent six months skiing and being an idiot having no responsibilities yeah which I was that a gen no no that was with two bodies from school which was an amazing trip and I still look back at photos and go how did we not die really just the dumb stuff we did just the jumps that we did and launching off cliffs on our snowboards and super dangerous yeah just do you still do stuff like that no that's that's why I was in whistler looking at stuff that 10 years ago would happily do that job or launch off that cliff and now I'm looking out of go kind of crazy person does that like we're just soft now all I think and I think it's responsibility so I look at that job and go I can break my leg I can break my neck I won't be able to work then I can't play my mortgage then Jenny will probably leave me because I'll just be done that lying in bed doing something like when you were younger you would look at that and you would see the potential yeah yeah yeah I can do that if you can do it I can do it let's do it and then now you now you see your wife leaving you when you look at that I just look at responsibilities yeah it's so true man I feel the same exact way it's like I'm I'm I'm very cautious about about hurting myself like Ari is my health insurance gonna be able to to pay for this like if I if I don't work for the next three to six months I'm I gonna be like yeah it's not gonna leave you just hold you back but it's probably a good thing because jumping off cliffs on snowboards isn't the smartest thing it's not sustainable I don't think and if you're not gonna fight it was fun yeah it's fun I'm so happy about it and I became such a good friend for those guys from school and yeah we just ran a mock you were 18 like in Sydney you can drink and you're considered an adult at 18 but in America 21 so we're just these young kids that thought we own the world but yeah they were just they we do have that culture here but it seems to be more prevalent in you know Australia it's probably yeah it's probably because most Australians are from the east coast as well so you've got yeah you don't have everybody's from Brisbane Sydney or Melbourne really so we'll grown up with beaches and mountains and outdoor activities so yeah yeah so getting reestablished in New York has been a challenge yeah what's like the the toughest part about it I mean for four four months is not a very long time I think you're gonna stop it so I haven't given up just yet I like I like that there's still an option there to give up yeah I worked on a pilot here for a couple of weeks a few weeks I worked with the producer for a little while but it just comes down to your network I always knew that I got jobs from people that I knew I never submitted my resume to third assistant director for pirates of the Caribbean like they don't advertise those jobs so it's about building up those networks and people trusting you to give you that job again so that's been the biggest challenge just getting to know as many people as possible that are working in the film industry are there many Australians say in that that Facebook group that are in the film industry or is it yeah there's a few and I've connected with a few buzzers actually based in now so I've met with his business people and his production company people which is cool and they're kind of introduced you to some American people that are working here and that kind of stuff and I think it just it'll take time and I probably forget that although I got Gatsby fairly early on it was still August so it was almost was about 10 months by the time I finished university and started on that job to actually getting a first big job that I was stoked with as much as I was happy with the TV show and the small films like it took still took a while to get established so four months isn't that long yeah and that all that all the takes is just to get that one game in your work to stab the right person and then you're in so yeah and then it's so you said you're you're you're starting to you want to get into producing a little bit more so that's the goal that's always been my aim for the last few years assistant directing is fun and amazing and we've been to some awesome locations and worked with some of the best filmmakers in the world which was really cool but I've always wanted to produce I love crafting stories I love running a film as a business and like a little startup like I'm an entrepreneur at my core so that's that's what I enjoy doing and that's what I want to pursue more and more while I'm in New York so would you ever get into directing or do you think I don't really have an interest in it yeah which is funny to say because people go but you're an assistant director but it's a very different mindset and I don't I don't get really excited by directing performance but you right well is this a different kind of writing for you than that's very different yeah it's and also I write it and then Jen edits it oh Jen so if you read my book you'd be born oh that's amazing but if you read my book through the eyes of Jenny's rewrites then it's good dude that that's a true partnership right there yeah exactly so but how do you motivate your wife to edit your book when she doesn't want to that's that was the hardest how did you do that you should write a whole book on that just takes time so everything takes longer than you expect so took about 18 months to to write that and actually started while I was on the Gold Coast lonely on pirates just with time I was like oh what should I do and I was constantly training but yeah I was constantly training production assistants and people that were starting out or would get work experience kids or what kinds of different things I was just like I started writing it into I thought would probably be a blog or just some emails that I could send to people when they started out and I don't know I just kept going and kept getting bigger and bigger and bigger and yeah also that mentor that I spoke of that told me to go and do that job he's then to Glenn when we're chatting one day I was like oh which somebody told me at age 25 to just write some books because he's now I think he's got three books that he's really well I was like oh that's a good challenge from him I think I was I was probably 25 26 at the time so I was like all right I'll start a book this is not easy to read a book no especially when you're juggling up with full-time work but they kind of complimented each other because I'd have the experience on set and then I could come home and write two pages about it that night because it was fresh in my mind and I knew exactly what to think about it and write a lot of material yeah going to work will give me the material I get the back there's a glossary with I don't know a couple hundred different terms that we use and somebody would say something I'd be like oh and I write it in my phone to remind me to go home and write that term in the glossary at the end of the day so people can look it up and go what the heck does this this is like a central for for filmmakers because that terminology you got to know yeah exactly somebody this is somebody somebody once we were doing like a really small budget thing and somebody told like a PA was his first job ever told him to go fill the meter and he's like fill the meter what the hell does fill the meter mean and then he just walked away and like without asking him I didn't know what to do but the guy was just saying filled a meter filled like that the parking mirror it wasn't like some code for like a idiot asking so you have just be like yeah copy that and walk off and hope that it doesn't get noticed yeah dirty but there's still so many things that pop out like that that doesn't have every single film term in there well I like that you have Koshit Kali that's definitely Australian version of it isn't it well I would say that on this pilot that I did in New York I would say I'm taking the call is to set and the second AD would look at me and be like what did you just say I'm like yeah the call is I'm taking them to set they're printed they're ready to go she'd be like it's a call sheet I'm like yeah the call is you calling I like calling veteran yeah so there's probably some Australian turns in there that people are like that no that doesn't fly in the US but there's a bit of overlap and very staying so who did the illustrations which one are you on that if you were to figure out there's an AD there's very no that's a director yeah the director the producer with his briefcase of money that's amazing guy like with his guy out oh I think this is all like who drew this so there's an illustrator called Alan Raff he's a friend of mine who now lives in New Zealand he's and he does these amazing illustrations like that I just loved his work and asked him to do one for me and then sent him photos and descriptions of all these different characters and he sketched some stuff up and then we worked on it made some adjustments and stuff you've probably imagined gotten a lot of people reaching out to you about the book like I guess what's the most commonly asked questions that people may ask you or about the book yeah or just about your career in film just what to do on set because it's so hard to get that real world experience it's so hard to get that in because it's such a competitive industry to begin with so you might get plucked out one out of a hundred to go and be the work experience person on a certain shoot or a film or whatever but to get that that real world advice where it's just simple it's like do this and people will like you don't do this because you won't get the next job like that's what it is like it's just tips to get to work early make your boss a coffee like real simple stuff but unless somebody tells you directly that's what you got to do then it might take six months or a year to be good at your job and by that time your opportunity might have passed like yeah it's such a brutal industry sometimes if somebody's not good in my team in the first couple of days like it just takes too much time to train them into what you want them to be but hopefully somebody can read this and show up on day one and be a little bit better than what they were going to be and give them a chance to actually make it through and continue to work yeah I could I the first impression is so important yeah and if it's your first shoot ever if it's your first big production like yeah you really want to bring it you want to put your best foot forward yeah and some people will naturally have that they might be older in life they might have worked a bunch of jobs they might have been an assistant to somebody so they know exactly what to expect but somebody might have come straight out of school they might never work to job in their life they might have been a sports star that trained as a sports star all their life and now they've finished college didn't quite make it and are starting out in the film industry and it's like going work really hard on a film set and they're like I don't know what to do so they that first day they appear really shy but in the eyes of everybody else they're just useless because they're not confident in what they do yeah dude I had that like I've talked about this before but like I did I point on one big shoot was like 3040 people was a GE commercial spot it was actually like an online spot but it was like a nice nice decent sized crew there for two days and I was the DP and like I want to see like Wikipedia and Google what is the DP? Kate lot yeah yeah because it's like because now I have to it is it's it's easier to work on small crews in terms and it's easier to direct when you don't have to direct anybody when you're only directing your own mind and sometimes that's why it's easy if I'm editing my own project I directed it takes another set of skills to be able to communicate your vision to somebody else it's a little bit easier to say brain to edit okay this is what I'm and I can kind of change things up on the fly and figure it out but then to to go to the set I have to actually be able to I didn't know any of this lingo I didn't know any of these these words to communicate my vision I didn't even have a vision really my big thing was and like as as a DP I think people give you a little bit of credit and a lot of credit and they they're not like doubting you but so I was just pretty quiet on set and I would ask the gaffer like I'd be like hey so what do you think about this set I would say that for everything I would ask him hey what do you think we should do here and like it was clear that he like I don't know if it was clear but for me at least it was obvious I had no idea what I was doing I had never seen like that but like luckily enough they were incredible and like this guy had done a lot of DP work as well so they just kind of set everything up but I swear to god all I did was I pushed the chord like I that's all I did as the DP like we would just set up these scenes I would push the dialy I would hit record push the dialy and cut and I pushed record again and I was it but it's it's incredibly overwhelming I think for a shoot like that and that can be intimidating for the same myself sometimes I'll produce a commercial with a production company called Mint Films that I used to work with a lot in Sydney free plug to them and if I'm the producer like I'm in my mid 20s and I would have people working for us that were in their 40s and 50s they would have 20 years more experience to me but they'd be like what are we doing next map or we've got this issue how are you going to sort it out or even just where's lunch or what's the catering and that kind of stuff I was responsible to these people that were almost twice my age and had way more experience but the position that you've taken on in that shoot is to to do that job and they're looking to you so yeah it can be tough sometimes and and extremely intimidating and yeah I don't know just fake it to you make it I just 100% yeah you have to just keep pretending that you can just keep getting paid yeah yeah as long as you're going to check you all right but but to me too it was it was I especially early on I cared less and less about the the money as long as I could like deliver and like I'd rather not get paid I mean as long as I have some money as long as I could pay rent but I'd rather this client be happy and if they're not happy I'd rather give them their money back you want to do some rapid fire questions sure let's see if I have them I'm not very quick yeah well actually you know what I got it dude I actually I got a question for you this is a new thing I haven't done this before but question do you know the rock no doing you know the rock doing rock Johnson no oh I know who he is but I never met him you don't know him personally I didn't they shot San Andreas in Australia but I didn't work on it I have friends that did I know his assistant in that was on that film for Kunder was his name but Kundo yeah all right but this is a start this is a start because that's my big raise of separation to the rock yeah I can do that that's my big goal right now is I want to interview the rock I want to get I want to get I want the rock to sit in that chair across from me yeah that's my big goal I'll talk to Kunder talk to Kundo let's see if so he just pay what she's probably not doing much yeah he's he's just a good time a little little downtime in between I'm trying to to reach out to as many people as I can how what do you think I should do in order to get the rock because this is a podcast that a couple hundred people listen to it's not very big well maybe you need to put together a video like that guy did for Emma Watson no Emma's Emma Stone Emma Watson I always get them confused the go out of Lala land Emma so and he asked it to be the prom date did you see that you recreated the opening to Lala land and then it was like will you be my prom date did it work did it work though did you she responded as she said sorry so but he got a rejection yeah exactly so I don't want to get rejected by the rock yeah yeah but that's still pretty amazing but maybe he won't be busy yeah maybe somebody else filled in for her why the rock it's hard to put in words he's an interesting what the rock is done yeah he's pretty he's a very interesting actor because you do all these strange kind of what looks to be a sellout film but he's actually right into the craft as well so yeah he is interesting mix he definitely is is I like all sides of him he also seems like a guy who's completely humble yeah I mean he's one of the highest paid actors you might need a big chair that's actually you know what maybe I'll take the hinges off the side of the chair you need a bigger room yeah I'll get I'll bring the couch in here but he's a guy that's like he's he's very inspiring in terms of like his fitness and like you ever see his his his meal plan what he eats in a given day that's all like some reporter tried to eat what he ate in a day and like was throwing up by noon I think like that that alone like and then in the fact that like he doesn't have to do that right now he's quote unquote made it he's gotten to a point where he has success in his career he could certainly like chill but he like he really this is where he finds this is what he's passionate about and he really enjoys it and he's kind of he does a little bit of everything he's got a production company does all this stuff so he's somebody who who has I think built something from the ground up literally starting from nothing to to kind of and and still building new things along the way and continuing to do it I think is pretty inspiring yeah like who would have thought like the WWE wrestling star WWE F at the time would get to the point now where he's the highest paid actor in the world like that's insane so I think I want to interview him about his story but this is the first time I brought it up on the podcast it's going to be a thing that I want but I'm pretty sure he watches yeah yeah yeah yeah that's the thing it's not about your size your audience it's the size of the rock but yeah well we'll see this is going to be an ongoing journey I'm going to try to ask everybody that comes on the show how they might be able to put me in touch with the rock yeah I'll do my best who is that little send a name out for you well yeah oh that would be great no promises but no promises but hey my friend wants to put you put the rock on his body if I could actually interview the rocks assistant that would be like let's do the right direction the gold coast but okay maybe next time and then I'll show you sometimes yeah that's it it's worth reaching out so there's this funny video of Fakundo scaling milk and saying he's going to turn into the rock and be massive and then throws down the milk and cut to it's the rock finishing sculling the milk oh my god that's pretty cool that's good that's on his YouTube the the Rock YouTube channel I just know it's on YouTube okay I'm going to have to find that maybe I'll put rock sculling milk rock sculling milk yeah try that might be some weird shit let me see if truth be told I didn't write any questions this is I typically the first time that I ever did a rapid fire question I like it was an idea that I had before like like probably weeks before I had done the podcast and then it was leading to the end of it and I was like you're ready for rapid fire right so yeah and I was like fuck I didn't write any rapid fire questions so and I started to write them as I was asking them that's what I'm going to have to do now what drives you what drives you to keep going and this might sound bad but it's sense to achieve I don't know it's just part of me is I always want to achieve stuff whether it be climate mountain right a good wave I didn't know even finished the house chores before I sit down and watch a movie or something like that I don't know that's just who I am and it sounds really lame and boring but I just want to achieve I just like achieving things I'm winning winning I like winning too is it the act of winning or is it the kind of like does do you still get excited I love to rub it yeah yeah it's what it's all about you know like it's not about getting the paycheck at the end of the the thing or or like finishing the film it's kind of about doing something about the adventure I love the adventure as well but my mind is just full of lists and so to be honest part of it is just ticking off each box you have like I've done that I've done that you have like an actual list or do you have like a mental list I have lots of lists but my notes in my phone is full of lists whether it's books to read film ideas things to do paper to email or kinds of different random things it's just how I work but I think my mind I'm not very good at remembering stuff so I just ride it down as long as it's written down I can always deal with it so what advice would you give to somebody an a non-film maker setting out in an creative pursuit what one thing should they what one thing can they do today that's going to help it sounds like a simple answer again but work hard the people I've seen succeed mainly in the film industry because that's what I work in but I think also in any terms setting up a business doing well whether it be in real estate finance as a school teacher whatever you do comes down to working hard as long as you stick at working hard for long enough eventually things will happen for you and and you'll crack whatever you're trying to crack so if you're starting a business working extremely hard at that business but also working smart not just putting in hours and hours of wasted time at getting advice from the right people getting help from say you need a graphic designer to do your logo like paying the right people to to make you better than the next person or make your business stand out better than the next business but at the end of the day it comes down to working hard but you talked about the rock like look at his schedule he trains so hard every day he sticks to such a regiment regimented day but look at the results like he's in all these Hollywood films so he's doing really well yeah there's a reason why like he does that stuff it's because it works it's and unfortunately some people just get lucky and you're like they did nothing and they just got cast in a film or their dad is the CEO of some company and they got him good in or something like that but hard work sustains you like that will keep you going through your career if if somebody's dad gets them a job first out first time out of school they might get lucky for that first one or two films but people find out pretty quick whether they're actually going to be an asset to the to the work or not so before somebody goes to bed tonight what would you tell them to read watch or listen to and it might be starting oh there we go that's an easy one set life there's one that's what I can read to read set life it's available what's the website set life book dot set life book dot com I mean I'm Amazon it's it for everybody it's Amazon yeah I do have a quite a bit of the core audience is filmmakers and creative so I think this would actually be incredibly helpful for them let's let's wipe that one okay on a series that I read a whole bunch of stuff and mine's generally aimed at producing so I'll read a lot of producers books like Ted Hope is released book called Hope for film which is great one call say you think you're a producer by a Lawrence term and I think it is so I focus on stuff like that but I read anybody that's inspirational to me so Walt Disney has a bunch of biographies out which I found incredible he was an incredible person hmm I found Steve Jobs book inspiring just of what he about what he created he might have been an interesting character but he can't argue with what he's actually created yeah that's a really really I think well rounded book too yeah shelling both sides of him yeah exactly and then but I also read novels and stories and all kinds of stuff just to get that creative kind of producing side of me going and thinking of stories or I might want to try an option or book or that kind of stuff hmm that didn't give you one specific answer no but I think that's enough I think there should be anything as long as you're reading and learning from people you're always been moving forward so yeah I'll go through extensive six months I'm like I haven't read anything for six months and I'll feel dry creatively because I'm not getting that import of just people telling stories or I feel uninspired because I haven't read about somebody else's struggle when they're first starting out as a producer or a filmmaker or whatever so anything I think just pick up books and read them and get advice from people that have done it before yeah I tend I'd go through the same thing where there will be maybe six months where I don't read a book and then I'll read like 15 20 books in a row and it's it I feel guilty when I'm not doing it and I part of and that's just who I am always guilty about everything but I feel like there is there's an aspect to you do go and laws and that's fine be okay with it but then I think there's a lot of inspiration that you can gather from from books podcast learning from other people and then hearing from other people's stories so good that's what yeah watch at the moment I'm watching I watch so many things this is bad to admit it but I never got through breaking bad so I'm in the fault season at the moment watching that yeah because sorry many people bring it up I'm like I haven't seen it yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah you have to what there's certain series that you have to have watched and breaking bad as well it's like okay yeah yeah yeah oh I'll get through that now yes I'm almost done it's fantastic um I don't know watch whatever it whatever you enjoy there's so much content out there now it's it's hard it's ridiculous how many choices you have like how many times you sit on Netflix or Amazon or whatever and just spend the next half an hour trying to decide what you want to watch rather than just spend more time looking for what actually watching something what uh what's so I I I can never answer like favorite thing favorite movie like I can't do that just because there's just too many but it's I guess favorite of late so has there been something on Netflix maybe besides minimum of course oh minimum yeah yeah what if number one document yeah of 2016 um I'm actually watching Amazon at the moment the man in the high castle and it's such an interesting concept of if Japan and uh the Nazis won World War II beautiful shot like that is just a one-line synopsis and immediately everybody's like that's a great idea cool how you do that is a whole now the story um and the series is incredible of what they've created I've found the second uh season a little bit drags on and just becomes about the drama whereas I like the situation rather than the drama I don't care about the love stories where my wife gets sold or all the relationships that's going on I just want to see interesting situations people get put in and um and then listen do you listen I've just started again I went through a big phase probably three or four years ago where I'd listened to a podcast on my way to work because I did a lot of driving for work um and then stopped I hadn't really listened to them for probably two or three years and literally about a week ago I just subscribed to a whole new bunch I was telling you earlier about this American life how I just listened to those random stories and it inspires me to to think about other stories or they'll they'll say one sentence about a character and it'll prompt me to go and write a short synopsis about what if this character did this or um that kind of stuff that's great any final final words just keep going so many people get discouraged along the way because I don't know our generation particularly it's probably like you can do anything you'll be doing anything you'll be a millionaire like 25 you'll be the boss of everybody but it's not the truth it actually takes a lot of time and you can look at filmmakers like working with really Scott he directed his first film when it was early 40s like how many directors are actually going to wait until their early 40s to direct their first film and think like just continue on that um so for me I think just for young people getting into it like just just keep going and have some patience right have some patience and and also enjoy what you're doing like looking back on the films that I've worked with or the people that I've worked with is so cool and and even just to the relationships that I've built with with friends that I've spent 60 hours a week with for six months straight and things like that and how you get to know their family or their kids and and that kind of stuff and support them on their journey whether they're friends that are also assistant directors that want to be directors or whether they're a young camera person looking to be a DP and that kind of stuff just supporting their journey as well that's great man so thanks for coming on the show and that's it that's it I say that's okay right got that's a wrap that's good thanks for tuning into the ground up show I'm giving away access to two hours worth of extended interviews to anyone who reviews the ground up show on iTunes these
