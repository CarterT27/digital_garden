https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZvsS9PdEn8
When I first started out as a filmmaker I thought storytelling was all about getting the right soundbites, capturing the necessary b roll, throwing in some music & adding a fancy color grade. The technical aspect of the job, stitching it all together, was exciting and new, but it distracted me from telling the best story I could.

How do you become a good storyteller? Antonia Hylton breaks down the key lesson’s she’s learned as a reporter telling incredibly challenging stories for Vice News Tonight. This is the advice I need to remind myself before heading into every shoot.

This is a clip from episode 016 of The Ground Up Show.

 You know what it really was? It's like I would be having conversations with people that I'm talking to you now and be anticipating the next thing I'd be trying to think like I have to nail this politician on this thing and it's gonna be my third question You know like that that was like where my right I was thinking like it was a game of chess and some of that is healthy Like you want to go in with a plan you want to go in with like things you know you need to get out of an interview or get out of a character Elements of their personality that you want to tease out by by talking to them in a certain way Definitely need that but you don't want to go in with like So much of a plan that you're not listening Because most of story being a good storyteller actually just requires you to shut up so much of the time Like you just actually need to listen to people you're not gonna tell their story correctly You're not gonna find the elements of of it that other reporters others storytellers have missed if you're not actually just Being quiet most of the time and thinking and reacting to what's happening around you And so I learned better how to to listen and I think like literally you can watch my work and you'll see Progress that I'm listening more and that my questions react more just because sort of naturally like what I hear What's going on around me and not so much like a plan that I came in or a vision that I previously had for what the piece would be How do you going into an interview I always feel like especially if you're interviewing somebody like it's interviewed a lot like say if you're going somebody High profile that just sitting down talking with reporters or journalists every day and you want to create a Story and experience for them that's that's different, right? You don't want to just go in and say okay, here's the 10 questions they get asked every time because they go on autopilot And then it's like there's this scripted can responses How do you get out of that and how do you approach these interviews in a way that you're gonna be able to get something that's That's actually genuine and not like the the guys of being genuine Probably the two ways in which I I'm able to do that and something like you can't do that with because like they are pros They like they don't show you anything about themselves that they haven't planned to publicly show so sometimes You can't do it But a lot of times you know, I'll be sitting in a politician's office and usually their staff Let's you and first and you can set up and they haven't come in yet and I'll just look around and no Don't you're asking Not that creepy and I like going through their belongings opening their wallet No, but I like they have all these cute weird pictures of their kids or things that they did when they were 20 You know, I was in a politician's office the other day and I noticed they were all these like you know There was a fireman's hat and there were what's a lot of You know It's just small trinkets and and books look related to sort of being a man a man in uniform And so I pick up those little things about their personality may have nothing to do with what you're there to talk about But I can just sort of get a sense of like who they are in their private life and then when they sit down and we're Mikeing them before we're rolling I just start asking them about like yeah who they are or that weird thing I saw Strange quote they have in the corner of it don't make any sense to me like kind of disarm them a tiny bit You know, I've showed him I'm a human being who has some interest in him as a human being and you know that He can Respond to me and he can bring up thoughts or he can bring up ideas about whatever situation we're discussing And it can be like a little bit freer and loose, you know like you don't just have 20 minutes to hammer through Whatever the major trump talking point is for the week like we can like be real for a few minutes at the end middle Start middle and end and that's what I usually try to like kind of subconsciously or kind of casually show anyone that I interview from a politician to Gavin Grimm I want them to know like I'm a real person here who wants to tell a True story
