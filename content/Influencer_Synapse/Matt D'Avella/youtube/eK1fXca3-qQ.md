being here thank you how do most people know you you know what what are you most known for most people probably know me from my writing uh so I read at jamesclear.com first article I put up there was November 12th 2012 and I had been I've been an entrepreneur for two years for that and I didn't really know what I was doing like most entrepreneurs when you start out and so I was reading a lot about consumer psychology to figure out like why would someone buy a product why would someone sign up for an email list or whatever because I realized I didn't know anything about marketing and that led me to behavioral psychology so then I was reading more about habit formation and kind of going down this rabbit hole and I kept a bunch of notes on my own about habit it's just kind of like James' thoughts on habits and it was 60 or 65 pages long and eventually I was like alright I should publish something from this and so I put out that first article and I said I'm gonna write a new article every Monday and Thursday I don't think it's anything magical about that pace but I just picked that and I did that for the next three years and that was really the thing that changed everything for me so you know I went from zero I think at the end of the first year I had like 34,000 subscribers and the second year was like 100 and 30 years like 220 and then 4th years like 400 and now we're in the mid force but we went over 500 and then cut like 80,000 people who just were you know kind of faded away and weren't reading anymore but yeah so I the short answer is I think most people know me from my writing yeah it's funny that you say that about the cutting of the subscribers yeah because that's something I just talked about with David Chery where he's thinking about doing that with his list where there is this minimalism philosophy I play but like you're you're paying to have those people on your list and if they don't get value from it if they're not using it what's the point like it's nice to have that the biggest number you possibly can but you know what isn't really matter it's a little bit of a trade off because the people do care about the status signal or the bigger number and depending on what your business model is like if you were gonna get a book deal or something publisher would like a bigger number to be on your you know the marketing part of your proposal or something so you could make a business argument for it there but yeah I also get it's interesting how you get tied to numbers you know you get tied to the growth but you also get tied to the open rate and as you know I like I took a lot of pride in the fact that my open rate was very high and a lot of people were reading the articles and then you keep growing it becomes very hard to keep that up so we did it just to clean that up a little bit and make sure that a lot of people are engaging with each email hmm do you are you concerned yourself too much with the numbers because obviously that's something that a lot of people are trying to get after they're trying to get X amount of subscribers or Instagram followers and it can be you know it's it's not a fun game to play because once you get it it doesn't solve any problems I think early in my career I was very obsessed them you know I'd be checking like how many new subscribers do I have and I would be checking like multiple times a day checking my traffic every day now you know I barely log in even once a month but there's this thing called good hearts law that says a measure ceases to be a good measure when it becomes the target and so the point is like imagine you're trying to lose weight if you use the scale as a measurement as a data point then yeah it can be useful is like one signal and you're overall health but if it becomes the target if the whole mission of getting in shape becomes about making the scale go lower well then you start doing a lot of unhealthy things just to get the scale removed you know you may sack me may do some crazy juice clans or some kind of radical diet or you end up doing unhealthy things in the name of moving the number and I think that there's a lot of application of that in creativity and business as well if the number becomes the target then you kind of lose sight of the bigger picture and so I I feel like I try to remind myself that measurements are just a piece of the larger puzzle and I can use them to inform and make sure I'm moving in the right direction but don't spend too much time obsessing over any individual metric yeah it's like counting calories and using that as your only metric for success like if if I really only eat 2,000 calories a day or 1,000 calories a day then I'm gonna be living a healthy lifestyle but there's definitely a lot of shit food that you could eat that's right not gonna be helping to live you could just do 1500 calories of Twinkies yeah technically fulfill that obligation but and it doesn't help to check to look at the numbers you know if you're incessant in every day you're opening an up and saying well where am I now where am I at now it doesn't actually move the number or change what you're doing well this is I wrote about this in a atomic habits a little bit that it's this idea between the system and the goal and you know like say you're playing a sport in every sport the goal is to have the best score on the scoreboard at the end of the game but it would be ridiculous to spend all game looking at the scoreboard because it wouldn't help you in any way so in fact if you just ignored the score the entire time and just focus on a better process or playing it a better way or a better scheme or strategy then you probably would end up with the best score I think the wall she was the super goal winning head coach for the San Francisco 49ers he had this quote was like the score takes care of itself and that I think that probably applies to a lot of tracking and measurement yeah that actually so I did want to bring this up I read that you wrote you do not rise to the level of your goals you fall to the level of your systems and I think that kind of goes against a lot of our intuition and it goes against every motivational YouTube video that I've ever seen so what does that really mean well this is coming from someone who's been very goal oriented for a long time so I would set goals for the grades I wanted to get in school or the weights I wanted to lift in the gym or the the amount of revenue I wanted my business or how many emails subscribers I wanted like all of that and at some point I realized you know I'm setting all these goals like it might actually achieving some of them and sometimes I would but there are plenty of times where I failed and so I have this realization that well if that's the case then setting a goal cannot be the thing that means whether or not I achieved success and if you think about this the winners and losers in any domain a lot of the time they have the same goals you know like every person who applies for a job has the goal of getting the job every Olympian has the goal of winning the gold medal and so if winners and losers have the same goals then the goal can't be the thing that makes the difference and I don't mean that goals are useless I think goals are actually quite useful for setting a sense of direction or knowing you know which basically what area the the boat should be pointed in what direction the boat should point in where you're trying to row but once you've decided that it's probably more useful to put the goal on the shelf and focus exclusively on the system or the process and in my language habits make up the system and they're like this collection of behaviors and patterns that you perform each day and when you put them all together you end up with this system that delivers a result and whatever your results are in life or in business or wherever your current system is perfectly designed to deliver them it has to be by definition that's why you're getting those results so if you want different results what you need is not really a different goal we need a different system and then how do we start to shape those systems in our lives so in a lot of ways we're talking about designing our lives so then we can make these habits stick better right right how do we go about doing that well there are a lot of ways in the book I lay out what I call the four laws of behavior change and the way that I describe is they're kind of like each one's like a little lever and when the levers are in the wrong positions it's really hard to build good habits and break that once in one there in the right positions it's much easier and each one of those it's kind of like a toolbox and you just have to pick the right tools for whatever the job is that you're facing it's not you know some formula like just do exactly this but I'll give you one example so let's say that you wanted to build a better I'll give you an example bringing a good or building a good habit and bringing a battle so one of the laws is to make it obvious and this largely comes down to like what we're exposed to each day and minimalism and simplicity plays a big role in this and the book I call it environment design that's basically the strategy so for a long time I realized that I brush my teeth twice a day but I didn't floss consistently and when I looked at that habit one of the reasons that I wasn't flossing consistently is because the floss was hidden in the drawer in the bathroom so I just wouldn't see it you know like I wouldn't open up the drawer and remember so I bought a little bowl and got some of the pre-made flossers and put them in the bowl and placed it right next to my toothbrush so now I brush my teeth put the toothbrush down pick the flosser up it's right there just that one little environment design change is pretty much all I needed to do to build the habit of flossing every day on the other side let's say you know a lot of people feel like they spend too much time watching TV or playing video games or just looking at a screen but if you walk into pretty much any living room where do all the couches and chairs face they all face the television so it's like what does that room design to get you to do it's designed to get you to watch TV so there are a variety of levels to this you could for example take the remote and take it off of the coffee table and put it inside a drawer where you could take the television and put it inside like a wall unit or a cabinet so that you don't see it you could also increase the friction of the task so you could like take the batteries out of the remote after each use and then you know it's an extra five or ten seconds put it in maybe that's just enough time if you'd think do I really want to watch something or am I just doing this mindlessly you could unplug the TV after each individual use and then only plug it in if you can say the name of the show you want to watch so you can't like mindlessly browse on Netflix and I mean if you really wanted to be extremely about it you could take the TV off the wall put it in the closet and then only take it out when you really want to watch something but the point here and this is kind of the the principle of environment design in general which is you want to put fewer steps between you and the go behaviors and more steps between you and the bad ones and imagine the cumulative impact of living an environment that exposes you to the cues of your positive habits and reduces the cues of your negative habits it's kind of like you're just gently being nudged in the right direction each day and that's just one of the of the ways that you can sort of design a system that leads you into better habits I think we're going to get a lot of people to start flossing I'm actually concerned to and I do because I'm so bad at flossing I actually finally found a dentist that doesn't judge me but my lack of flossing and my lack of going to the dentist I'll go to the dentist maybe like once every three years but that's a one other story you said something interesting which is that a lot of these things that we're doing are mindless that we almost don't have control over ourselves and a lot of people think all you need is good self control but I don't think that you could ever achieve what you want by just strictly using self control so why are we mindless and is that why we need to develop habits your brain is always developing habits so it's happening whether you want it to happen or not and the question is can you take control of the process and in a lot of ways the fact that we have these mindless automatic behaviors it's a pretty good system that evolution is designed I mean if you think about from a very high level you're as you go throughout life you are facing problems and some of those problems are big problems and some of them are really small ones like you need to tie your shoe and your brain whenever you come across a solution to the problem that you're facing and you repeat it again and again your brain starts to automate that so you know you tire shoe once and it the first time it takes some effort and so on but then you do it 50 or 100 or 200 times and pretty soon you can tire shoes while having a conversation or thinking about something else or whatever and this is sort of the role that habits play in our lives is that they are these mental shortcuts these kind of automatic scripts that you can just play whenever the situation or the context is right and they free up cognitive resources to focus your attention elsewhere and so that's a really good system overall it's we use it all day long without thinking about it but occasionally it can serve us poorly because you know so let's let's say you come on from work and you feel stressed and exhausted and that's a problem that needs to have some kind of solution so for one person maybe they learn that if I play video games for an hour I'm no longer stressed and exhausted for another person maybe learn if I smoke a cigarette I reduce stress for a third person maybe it's meditating for ten minutes for fourth person maybe they run for a half hour and the point here is that different solutions can cause the can solve the same recurring problems throughout life and so your original habit is not necessarily the optimal habit for solving whatever the situations are that you come across their life the problems that you face day in and day out and so if you can you becomes more about designing a better solution to those to those problems and that's really that's where my focus is is like all right we're building habits anyway how can we develop better solutions to the recurring problems in our life it's there's such thing as I guess central habits that can help to shift and transform other aspects of your life because that's something that I've noticed a little bit where if I start eating better or if I start going to the gym every day it's almost like a domino or ripple effect where these other habits start to pick up naturally because I'm certain to feel better so like as I've been going to the gym five days a week so now when I come home I don't feel like binging out on junk food I feel like eating better food or if I wake up early is that something you've noticed in your research yeah sure so there are two ways to answer this question so the first way is what your describing is often sometimes called a keystone habit and the idea is you do one thing and it like ripples into other areas of your life and so for me it's exercise like if I go to the gym then I get the benefits of exercise but I also tend to eat better I like for some reason I just don't want to waste it I also focus more so I have sort of that like post workout high after I work out and then I sleep better because I'm tired from the workout which means I wake up the next morning and I have better energy and at no point was that trying to build better sleep habits or energy habits or focus habits or nutrition habits but all that kind of just came as a side effect of doing this one thing of going to the gym so other common keystone habits are budgeting sometimes people say when they pay off debt you'll then they'll like start to get in shape or they you know build but they're more social and have better relationships so like there's all kinds of things that kind of come out of that going for daily walk is a really big one it's very common one among creators in particular there's a book called Daily Rituals by Mason Curie and he basically just writes down like what I don't know it's a hundred or hundred or hundred fifty famous like creators and scientists and whatever what their daily routines were and a lot of them were raging alcoholics and on amphetamines and all kinds of other stuff but the ones who were more healthy daily have a daily have it like walking was a really big part of their routine visualization is a big one especially for performers like a comedian or something they'll often visualize the same kind of result or professional athletes before they step out on the stage or step out on the court and then another one is meditation and this one you hear a lot with like CEOs and leaders if they get like their ten minutes of meditation in the morning the rest of the day just kind of goes more smoothly so that's the first way to answer that question is what the keystone habit the second way is through what I call a decisive moment and basically there are these little moments throughout the day well if you depending on what research study you look at habits account for 40 to 50% of our daily behaviors and this is all the stuff that you're just doing without even thinking you know tying your shoes or unplugging the toast or after each time you use it or whatever but the true influence of your habits is even greater than that because in many ways habits are kind of like a fork in the road they're like an entrance ramp on the highway so you do something mindlessly like you pull your phone out of your pocket and you don't even think about it takes five seconds but after you do that it shapes the next like 20 minutes of conscious attention and choices that you're making so maybe you browse social media or you respond to email or you play a video game but whatever choice you're making was already the context was already shaped by that mindless habit of pulling your phone out and so I would refer to that as like a decisive moment that these little automatic actions that you do them and then after 30 seconds they've already shaped the next 20 minutes or the next chunk of time that's going to come so in my personal life you know like there's a moment around 515 each night my wife gets on from work and either we change into our workout clothes and we go to the gym or we don't change into our workout clothes and we watch you know reruns the office in order to take out or whatever and really the next two hours are kind of determined by that decisive moment of whether we change into our workout clothes or not we change it closed then like everything else is gonna happen automatically we're gonna drive to the gym I'll get into the bar I'll do it's already pre-decided basically so one of the realizations of this and it comes back to your kind of central question of what you know what are the most important habits to build or are there ones that ripple into other areas of life if you can just master maybe 5 or 10 decisive moments throughout the day these little kind of two-minute chunks that determine the next block of time you really only have to focus your attention and energy on that and the the rest of it kind of comes easily you don't have to do that much if you can master the right moments it's kind of like judo for your personal habits you know you apply the pressure in the right place and everything else kind of falls in line and I think from what I've heard about building habits too it's usually a fools attempt to try to build 10 habits 15 habits at once and I've certainly tried to do that where I'm like you know what no this time it's gonna happen like I'm gonna plan up the next 30 days and I'm gonna read every day and I start exercising every day I'm gonna start doing all this and then what happens like seven days eight days and everything just starts dropping by the wayside in three months later I look back at this journal that's empty and just depressed so is there something to building slowly and is it would you just recommend one at a time depends on which expert you talk to some people think oh if you do two or three and they're really small then that can be good because you're kind of like developing the skill of building a little habit personally I only do one at a time and I think that's a better approach the other reason I recommend that is that what really changes your your outcomes or what really moves your life in a positive direction is not a single like one percent change or a single little habit it's a collection of them all organized turns the same like overall goal or overall outcome so you know sometimes people will they get like you know a fit bit and they start they get a fit bit and they start walking 10,000 steps a day or something like that and then they get frustrated after three months because they haven't seen this change in the mirror this change on the scalar whatever but it's like well that's good but that's just one habit related to your health you don't need a single little habit you need like a thousand of them and once you kind of build this collection of them all moving you in the same direction it's kind of like each one adds little grain of sand to the side of the scale and eventually you tip the scales in your favor and I think that's another reason to start with one habit at a time is that you naturally sort of pick up other behaviors that are related to the overall thing that you're working on in the moment and that helps keep you focused rather than trying to do two or three things then you get scattered but there's another way to answer this question which is probably one of the most common questions I get is how long does it take to build a habit and people will like oh I think you know I've heard it takes 21 days or it takes 30 days or there was one research study that said 66 days on average that numbers floating around a lot now but that even that study the range was quite wide so you know depending on the habit you're building if you want something simple like drinking a glass of water at lunch that would take a few weeks if you want something more complicated like going for a run after work that would take seven or eight months but even that the point that question how long does it take to build a habit it's sort of implicitly has the wrong approach which is oh this is just like a finish line for me to cross it's basically the implicit assumption behind that question is how long do I have to work before this is done and the honest answer to how long is it take to build a better habit or build a new habit is forever because if you stop doing it it's no longer a habit right so I think the point here is that habits are not a finish line to cross their lifestyle to live and so if you can adopt that philosophy then it helps to change your approach a little bit you know like you talk about oh should do this is going to be different this time will work really hard for 30 days will do these 10 or 15 things but no just start with something really small one percent change a lifestyle change that you can sustain because if you're going to do something forever it's going to become part of your lifestyle you want it to be moderate enough that you can actually stick to it you know you can ask yourself the question like can I stick to this habit 98% of the time no matter what the circumstances and if you can then it's probably too big scale it down in some way a lot of times we're not thinking about the long-term approach because we want our lives to change in this instant if we're overweight or depressed like we just want to be able to flip a switch and change but that's obviously that's never going to work but if you do take that long-term approach really like all right well if I set out to start this business today it's going to likely be a couple years before I ever get any revenue so I need to start slow but if I keep at it every single day eventually it will keep up or it'll pick up and I think that's kind of I'm sure in part what you learned you said you started writing two days a week or releasing a blog post two days a week and you kept it up for three years from day one did you tell yourself like this is how long I'm going to do this for was it like I'm just going to start writing two days a week and I'm just going to commit to that and then see where it goes people think that they want their results to change but actually the results are not the thing that needs to change so like if you have a messy room then you could get really motivated in the moment and then clean you know clean everything up through the clutter away whatever and you have a clean room today but if you don't change the sloppy habits that led to a messy room in the first place then you're just going to have a messy room again in like two months and so the in many ways like wanting our lives to change today wanting a different result wanting a different outcome is it's really like treating a symptom without treating the cause the results don't need to change if the habits change the results will change automatically it'll it'll just follow naturally to answer a question about my writing habit I I don't really know what I started out with an intention of I can't really think a remember that I wanted something in particular I do remember thinking if I can just get to 10,000 subscribers then I'll be said I don't know why why it was that number but that was the number at the time that seemed like yeah if I get there it'll be good and of course you know that was not true at all you have to keep there's nothing magical that happens at that number or any number really yeah but it's there might be something in that like you said there is something to goals or at least maybe it does push you forward you're not looking at the scoreboard the entire time but it still is almost like a guiding post to say no you gotta keep going and that's why I think sometimes we have to set goals that are a little bit ridiculous that stretch a little bit further than what we think we could do because it's going to push you forward and keep you going I think what you need is a sense of direction sometimes this is really hard for me early on when I was an entrepreneur the way that I would describe it is having a job is like being in a raft or being in a kayak and being in a river and so the boundaries are set they say this is the direction you're going your job is to like row down the river quickly and avoid obstacles and you know just generally do a good job whereas being an entrepreneur is kind of like being on a raft in the middle of the ocean and you can you get to choose where do you want to go today you can go wherever you want but if you're not careful about it you just row around circles all day and I think that that's the usefulness of having some kind of goal or some kind of guide post is that it provides a more clear direction for you to work in but once that direction is set it is mostly by your habits have you learned anything about decision making as an entrepreneur and as a business owner because that's one of those things that it's usually pretty easy when you're by yourself say if I'm just gonna go out vlogging or filming for the day I've got nobody else to worry about it's just me and I've done this so many times that you know the decision making's almost in a way like I have it take care of themselves I start setting up the shot without even thinking about it but then you put yourself into new scenarios where okay now instead of you know doing a one-person crew I'm gonna be working with 20 people and now I've got 20 people coming to me asking me to make decisions about something and I remember the first couple of times I was in that scenario it was like deer and headlights where I it was really hard for me to make any decision because I felt like it was gonna be the wrong one and that I would screw up and I think that's probably one of the the biggest mistakes that that people can make is because you're not pushing yourself forward you know you make a if you make a decision and make a mistake that's fine but if you don't make a decision at all you're standing still yeah there's like a indecision is worse than wrong decision there's a there's a rose about quote about that or something like the the the the best decision is the right decision the second best decision is the wrong decision then the worst decision is no decision because yeah if you don't make a bad decision you can't revise it but to answer your larger question I have thought about decision making a lot and actually it ties in really well with this conversation about habits because I think that decision making and habits are sort of the two pillars of living a better life or living a productive life so you can think about this way your decisions set the trajectory for or the options the potential your decision set the potential for your life so let's say that you want to be an entrepreneur you could start like a local pizza parlor if you wanted so that's one decision or you could choose to start you could start like a software start up or something and either way you're gonna be working hard because being an entrepreneur is tough but the trajectory of those two businesses is very different like if you drew out the dotted line of the potential of having like a local pizza parlor having a software company maybe let's say in this example the software company has a like a steeper slope or more of that hockey stick growth curve however your habits determine how much of that potential you realize so they determine how far you walk along that line mapped out by your initial decision and in that way you could start say the local pizza parlor and have really killer habits and end up walking further along that journey and achieving more success than someone who had a good idea with a text start up but then didn't have the habits to execute on it and so I think they kind of like work together with one another your decisions kind of creating this leverage for you or this potential leverage and your habits determining how much of that leverage you actually capture a lot of times with entrepreneurs we can kind of get into that that hustle mode the grind mode where we're working a bit too hard and working for working sake and not really thinking about creating a balance life how do you and and early on I think when when we're younger it's easier imagine what success would look like we just look at TV and we we usually think of material things as what are successful lives would be like in the future how do you now look at success like how do you live a balance life and make sure that your work isn't spilling and and taking over your personal relationships is really hard it's especially hard if you set a high standard for yourself like I mean if you really do want to do great work so you know you're right often successes to find a material standards having a big house something nice car having a lot of money your bank account whatever but even if you even if you dismiss those standards for success and you make it about something else like producing really high quality creative work or something like that or producing worth you feel proud of um the truth of the matter is we often feel proud of our work based on how it compares to the others around us like how do we know that creative work is good how do we know youtube videos amazing well it's because we've seen a lot of them and so we sort of implicitly rank order it relative to the other videos that we've already watched so you're there's some level of comparison that's always a part of that calculus that's going on in your mind and even if you make it about less materialistic things and more personal things it's hard it's very hard to get over that wiring of judging yourself relative to others so uh the thing that makes this really tough is that there are seven billion people in the world and so for any domain you're going to find someone who is willing to sacrifice pretty much every other area of their life to be really great at that one thing you're gonna find someone who is a videographer that it says I'm not having kids I'm not getting married I'm just focusing on this and I'm gonna do it as every hour of the day you're gonna find a basketball player who is like I'm waiting on everything else basketball is the center of my life and that is true for pretty much any major area or domain there's going to be somebody who's willing to make more sacrifices and the other thing is that those people are often quite smart and talented and intelligent and so you can say things like work smarter not harder but you're being kind of delusional if you think that you can beat other smart people who are going to work twice as long as you at the same craft and this ends up getting to a challenging place because I don't want to lower my expectations right I don't want to I don't want to say well good enough is good enough like I want to produce something that's really great so you run into this really difficult trade-off of do I lower my standards a little bit and realize that this is the game that we're playing and there are a lot of people and it's going to be really hard to be world-class it's going to be very difficult to be number one if I'm not willing to dedicate my life to it but I still need to like approach it each day as being number one and the only solution that I've come up to this to this problem and I don't even know that it's a good long-term one or not but the only one that I've managed so far is that if you were to take like a seed and put it into the ground you wouldn't criticize it when it's a seed for not being a tree yet and when it's a sapling you wouldn't criticize it for being a sapling and not being like a full-grown oak or whatever at each stage of the process it's perfectly good at what it is. However a plant also does not stop growing it does it is always growing it's always contained to improve and I think that we need to be kind of gracious and forgiving with ourselves like that at each whatever stage of the creative process or personal process wherever you're at in your journey that's fine you're perfectly defined for what that stage is but humans grow and expand and improve and progress and so I want to like not lose my ambition even though I'm not yet the full-grown oak compared to whoever else is like in this domain. It's very hard to find that off switch when you're ambitious when and sometimes like you said I think it was like 515 when your wife comes home or whatever like those kind of signals certainly help and I found that too with my partner when she comes home I try to shut down work I'm not going to be working past 5 or 6 o'clock if I was single I definitely will. Yeah I need that right like if she wasn't there I wouldn't do it. Yeah so it's like it's just for the last one. Yeah yeah and yeah it's that signal that that helps you but then you know you could still work weekends if she's working a weekend sometimes I get really excited because I'm like yeah now I could work this weekend which is like an amazing position to be in because not everybody has that has the work that's truly fulfilling and then they love and but but I know that if I did that all the time if I worked every weekend I would be sacrificing too much I would know that I would look back and have regrets for not spending more time with my family friends for traveling and exploring and all these other things that I want to get out of life. I think so I just said that I only had one solution this but I think I have to so the the other thing that I like to recommend is thinking about your life in seasons and the current season that I'm in I don't have kids yet so it can be a career heavy season right I can focus on spending a lot of time pouring that and you can work weekends you can work later if your wife doesn't come home and you can do the best you can with the time allotted but then at some point I will have kids and that's a very different season so now you know now it's a more career light and I need to focus on family and you can define success in a different way at that season and that helps me a little bit get over the like the mental burden of feeling like oh I want to be graded all these things because it's like well maybe it's just not the season for that and of course there's also a level of simplicity and focus here I would love to be graded in music like I don't I don't know how to read music I don't know how to play any instruments but it's not the right season for that because every hour that I put into that every hour I get a music lesson or something is an hour that I can't be better at writing or you know whatever else is important to me in this moment and that trade-off is inherent in life and everybody faces it and at some point you have to be willing to make you have to cut out good uses of time so that you can have space for great uses of time and that's really easy to do when you're talking about like wasteful stuff it's like yeah you shouldn't watch you know all these clips on YouTube or whatever and it's like okay well that's the easy stuff to cut out the hard stuff to cut out is when it feels good it's like numbers four through six on your priority list but it's not numbers one two or three and that's also really easy to rationalize because like yeah I should be doing this it's all my priority list but yeah then you need to be focused yeah I have a lot of people that I've heard this comment a lot where it's like oh I have all these interests I've all these things that I'm really interested in like filmmaking photography web design all this stuff it's like I don't know like which one to to focus on and it's like you can't do all of them I don't think that sometimes naturally these things just like a keystone habit if you pick up filmmaking you're naturally going to start to get a little bit better at graphic design and composition and imagery and there are certain skills that can lend itself to other tasks but you got to pick one you got it and and I would say don't even don't pick two at least for the very beginning like pick one and try to dedicate yourself for the next three months or so to to just focus on that and then maybe down the road like I was never in a photography I was always really terrible at it and the people thought that since I was a filmmaker I would be good at taking photos and they would ask me to take photos of them and then they would see the photos and then they would just support it yeah they would be like oh this is terrible just because it is a totally different thing and now I've started to dabble a little bit more but I'm still I'm not I don't think I'll ever be at the point where I'm willing to dedicate myself a hundred percent to photography just because as much as I love it I don't think I'm going to be able to provide as much value or do my best work if I were to just drop everything else and focus on photo yeah there's a weird thing that happens if you do focus on one thing and become really amazing at it which is that it opens and magically opens up all these other options for you that you it's almost like there's a it's a shortcut other things you know like see someone who becomes an actor and actress and they do really amazing at that and then all of a sudden they could be this great humanitarian like the United Nations wants to work with them they want you know they want their help with that but if you just wanted to do humanitarian work from the start it would be really hard to get in contact for the United Nations so becoming at world class at one thing kind of opens up these avenues to do wildly different things as well but the challenge is the more successful you become at something the more opportunities come your way the more you need to learn to say no instead of and when you do say yes suddenly you're doing things that take away from the thing that you were great at at the first place so I don't know it's a it's a challenge of being successful I had a guy tell me the other day I was doing a speaking event with this company and he said nothing destroy success like success and I was like oh it's a pretty good saying he was like the CEO he tells the students his employees all the time because he's like look we've gotten good at this thing and now people are trying to do all this other stuff that were not great at because we have options now but we need to stay focused on the one thing that we do really well yeah I think that that advice could also even be applied to a lot so it's certain fields are really difficult to get into like acting where if you want to be a successful actor it's so much dependent upon there's still a lot of gatekeepers out there for acting you know yeah you can dab on indie films but if you want to be a professional working actor there's still going to be the talent agents and the representatives you need to go through a traditional system and like but then if you were to say all right you know what I'm going to be a filmmaker or a youtuber or a director and then eventually like you said if you become world class in that you could direct a movie that you're in you know there's there's other ways around it so is that something that's worthwhile to think about because we don't want to be dream killers to say like you can't be an actor don't focus on that but like there's an element of being realistic and taking control and maybe thinking about what's going to be the best likely scenario where I will have success or be world class at something well so there are all kinds of back doors and the things you know I mean I think it is important to think about what is your skill set and where does it overlap with um with what you want to achieve it's quite possible that there are plenty of people out there that would make much better producers or directors than they would actors even though their dream is to be an actor and so for them maybe the back door of being a director is a much better path to getting onto a screen at some point um and that's true you know we're just kind of playing with this little example here but I mean that's true in many different areas there are all kinds of ways to to work your way in and I think you need to be aware and honest about what your skills are so you can figure out the best path it's success inevitable if you work hard enough or are there just certain people that or is certain things that we would try to be say a professional musician that it would just never work it's just it's just like you want to be like I feel a bad saying that because a lot of times all you want to say is like you can do it if you just keep trying but sometimes you may if you won't make it I mean because there's nothing's guaranteed right we know that this is true with physical characteristics right if you're seven feet tall so this is the way that I think about it so if your um genes play an important role in your ability to do anything but we often don't like talking about genes in biology because they seem fixed and so if a characteristic is fixed then people don't want to talk about it because like well there's nothing I can do so miles will not try but that actually is not true so the way to think about it is that your genes and whether they enable you to be successful in a particular endeavor is highly dependent on context so if you're seven feet tall that is a huge advantage if you want to play basketball it's incredible hindrance if you want to be a good gymnast and so the usefulness of your genes is defined by the context of your environment and that's very obvious when you give a physical characteristic like that everybody would agree with that yeah it's going to be hard to tell someone who's seven feet tall just try harder you'll be a great gymnast someday but it's also true for psychological characteristics for mental abilities um and for personalities and so I have a chapter in the book where I talk about genes and habits and personality and how they all kind of tie together the most robust measurement of personality is the big five and it kind of maps your personality on five different spectrums the most common one the one that most people are familiar with is interversion and extroversion and each of these qualities each of these spectrums has been tied to your genes so there's some kind of like DNA or genetic underpinning that let's just say nudges you or primes you to have a certain type of personality and this can be tracked very early on so one interesting study they took some babies in the nursing ward and they played this very harsh noise on one side of the room and some of the babies turned toward the noise and some of them turned away and when they tracked them through their life the ones that turned toward the noise were more likely to grow up to be extroverts and the ones that turned away from the noise were more likely to grow up to be introverts and so there's there's something going on there biologically where we are primed to act in a certain way or to have a some type of personality and uh agreeableness is another one of the spectrums and people who are high and agreeableness tend to have higher natural levels of oxytocin um so there's you know there's some kind of biological underpinning going on there with what we would just call oh they seem to be a kind and warm person um and so we can use this to our advantage when we when it comes to uh building that are habits or achieving success uh which was your original question like how does this influence success by designing an environment that is more tailored to your particular genetic make-up you increase the odds that you can be successful at that task and this can happen on a large scale like um choosing the right option the way that I just gave that you know gymnasts versus basketball player example but it could also happen on a small scale with how you set up your office or how you go about your work each day if you're a person who is um who's low in conscientiousness for example which is another one of those five traits conscientiousness if you're high in it you're very orderly and planned so if you're low in it you're not much of a planner well in a situation like that it would make sense to have an environment that is really primed for certain habits because you're not going to be the type of person to keep it to do list and to make sure that you're following the checklist and so on and so in this way I think the punchline is that genes do not eliminate the need for strategy they inform it they they they tell you where to work hard not don't work hard and by better understanding your genetic make-up you can more you're more likely to be able to design an environment that favors you rather than one that hinders you yeah it seems like being self aware is is kind of like the key there in the very beginning to really understand yourself your strengths your weaknesses um that that's probably one of the most frustrating things is when you come across people that maybe aren't self aware and don't know how they're being portrayed or represented and they don't know what their strengths are uh when you look at those five characteristics was there any that you were surprised about by yourself or and like how do we go about figuring out which spectrum we are because oh it's so tough because sometimes I'm extroverted a lot times I'm introverted right like obviously there's maybe a leaning in certain areas and it's hard to really just put a stamp on it so first of all just the definition of personality is that it's the set of traits that follows you from situation to situation um so if you find that you're changing uh based on the context then that's more of an environmental influence unless of a personality trait okay and psychologists get uh they get in all these tips and debates about this social psychologist and personality psychologist about like is the environment more important or is the personality more important right but isn't yeah the environment is always changing at all times if you're moving and going outside yeah so social psychologists say like all personalities way over valued like it just changes all the time based on your context and personality psychologist every factor including the environment does not account for more than like 30% of the variable so nothing is a big you know whatever that's like a thousand small effects kind of thing um but uh but yeah so self-awareness is a huge part of that um one way to do it is to just take some of the tests so I actually have um I put together some of these is a download for uh for the book I think it's atomichabits.com slash personality that page has um has most of the like the higher the most well research personality tests on it they're three or four so if you want to take some of those you can I think some of them are free um so anyway so that's a decent starting point um but uh but yeah I mean this is I'm kind of uh toying with a new idea here when I talk about this about how to align your personality and your genes with your environment um for building better habits I haven't seen anybody talk about that before so we're kind of in new territory so I don't really know I don't know what the best way to approach it is um I think it's true uh and you can see it in many different areas that when people are in a situation where they're both well-suited which means their genes match the environment and they're well-trained which means they practice the habit saying a day out you get very remarkable results um you can get good results by being well-trained and not well-suited and you can get good results by being well-suited and not very well-trained so talented but you don't practice hard but if you want great results you kind of need both and how to best do that yeah this is a challenge yeah that's fascinating the the fact that you have to match your personality to the habits that you're trying to build it or even the career path that you're looking to get into uh and that's something that yeah I don't think I've ever I've never heard anybody talk about it but it's like because we get into too much of this like dreamy like idealistic version where we tell people you can do anything and like you said it's very easy with physical traits like you can't tell somebody who's five feet tall that they could be in the NBA because there's only probably two people that have ever done it and like statistically speaking yeah you're probably not going to be the third uh so you have to be a bit realistic right so there's a there's a strategy that I talk about in the book which is essentially the layering of skills that opens up options so if you um Scott Adams guy created the delvert comic he he has an example about this where he talks about you know I wasn't the best drawer uh wasn't the best cartoonist but I was pretty good I was saying the top like 25% tile um and I wasn't the funniest person that you would meet but I was pretty funny I was probably in the top like 25% tile there uh and I also had like some skills around business because he had worked in a management company and you know and stuff like that so he was like any any individual one of those traits would not have stood out but by layering them all together I developed this really interesting and unique thing and I think that you can see that in a lot of areas and it's particularly a powerful solution in in creative context so think about like Hamilton um it's a great story it would have made a good Broadway play if it was just normal um but because it's this amazing like wrap ballad as well uh it becomes this totally new incredible thing it was actually the combination of the two that made it like this world changing and I think that uh you can do that with your own personal skills as well you'd find to find out what the right combination is the right like recipe or layer of your talents are because most people have a few things that they're pretty good at even if you're not world class at them and how can you combine those in some kind of unique way that's much more compelling than what they would be alone yeah and I think there's something to be said in the Hamilton example about taking risks because that's a huge risk you're doing something that has maybe been he had been done only once before and by the little manual right like it's not very common that you can bring a hip hop to Broadway just didn't happen up until that point uh how do you face risks in life when you're putting your work out there is there uh do you find yourself taking risks with the content that you're putting out there that things that you're writing and the message that you're trying to deliver uh well I like the idea of risks that come and not seem to have a approach but I like things that have limited down sign it unbounded upside so um I know what the investment is uh at the beginning and um like a very easy example finance numbers make things like more uh easier to quantify and look at but if you were you know like an angel investor and you put $10,000 in to 10 different companies your loss is bounded you know exactly how much you will or won't lose at the at the most you're gonna lose that $100,000 or $10,000 for each company but if one of them becomes Airbnb or drop box or whatever well then it's an unbounded upside it could be it could be world-changing um it could be the next Uber um and again that's like a very cut and dry example because it's financial but I think you can kind of take risks like that creatively as well uh if nothing else you could have a bounded time scale for it you know you could say alright I'm gonna spend the next three months launching a podcast or creating a YouTube channel or you know like right for me one thing that I'm 21 right now I'm I have all these notes unconsciousness but it would become a risk for me to write about consciousness because my style is to be very actionable and practical and like I want people to be able to use stuff whereas this would be much more theoretical so maybe I take a risk or I say alright I'm just gonna spend three months I'm gonna write you know maybe 10 articles about consciousness and that'll be like my um that'll be my experiment and we'll see there's a little bit of a risk I'm gonna lose the time but there's also the possibility that maybe it'll blow up maybe it'll catch somebody's eye and it'll be like a totally new way to think about the problem um is there a worst case scenario there like is there a scenario where like people are like that's it I'm out of here James I'm not gonna read any of your shit anymore I feel like that maybe is like this fear in the back of our head that would never ever happen I mean you might lose a couple people yeah you're gonna lose a couple people every time you publish something I've come to the conclusion that it's impossible to send an email to 400,000 people and have everybody be happy it just did it can't I certainly cannot do it I don't know if anybody can yeah so people aren't gonna be happy it no matter what you send or some people will be upset but I do think I don't know I think that it's really how long do you run that experiment in my particular case that's the risk you know if I write about consciousness once well that's not gonna do anything people might just find it interesting to mix things up if I write about it for a month then maybe I'm starting to flirt a little bit with like okay someone doesn't care about this topic and I've got nady emails about it and it's kind of like well maybe maybe I don't want to listen to that anymore um so the longer you go the more you risk alienating the audience the the shorter it is maybe it's just like a fun interesting thing that you did do you worry at all about getting locked into just being the habit guy as somebody who talks about habits versus exploring different avenues and obviously you build up an audience that that comes to expect something from you but I guess they also will expect you to to if when you inject your personality and who you are into it I guess it can always be a bit original but there must be a little bit of a a push pole there we're like well I am interested in photography as well or whatever it is that you may be don't write about the short answer that is yes I mean I I'm very glad that the site is called jamesclear.com and not like better habits.com or something like that because it doesn't lock me in to that particular domain or that particular topic it's funny how that that works though right just the name of something will lock you in like you know what I mean if you you there's no flexibility or at least it seems strange to delve away from it because I guess a remit say he does that a bit too right his is like I will teach you to be rich and it was originally just about finance but then he kind of says no it's about living a rich life which can kind of is like a little bit of a twist on the original intention of it right but sometimes you can get stuck with those band names you came up with when you were 12 years old your brand can box you in a little bit I mean this is my friend shaman kp says like this like people are gonna put you in a box um they're gonna put you in box anyway because you need to to understand somebody it's like oh he is a police officer she is a teacher whatever like you need to wait to understand what someone does and you know what's interesting or useful to them or whatever like a box to put them in in your life branding allows you to define that box and so you can you have a little bit more control over like this is what I do on the youtuber i'm a podcast or i'm a writer i'm whatever and so that helps a little bit but I have very broad ranging interests and so I really resisted having something for a long time I still have this spreadsheet it's like 390 I think possible names for the site I'll domain names and stuff or whatever and I showed them to some friends and I whittled it down to a top 10 list and the feedback was pretty much unanimous they were like I don't really think any of these are great and I was like I don't either so I guess you know if Seth go insane is good enough for him or Oprah's name is good enough for like I'll just use my name and I'll figure it out later and I'm so kind of figuring it out later but I like the fact that it gives me some additional yeah I had the same thing where my I actually bought the domain minimalist filmmaker and I was going to be known as the minimalist filmmaker and I really like I was like well it kind of opens me up to two different things I could talk about like minimalism and filmmaking but it's still felt and because I felt like I needed that early on I felt like the branding was going to be the most important thing in terms of people remembering me and coming back to me or being able to go to my domain name after they heard about it and that ended up not being true at all and I thought my apostrophe in my name was going to really screw people up there and how am I going to do it so like none of that mattered because we're in a digital world where people find out about you online through a link they click on it and then they click subscribe and they find you so I do think it is important like you're branding and how you message yourself and how you you put yourself out there because that's obviously what separates you from everybody else but at the same time you don't want to be locked into something that maybe doesn't have flexibility the way that I think about it is that the work you do is your brand so if you want to be known for something then do great work about that thing and eventually you'll become known for it but I don't want to dismiss the value of having a good brand name or the value of doing something like that because it's you know one of my favorite examples of my friend Steve Cam here runs a cycle nerd fitness well it's about getting in shape but there's a lot tied up in that name because it's it's a really brilliant brand name because pretty much anybody can identify as a nerd like you can be a podcasting an audio nerd you can be a love legos you could be really into the marvel universe from Spider-Man you could love Star Wars you could be a nerd about cars or programming or there's like a million things but it doesn't feel that big when you're that person you just think about it it feels like small or you it feels like your and when you have a well-defined space like that I think it is a little bit easier to build an initial community because people have a reason to latch on to that if the right person comes across that box they're like oh yeah that's for me I should like you know I should climb in whereas if it's just you maybe the the startup cost is a little longer there the the curve is a little more shallow in the beginning because you have to build up a portfolio of work to represent that but I do think long-term whether you have the name or whether you go with your own name or whatever your work is what defines your brand yeah I completely agree I think you're right that in the very beginning it may help to to push the needle a little bit but over the course of if we're taking the long-term approach five years if your work's good enough eventually people are going to see it right if it's if it's in the top 10 percent and you're really just killing it whether it's film or writing you're probably going to get noticed yeah yeah it's hard I mean I the way that I've grown is by spending just as much time on strategy and marketing as I do on the content creation it's probably about 50 50 so I put a lot of work into trying to reach people but you know if you look at some really amazing examples Elon Musk is the ultimate example the reason everybody talks about Tesla and SpaceX is because the product itself is so amazing it's so amazing that you can't not talk about it and that should be really the goal of like any creators work is how do you create something so incredible that people can't not share it with somebody else and so in that way doing better work will people will kind of find it but I I always have I always have trouble trusting like if you build it they will come because I just like I really need to I feel like I need to push hard to reach people yeah well how does that work then because that's I feel like for my work I don't really focus too much on reach at this like how do I reach certain amount of people marketing like I guess I'm just not that good at it if anything you could say maybe creating a thumbnail and title is like I don't know if you put that in that camp I would put the title in I mean it's yeah copywriting is the title writing titles is probably you know people often say it's like 80% of the book or 80% of the article or whatever is the title very rarely people spend 80% of the but yeah I mean that's a marketing decision yeah so what is the 50% look like and where have you found the best ways to increase your reach with your content well the tricky part to that question is it changes over time because the the internet moves fast so like where I get my traffic from now is very different than where I got it from even two years ago there was a there's a block of time maybe like three years where I got a ton of traffic from Quora because they had this I would write articles on my site I don't do guest posts I publish everything on JamesCler.com first and then after it runs there sometimes I'll republish it on a different outlet or occasionally we apart in ships like time or entrepreneur or someplace like that they'll run it so I was republishing some of the articles I wrote on Quora and they had this like blog function where they would you could post it to the blog and then occasionally if the article did well on their platform they would email it out to all their users and so this was in the Quora email and they would email the version on their site but I would have links back to my website in the in the article there so I was getting a bunch of you know hundreds of thousands of visitors from them and then they deprecated that feature and got rid of it so just like you know managed overnight and stuff like that happens all the time where there's there's something interesting available right now and they won't be there in two or three years the big pillars that are still around Google you know has been around for a decade and probably will be around for another decade and some former fashion facebook is still for me it's a little different a lot of my friends get you know they'll get like 40 percent of their traffic from Facebook or something I don't it doesn't work for me that way we get 20 percent from social overall and Facebook is the largest of that social chunk and to break that down is this people that are going to your social accounts or these people that are just sharing your articles on their own or kind of a combination of both I don't know I don't I haven't put that much time into social so I don't have huge social following Twitter I'm over a hundred thousand Facebook's like 60 years 70 and then Instagram I don't really bother with things it's 20 or something I don't really post much there because I just I don't know it doesn't work as well for articles and ideas yeah but I think that it's mostly people who are already in my audience that are sharing it and then there people in their kind of secondary graph or network are coming across it and clicking those links and coming back to the site yeah because I was kind of I'm kind of wondering is like do we actually need to all have all these social media accounts in order to have it effectively spread because I think if people are going to find your article they're they're subscribed to your newsletter they really like it and find value in it if they're on Facebook they're going to share it with their friends on Facebook they don't need you to be sharing it to get that nudge they're actually these all these weird things where if you're on the consuming side they're all these habits like oh yeah every all all of my readers have Facebook accounts but if you're on the creating side it's like well maybe as the creator you don't even need one and same thing is true for emailing you know I mean emails the backbone of my business and the email newsletter is the best thing that I create and put out but I don't subscribe to any email newsletters so like if people did what I did I wouldn't have a business it's so weird yeah but part of that is just the the consequence of like to be the creator and to be the consumer to very different roles and so you need different habits to you know succeed in those different roles and you don't need to necessarily be a subscriber to newsletters to understand what a good newsletter is like we we're talking about the comparison and it's on a platform like YouTube it's easier than any other to be able to look at what other people do because you're constantly being fed thumbnails from other creators and you're like oh let me look at that and you're like oh shit they're way better than me but then it also gives you a you know that bar or something to at least strive for and maybe there's a push poll in terms of how it helps you or how it and that negatively affects you certainly I think is largely about how you're able to view it if you're able to look at it and admire the person for the work they do and not take it as a negative to where your skill set is but you don't have any comparison with with newsletters is that like a good thing about thing to see where the market is to understand how other people are doing it or you just like what what I'm doing seems to be working you bring up an interesting point I hadn't really thought about it this way but I think this is what's happening so if you're on the same platform if you're seeing the other YouTubers or if you're seeing the other podcast or whatever then there is some slight positive benefit because you get to see what is working for other people but if you're there's a huge negative benefit as well which is you're falling into this comparison trap all the time however you're only seeing strategies after they've already been employed so you're sort of seeing like best practices I guess we could call them but you're not really bringing anything new into the ecosystem from that particular vantage point now you might be able to bring it from something else for me with the newsletters so technically I run a blog and I have any minutes that are but most of my reading and consumption is from books and research studies so I'm actually bringing something from a different vertical into this like little ecosystem and I wonder if there's a benefit to that to like getting your sources outside of the same vertical that you create in and then you can like maybe spice things up and bring in a new angle that other people that hasn't like yet pervaded the platform that everybody's on yeah and that's like the creating of the Hamilton it's like you know lineman you all has this right crazy subset of skills and hip hop and then he combined that with the theater to bring it to a new platform it's yeah I think it's one of those things where if you want to do something different if you want to stand out then you can't just be recreating whatever everybody else is doing and people get into that trap all the time the most interesting ideas are often the intersection of different areas so I wrote an article on first principles thinking and this is usually how really amazing first principles thinking happen so there's a John Boy this famous military strategist and he gives this example of snowmobiling and so he says like you get a bicycle a military tank and a I think like a speedboat or a small boat with like just a single engine and those are the parts that you have to work with and what you can do is you can take the oh it was a boat with a jet ski behind it or like a pair of skis so what you can do is you take the skis and the motor from boat and you take the handlebars from the bike and you take the treads from the tank and you put them all together and you could build a snowmobile but it's only by like distilling down to those fundamental parts and then taking from like wildly different disciplines from the water and from land and from bicycling that you come up with this interesting novel solution and if you look throughout history it actually has happened this way multiple times so when Gutenberg created the printing press there were already printing materials and printing presses out there but there weren't any that could operate quickly and what he did was he took this like corkscrew mechanism from a winery and he added it with the little printing elements and was able to like create a press out of it that nobody had done before and so suddenly he could like printed scale and it ended up being you know one of the most important inventions of a modern society but he got it from a totally different area and so I think that's true both for like physical creation and probably digital creation and mental thought is like if you can draw upon ideas from different disciplines you can often come up with something much more meaningful or useful yeah and you don't have to reinvent it completely you just don't have to just don't copy somebody word for word or you know don't try to be somebody else infuse your own style and your own past experiences into what you're creating the yeah I mean this is a top conversation because you don't want to just play drives and copy what somebody else is working on but by and large I think people are far too they take far too much ownership over their ideas they don't realize how much they have been gifted from all the people who came before them so throughout history there have been a hundred and seven billion people or so and there are seven billion alive right now so the the quote from now Ferguson is a the historian he's like the dead out number the living 15 to one so all of those people that have lived throughout history they have all tried things and failed and tried differently and slowly learned along the way and homeed their you know occasionally they came across the solution that worked pretty much anything that you think you can come up with right now that's like this interesting solution somebody else probably already tried it and the best solutions get widely disseminated and you know all the things that you practice and get better at you can pass down to your children and so on and this is how humanity advances it's kind of this giant snowball of collective knowledge that's just like rolling down this endless hill picking up steam and you know picking up new ideas that goes long and in many ways the reason that modern society is where it is now is not because we are smarter than the people who came 10,000 years ago it's just because we have a bigger ledge to stand on when we were born you know like my I have a little niece she's two years old and when she was born she wasn't being taught the same stuff I was being taught in school she got the benefit of the last 25 or 30 years of knowledge that is now being taught to her and it's the same way you know on and on each year some of the things that we found out were wrong we stopped teaching and some other things that we learned were right we started adding and eventually this knowledge expands and my point here is that so much has been learned over the broad span of history it is very hard to have anything new to contribute to that and so if you think you're adding something new and interesting you're really probably only adding like the last one or two percent to that idea and that's if you come up with something compelling you know earlier we were talking about my idea of success is a matching problem and you need to match the genes to the environment well you know that's cool and that sounds like it's something now like came up with but really if we're being honest there's so much research about genetic code and about it like you know success and environments and that all that stuff has been talked about a thousand times and the only little thing that I added was like you know putting it together in some way or phrasing it in a way that was simpler easy to understand or something like that so how much credit should I really get for that idea um I don't know I think it's probably fairly minimal um is it do you think we should be early on copying other people maybe copy with credit because I know when I first started out I copied everybody like and like nobody was seeing my shit it's not like I was making money off of it so I think there's obviously a line where stealing somebody and profiting off of their work is wrong but I would see filmmakers that I admired and I'd be like oh cool I'm going to just recreate what they did and literally do a shitty version of what they did and I think that's important that's how we learn and that's how we grow is by like copying and by replicating with others have done and then eventually we need to stop looking at other people's stuff and just start creating for ourselves still as you know we are intentionally or unintentionally copying other people other people have influenced our work other people are our contributing to what we are creating whether we like it or not well I think there's a vein of humility that kind of runs through all of this you know I mean the point that I'm trying to make here with like there's this huge collective ball of knowledge that we all are benefiting from is that just don't take credit for give all the credit away you know I mean you're benefiting from a huge mass of the amount of knowledge that you just don't even think about each day but there's also this there's a speech given it was by this famous photographer he gave it as a graduation speech and he laid out this idea that he called the Helsinki bus station theory there's an article about it on my side if you want to read up the whole speech but his point was early on in your career especially as a creative it's kind of like you're at a bus station and everybody's on you know each creative each of your peers are kind of on a different bus you leave the station and some of the same buses go to the same stops as you go through the city and so you show up at a stop and they're like oh there was already a bus here that looked like that you know somebody's already been on this line and so people aren't respecting your work they're like oh that reminds me of someone so it looks like you're copying them you know what do you think about their work because this is it seems like they did it first and this continues for a few more stops as you continue to go but the further further along you get if you don't stop if you keep creating you get further out in the city and then there's only one or two other buses are there and it's like hey you know this person's already been here it looks like you've really even falling them for the first three years or five years your career but if you if you just don't give up at some point you get to a stop online that nobody else has been to it's like oh we haven't seen this before this is the bus hasn't come here this is new this is interesting and so what you need to do is stay on the bus and continue to work and then his argument is that once you make it to that point you actually you don't just get the interesting unique creative work that you make of air you regain the whole line because they're like oh you made this interesting thing what did you do before that and then like how did you get here you know what process did you follow what it was been the arc of your career and suddenly all that stuff that people said was an interesting before is now much more interesting and retrospect because of where it led you and so I think that the I think that's the right way to think about it in another way is that another point to that story you really need to to master the fundamentals of whatever your craft is before you can actually have a hope of producing something really compelling you know I mean in chess you need to know where all the pieces move on autopilot before you can advance to the next level of work or the next level strategy for the game and this is I I think this is true for any area habits in that way are the foundation for mastery because you have to be able to understand the fundamentals at like a habitual level at an automatic level and then use that as the foundation for the next level of performance and and the only way to do that is to learn from you know what are all the best practices right now what's everybody else doing where can I you know and and give credit along the way don't it's not you that came up with it but um but you have to master those fundamentals before you can produce something compelling anyway yeah it would be kind of a comical to pick up a guitar and then expect that you're gonna be able to just create original music without ever knowing any chords you know if you pick up a guitar you're struggling you're learning some basic chords you're usually trying to find some really simple songs that you can replicate because we learn from what others have done and I think that probably is true for every discipline whether it's you know writing a book figuring out how sentences are structured we have to take that approach where it's okay to learn from other people to copy other people and then eventually at some point we'll we'll be able to make something original for us I think that like I think you can make something original because as there have been you know what was a hundred billion hundred and seven yeah hundred and seven billion people there's Dr. Su said it there's nobody you were So there's always gonna be a touch of originality in what comes to it whether like if you're giving a speech if you're talking um your personality traits come out a little bit more in those kind of things if you're making a video uh even in writing it may be more subtle like a writing style in the long run maybe like a paragraph to paragraph you can compare two people but over the course of a book you can see the originality I think that's definitely true there there's a great quote from Martha Graham she's his famous choreographer she was talking to this woman Agnes de Mila I think was her name and she had she had worked on a variety of plays and done choreography that she thought was pretty great and then but it didn't get this like brought a claim and then she did the choreography for the Oklahoma famous bad Broadway play and it like blew up and she was talking and she's like you know I kind of in a weird way I kind of feel like quitting because it feels like my barometer for what is good work and what is bad work is totally off I did this stuff that I thought was good nobody cared about it I did this one thing that I thought was decent and it blew up and she looked around she said something to the effect of you have something inside of you that nobody else has and so if you don't create that the world would never get it again in any form and your job is not to judge the work your job is to create the work I think that's true for any creator there is some quality of uniqueness to whatever you're making if you allow to come out if you just copy and paste then it's not that's not the same thing but if you do allow yourself to show up and deliver it through whatever your unique lenses then yeah there's something that's irreplaceable about that my favorite thing I just realized is that you quote all these amazing inspirational people and then I think the only person I've quoted on this podcast is Dr. Sue just so I just that's where I get my information rounds go but let's do let's wrap up here with some quick questions they don't have to necessarily be quick answers so let's get them not good at that you've already looked at the rapid fire thing it's kind of tough but yeah you can answer as short or as long as you would like how do you get through doubt the short answer is time you know I mean I don't I I deal with doubt just like everybody else you know it's not like I'm able to escape it in some way the other answer that is feedback cycles so the more that I've experienced out and overcome it the more that I trust myself to be able to manage it again in the future so the if you think about it the more times you can experience out and work through it the better equipped you are for handling it later and I the one way to think about that is um if you live long enough life is going to come for you something's going to happen you know I mean when my parents from my age they had a daughter who had cancer and all kinds of other stuff they were dealing with so at that time they didn't need to find doubt it was just there for them but at other periods of time they things were rolling long smoothly and so when life doesn't challenge you you should probably challenge yourself whether that means pushing yourself physically or taking on a difficult creative project or you know living in the woods for a week or whatever there's a million ways to do this going to a silent meditation retreat but finding ways to challenge yourself things that you are doubtful that you might be able to handle probably better equipped you for whatever the next iteration is so it's almost like looking at your life and if you're not experiencing doubt as a creative then likely that you're probably in a bad place because you're probably not pushing yourself enough it's probably true you don't need it doesn't need to crippling or doesn't need to be everywhere but I think there should probably be why not for an hour a day you know I mean 23 hours your day are rolling long smoothly and you feel pretty good my little push yourself a little for an hour is there a universal skill or we could say habit that's most important for creators to learn so somebody who's looking to put out content build an audience and be able to make a living as a full-time creative or creator there are a couple things I could choose here like you know fitness exercise I think is a crucial one I don't think I'd be an entrepreneur without an exercise habit I don't think I'd be able to handle the psychological rollercoaster of it but the one that I usually pick is reading reading is sort of a meta habit that improves every other area of life whatever you're dealing with whatever you're working on you can read about it and find a solution to it and then do it better you know if you want to learn how to build a popular audience there a ton of marketing books on that if you want to learn how to meditate there books about that if you want to learn how to improve your marriage there books about that there's whatever problem or challenge you come across reading offers a solution and is reading does it is it do something different than watching a movie I'm not sure about the difference of how watching something sticks versus reading something sticks from like a memory standpoint but I do think that even when it comes to watching great documentaries video is largely designed for entertainment of some type whereas books especially nonfiction books or plenty of novels of course that are entertainment um even good documentaries don't really unpack like an idea in the same way that a book does you could read a book on you know you could watch a documentary on say like a fire and early retirement or something like that this whole movement of financial independence and saving a ton of money you probably that documentary would look something like interviewing some people who'd retired early and what their lifestyles are like and talking about like maybe the leaders of the movement what some of the bloggers are talking about things like that and that can be very inspiring for someone who has seen it but if you wanted to actually practice it a book would probably be the better format for unpacking like which stocks do you invest in and like how do you save consistently and what does that look like what should you know before you place the mortgage on your first house and like all that stuff um so I guess I will say that books are usually provided more actionable uh script for solving a problem and um but that doesn't mean the videos don't have value I think it's just they approach the problem differently yeah I think that you're right in that I think the key word is like entertain and that's usually what a medium like a film usually it needs to entertain and certainly engage you versus a book which can you can have dry dry periods you can't like skip over a part of a movie right but if like the author says all right the next bit is going to be dry so if you guys really don't want the nitty gritty details and skip ahead to page 45 or whatever um I think that's definitely uh a key probably is that the information that can be provided in a book is much more depth and much more rich I think videos probably lead with entertainment and follow with education whereas books probably lead with education and follow with entertainment right it's like a secondary goal yeah and I'm talking specifically about nonfiction here but I think the entertainment element is really important though right in creating oh it's strange when you're writing a story or writing a blog post and the like entertain is like maybe like it's it's probably the best word that we could come up with but it's not saying taking anything away from it it's just saying you're creating something that's really engaging that somebody enjoys to consume right and like that's got to be in everything you create what I find so from a reader standpoint the thing that really makes me a book doesn't have to be some you know whirlwind amazing story for me to want to read it if it's directly tied to a problem that I'm trying to solve in my life you know like I'm I'm really invested in a book if it's a problem that's important to me it doesn't have to be some amazing page turner so I think the relevance of the book to the reader makes a big difference there whereas you may not see a movie created like that that's super dry and you're just hoping that the audience will be really invested yeah what's the simplest advice that's the most important to follow hmm people love to talk about things that make the last 2% of difference in something so if you want to get in shape people talk about like what protein powder should I take you know what bar should I eat for lunch what knee sleeve should I get for the gym what weight lifting shoes are running shoes should I buy but all that stuff makes like the last 2% of difference the real answer if you want to get in shape is like don't miss a workout for 2 years and then get back to me and the same thing is true for so many areas of life you know like I I have this story that I tell in an atomic habit about this guy was salesman he was a stock broker and he ended up building the largest book of businesses firm and the way that he did it was he had two little jars on his desk and one of them had 120 paper clips in it and the other one was empty and he would come in in the morning and he would make a sales call and then he put a paper clip over and they'd hang the phone up and he'd do the same thing again until he did 120 sales calls a day and that was all he did all his other friends like the other peers in the office they were reading analyst reports and looking at the news and trying to fair what the hot stock picks were and all this stuff that wasn't related to the fundamental unit of measurement in that area which is are you making sales calls and I think that's true for so many things like it's the simplest advice is getting put in your reps that's all I would describe in just a single sentence put in your reps but it's so easy to forget and get distracted that's awesome man that is a great point to end this podcast thanks so
