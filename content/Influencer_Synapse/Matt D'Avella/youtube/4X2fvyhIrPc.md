## Transcript
 We're seeking bright influencers to represent our product to your subscribers. Just like to cooperate with you to advertise our black desk. Would you be interested in reviewing one of our wallets? So we know we've reached out to you a million times, but we're relentless about working with every influencer we possibly can. That really makes me feel special. Hi Matt, would you do a shout out for $300? At least they were upfront and honest about it. We need you to post promotions on your channel for us. We now have an amazing opportunity to offer you. Okay, so I think you get the point. So something interesting happens when you break around 100,000 subscribers on YouTube. You get a lot more emails. There are a lot of companies that are trying to get you to sell stuff for them. And this is a world that we are all very familiar with, but it was a perspective that I had never seen before. As users of social media were exposed to this world every day. hashtag add hashtag spawn. Sponsorships have infiltrated every corner of our digital lives. Advertisers call it native. When the content fits so perfectly with the platform that you can't tell the difference between a paid post or not. It's deal. Media companies and individual personalities are rewarded for this sleight of hand. Now it's hard to really blame them. It's difficult to make a living as a content creator. You work hard every day to make stuff for people. And most people aren't willing to exchange money for it. They expect it to be free. There are people that advertise ethically those who share and promote products that they use and those that add value to their lives. But if the majority of sponsored posts were honest, they would use the hashtag I did this for money. So I've gotten a peek behind the curtain into some of these deals. And largely what I see are companies trying to buy your attention. It's clear to me that they care more about my audience size than the message that I'm delivering. They simply want to use me to sell you shit. But I don't want to do that. But let's be real. I do need to make money to be able to continue to make videos and podcasts episodes every week. So I've decided to start a Patreon. There's really three things I want to achieve with this Patreon account. First it'll help keep my content advertisement free. Every week I make one podcast and at least one video and you'll continue to get this without interruption or distractions. I'll also invest in the future of my YouTube channel. I have some really ambitious ideas for documentaries that I want to create. I want to explore minimalism, travel the world capturing simple and tiny homes and higher crew to help make even more meaningful content. And finally I'll be using the Patreon as a premium membership platform so you can get access to exclusive content. This will give me a chance to get more intimate with the content I create through AMAs and vlogs. The vlogs will take a look into my process that I rarely reveal. If you can spare a few bucks every month, then it's going to go a really long way to helping me continue to make videos, advertisement free, which really, really excites me. If you head over to patreon.com slash Matt Diavella, I've already got one AMA podcast recorded and one vlog up and running. As always, thank you guys for watching, thank you for subscribing, and I'll see you soon.
