## Transcript
 A lot of people have said that Minimalism is dead, but that's just because they haven't seen it look this good I'm Matt Diabella and they call me the bad boy of Minimalism. No, they don't. Nobody calls you that I've been a minimalist for the past 10 years and while my bad boy reputation might often get called into question, there's no doubt that I keep my wardrobe really simple day in and day out I stick with the basics. The same t-shirt, same pants, same hoodie, same shoes and socks. All solid colors and almost no patterns. And while my style hasn't changed much over the past decade, I've been slowly tweaking what I wear, the brands that I go for and I've even added some new items to my closet. I know, crazy. So I want to share every last detail about my new and improved minimalist wardrobe. By the way, everything that I mentioned in this video will be linked in the description below. I don't get paid by any of these brands. I just want to be as helpful as possible since I know it's difficult finding quality recommendations and because I'm a bit obsessed with the details. Before we get into this week's video, I wanted to let you know that my YouTube course is now open for enrollment. I only opened up the course a couple times a year, so I wanted to make sure that you had an opportunity to join what you can. Have you ever wanted to start a YouTube channel but didn't know what step to take first? Or maybe you've already started one but feel totally stuck? That's why I created Master YouTube. It's the roadmap you need to start your channel, create original videos, and attract your first 1000 true fans and beyond. I'm giving you an inside look into how I operate my channel, my process when I create a video, and everything I wish I'd known as a brand new creative. So this is part of the writing process, right? This is like, this is really what happens. This course won't give you the secret to becoming an overnight success because there isn't one, but it will help you finally start your YouTube channel if you haven't already. And get your videos in front of the right audience with integrity. No clickbait tactics here. If you've ever watched a YouTube video and said to yourself, I want to do that but I don't know how this course is for you. So if you want to sign up, go to slowgrowth.com slash master YouTube or click the link in the description down below this video. Hope to see you there. One of the most common questions I've gotten in the comments over the years has been, where do you get your shirts? So when it comes to my minimalist wardrobe, I figured we should start there. So I have tried dozens of shirts over the years, but I keep coming back to the same exact one. Jay Cruz, broken in teeth. They provide a couple of different options for fit from classic to slim and tall. After some trial and error, I was able to dial in a size that feels like it's tailored to me. The three colors that I go with are white, leather gray, and evening storm. And I have seven in each color. My jeans are from Levi's, they are the 510 skinny fit flex in black. I've tried finding better quality jeans over the years, but these provide the best fit for me, and so I continue to reorder them once every year. So you might have seen a video that I made about these pants, and the fact that I wear them every day, and I almost never wash them. If you haven't seen it, you should check it out. It's not nearly as gross as it sounds. These need to be washed. I've also got a pair of chinos from country road that I almost never wear. This is one of those items that I wear, maybe once or twice a year to more formal events. I've got two pairs of shorts from a brain called new one in black and one in tan. I wear these all throughout the summer. When I did my first and only minimalist wardrobe video on this channel like five years ago, I had two sets of mesh shorts. Natalie absolutely hated them. They were, if I'm being honest, pretty ugly. But they worked. They suited me well, and they did the job. Recently, the elastic wore out, so I had to get a new set, and let me tell you, I found something good. I have five pairs of these shorts, and I wear them literally every single day, and they might be my favorite new piece of clothing that I purchased over the past few years. They're officially called the pacemaker liner list short. I got the seven inch length in black. I wear them to the gym, on hikes, to the grocery store, and around the house. They fit great, look good, and my favorite part, they have pockets. Inside each pocket, they have many pockets to hold my keys, phone, and air pod securely. 10 out of 10, I would definitely recommend these shorts. Nah, real quick question. I'm doing a video on my minimalist wardrobe. The old mesh shorts. Do you remember this? I try not to. What did you like about them? Ah, they're just like so un-stylish. Like, they're so baggy, they're really 90s. We swapped those out. We're happy with the new dress. Yeah, I like the new one. Great. Recently made a massive shift in my wardrobe and changed my hoodie. After years of sporting a basic gray zip hoodie, I decided to switch things up for a pullover hoodie from Lulu Lemon. This one is called the City Sweat Pullover. Oh, it's a cardigan, but thanks for noticing. For the color, I went with smoked spruce. The material is really nice. And yes, it's got pockets inside of pockets as well. So I don't have to worry about things falling out of my hoodie. How do we feel about the change from the gray zip to the green pullover? I think that was my idea. It was. Yeah, you told me you told me I was fossilizing. I think you can wear like a gray zip hoodie when you're like going in the gym, but the problem I have is you wearing it and it's like all bold up because like, Matt's had it like two years and then we're like going in a dinner. And I'm wearing heels. This hoodie is definitely one of my new favorite pieces of clothing and for sure I'm going to wear it every single day until Natalie starts hating it. So when it comes to putting together my wardrobe, there are three factors that I really consider above everything else. They would be fit quality and versatility. Price isn't as much of a factor because I am buying less clothes so I can invest more money into the clothes that I actually do buy. When it comes to the fit, every brand has different sizes. So a medium and one brand might not be the same in another. And so it really takes a lot of trial and error to get it right. Quality is pretty straightforward. There's a fall apart after you run it through the dryer a couple of times. I really want to make sure it lasts a very long time so that I don't have to repurchase it every couple of months or so. And lastly versatility, can I mix and match these clothes with different pairings and different outfits? That's why I don't have a lot of patterns. I don't have a lot of colors. Most of my clothes that I own can be mixed and matched and that makes it a lot easier for me to get out the door. I've got two everyday sneakers that I wear. First I've got a pair of black Nike sneakers. These are the Nike Revolution 6 next nature. They have about a million options online for black sneakers, but these work well for me. I sell out everyday choice. Second I recently got a pair of stand smiths. These white sneakers are so new that I can still wear them indoors. I like the white leather as they're much easier to keep clean and they pair well with almost all of my clothes. I also have a pair of brown boots from Jay Crew that I bought way back when I was living in New York, which at this point is like five or six years ago. I don't wear them very often, but they definitely come in handy during East Coast winners here in the US. So I'm glad I held onto them. You were already introduced to vacation match. This shirt comes out when the sun's out. It's the only pattern shirt I have, but it's becoming my staple for whenever I take time off work. I only wear it when I'm on vacation and it just really sets the vibe sets the tone. Let's everybody know around me. I'm not fucking around anymore. Technically I would be fucking around though because I'm on vacation, but you get the point. All right, so I want to give you a quick look at my spreadsheet. So anytime an item gets lost needs to be replaced. Maybe it's been worn out for a couple of years. I will go to this spreadsheet and I have everything I need to know about reordering. Alrighty, so this is the spreadsheet right here. On the left come I've got quantity. The number of items I have. So I've got 12 pairs of boxer briefs, five of these Lulu Lemon shorts. The item with the link to reorder and then I've got the brand, the style, the color as well as the size. A lot of times the tags get pulled off or on sneakers that get worn away and I forget that I'm attending the details, but at 10.5 in Nike and so it's really helpful to have all of this info handy to reorder. And when I want a reorder say I just go to the t-shirt, boom, I can just head over here to reorder the shirt. It's already got slim, medium plugged in. I've got a few button downs that I wear to fancy restaurants. I pulled these shirts out about as much as my tan chinos, so maybe a few times a year. They're definitely useful to have for those special occasions, but not in every day wear for me. And I have two of these waffle handlies from country road. They're super comfortable. I think they look good and they're great for cold weather. Considering the wild swings of weather here on the East Coast, I do have a few jackets to cover me from the rain to the snow to the cold. This navy Wallace and Barnes bomber gets the most use. Next up, I have an ultra light down jacket from Uniclo, definitely a clutch purchase. It keeps me warm and is great to travel with. It can literally roll up into a bag that you can fit in your hand. This jacket from Barber is a great waterproof option when it gets really cold out. And finally, this massive coat is the Nordic Field Parka from J-Cru, and it helps me get through the coldest of East Coast winters. These are a pair of sweatpants from Lulu Lemon called the city sweat jogger. I love wearing them on our long haul flights between the US and Australia. And yes, they also have pockets inside of pockets. I've got J-Cru's navy swim trunks, aka Swimmies, aka just a bathing suit, really. Not much to say about them. Oh yeah, I almost forgot to mention socks and underwear. I have 12 pairs of socks from J-Cru and 12 pairs of boxer briefs from Everlane. All black, everything. And finally, let's wrap up my wardrobe with some accessories. I've got a casual everyday belt that I never wear and probably should downsize at this point. These are my Ray Band sunglasses that I've had for the past eight years, and they've held up surprisingly well. And these are my glasses that I got from Oscar Wiley, another Australian brand, a similar brand here in the US that I've used in the past is Warby Parker. You might have seen in my last video that I recently got an Apple watch. I went with the 45 millimeter midnight aluminum case with the midnight leather link. Super classic minimalist works for me. Believe it or not, this is my first ever smart watch, and I'm going to be honest, it's actually surprised me with how much I like it. I've got a lot of content planned and some digital minimalism experiments coming up so stay tuned for those. I have a cashmere bini from J-Cru. That's definitely one of my favorite items, not cheap, but it's so comfortable that it's worth the investment. And finally, I've got a 47 brand Yankees hat. Got to support the Yankees even if they let me down every single year. So when it comes to my minimalist wardrobe, it's not about owning as few items as possible. It's about using everything that I own. And so when you look at my drawers, when you look at my closet, I can say with confidence that I use 95% of the clothes that I own on a yearly basis. And now having a minimalist wardrobe for me what it really means is that I can get out the door a lot quicker. I can worry much less about what I'm wearing. I can feel more confident in all of the clothes that I wear and all of the clothes that I own because I've been really intentional about each piece. And so if you're looking to simplify your wardrobe, I hope this video gave you a little bit of inspiration into taking action. Thanks for watching and I'll see you soon.
