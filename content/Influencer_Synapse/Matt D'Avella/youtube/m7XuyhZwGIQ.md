I filmed this just minutes after I found out that The Rock tweeted at me. Pardon the audio quality as it's coming straight from my camera ü§∑.

One year of trying to get The Rock on my podcast and we finally broke through the noise. Thanks to everyone who has tweeted at @therock on my behalf. We did this the right way. No bots. No algorithm trickery. No spam. I'm so excited to continue this journey with you all and finally land The Rock on my podcast!!

One small tweet for man. One giant leap for Matt's podcast.
