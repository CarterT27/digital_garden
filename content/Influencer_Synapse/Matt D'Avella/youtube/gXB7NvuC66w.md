## Transcript
 There was certain points where I was ready to give up and someone, it's weird, someone would hit me up and be like, hey, do you want to do this thing for a couple hundred bucks or like 500 bucks or a thousand bucks and it would keep me going? I mean, what really kept me going was how I got my first camera. I couldn't afford a camera, I really wanted to get a camera and I was in Las Vegas visiting my aunt and if you've ever been to Las Vegas, you know there's slot machines everywhere, even in like 7-11 sort of like gas stations and she gave me some money to walk to, I think it was a mobile gas station, I can't remember the gas station and there were some slots in there and when I walked in I noticed this lady playing on the slot and she like moved over to this next slot and I had a little bit of change left after getting what my aunt wanted and I put it in a slot machine and I won four grand and at that time there was the biggest camera show I think in the states was in town and I went right over there and I bought a camera, I bought my first camera, and that kept me going over the years and months where I was ready to give up but I'm like, no, I think I'm meant to do this, I think I'm meant to do this and that's what kept me going. It's just like who does that happen to? You know, I've never won anything in Las Vegas and all of a sudden I want enough just to cover what I wanted on a camera and lens kit. That's pretty crazy.
