After getting back from a recent trip to Maui I've been thinking a lot about travel. Three years ago I never left the country. I didn't even own a passport.

Since I made room in my budget for travel I've made over a dozen trips to different places around the world. I wouldn't say that I travel a ton, and truth be told I prefer to spend most days in my home city, but travel is a place for me to recharge & get inspiration.

## Transcript
 I never had much money for travel. Graduating with six figures in student loan debt, buying a brand new car, and other poor decisions with money didn't help. But once I got straight with my priorities, when I realized what I really wanted out of life, things started to click. I began to chip away at my debt, paying off my car loan and making room in my budget for travel. What I've come to learn is that travel actually doesn't have to be expensive, or at least it doesn't have to feel expensive. The problem is that for most of us, our budget gets swallowed up by other things before we even start to plan our trip. When you spend less money on clothes and cars, when you stop living outside your means, when you stop ordering that thing from Amazon that's so important that you need it in one day, you start to save more. And from there, you have a choice. You've got a choice about how to spend your money and where to spend your time.
