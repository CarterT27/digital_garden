within this episode takes a very quick and very unexpected turn towards the metaphysical not completely unwelcome one as I'd consider myself an aspiring meditator but at heart I'm still a skeptic

support and helping to build this thing and with all that said what do you say we get to the podcast this is Jordan Taylor right you're listening to the ground up show a podcast that inspires creatives to make meaningful content and pursue their passions my name is mattheavella and I'm a filmmaker best known for the Netflix documentary minimalism and I'm sitting down with creators to talk about their process the lessons they've learned and how to make an impact you ever shoot a video and then forget to hit record one time what happened I think I fibbed and said that it actually got deleted that's genius it's more maniacal than genius but yes yeah I mean honestly that is like it's heartbreaking though for you when you go back to when you're like the numbers and you're like oh shit just means it wasn't meant to be just wasn't worth it yeah I didn't have the the opportunity to do that with mine because I was shooting like a reality show for E oh yeah I didn't I wasn't the editor it was her taught you something oh my god absolutely just like gut wrenching and just realizing in the I realized in the moment that I didn't get it and I didn't say anything because it's a reality show much as they kind of scripted it and staged it it also there were moments that could only be taken once and that was one of those moments and I was like okay I guess I'm never going to work with these guys again yeah exactly cool man well thank you so much for coming on happy to be here thank you for having yeah excited to have you here for people who may not have heard of your work you want to give me a little bit of background especially about what you've been up to lately my name is Jordan Taylor right I own a production company called Taylor Cut Films and I guess at this current point of time we are creating short films commercials TV shows this original content that that we really enjoy making and I guess a brief background about me I started I guess stabbling photography and videography when I was in high school took a production cast when I was a freshman and realized that I loved the medium of storytelling in general but then really resonated with filmmaking growing up watching Disney movies and things of that nature was kind of my my calling it's like oh this is able to emotionally affect me in such a dramatic and positive way and it kind of shaped it the way I it shaped the way I saw the world so then I knew that's what I wanted to do at a really young age which was a blessing for sure because that kind of steered my heart in the direction of where I am today and then kind of fulfilled that was a film major in school and then when I graduated I was working at the Food Network shooting for man versus food in different like food companies like that and then that wasn't creatively satisfying me as much as I enjoyed working that kind of like nine to five job and the weekends I realized I'm music kind of what drove me visually the most so when I would hear a song I would picture visuals like I'm sure most people do and which I'm almost positive what musical artists do as well is when they're making a song they're trying to convey whatever emotion story they're trying to tell and I just really resonated with that's one of the week and I would go to different concert venues and look up different artists that I thought were amazing kind of up and coming and I would just make friends with bouncers go into the concert hall and then I would film the show go up to the manager at the end and say hey I'm going to make a really cool recap of the concert and if you want to use it you can you don't have to pay me at all just if you don't mind saying Taylor could film made it and I realize that a young age that I wanted to disassociate myself as Jordan from my work because it wasn't about me it wasn't about the ego is like I wanted to create that's why I came up with Taylor could film I just wanted to create like an entity where place was like I can create my content that had nothing to do with me that had to do with kind of the soul or the message that was going along with it and luckily it caught the eye of some artists that really liked the music and I ended up touring with this artist named Chris cab who was signed to Ferrell at the time he toured an open for teapain and gym class heroes I was the first tour and it of quitting my job working at the food network I just knew that that excited me more and I wanted to do that so I loved it and jumped at the first opportunity I got to kind of do that and then that led to me making show recap videos and in it up leading to catching the tension of a producer and L.A. who asked me to film Usher who was in town a new work starring an off-road way show I filmed him for four days and when you connect with someone or you vibe with someone you feel it right away and we kind of just really vibe to that point in time and love this personality he loved my personality he loved my personality of course I loved his artistic approach on everything he's an amazing artist and he really valued my outlook as well and we just connected and literally after the four days he was like what are you doing and you want to come to Vegas to do the billboard awards and it was like I love to and then he was like what are you doing after that we got London we have an MX and stage thing like I love to do that and then that's actually fun I just realize that because now I create the content for MX platinum as well so it's a nice little circle so I toured with him for three years and went from doing BTS to doing you know his tour content his social media to photos to album artwork to like whatever was needed and just being learning how to just open up my mind creativity and also just following my heart and just realizing that anything that resonated with my heart like learning that regardless of what outsiders may think of what I'm creating that just as long as you follow what you love it or end up leading to an abundance or success and that's kind of how I'm here today having this amazing conversation with you in this room. Yeah it's amazing how those opportunities are so fleeting and to drop one of those paths to pursue another is a huge thing and I'm sure it's something that it's not an easy decision because especially a lot of those sounded guaranteed like hey this is a good living. I think the older you get or just the more experience you get or the more you trust yourself the more you realize that there is only one path and the one path is your heart and what you love and you may veer from the path every once in a while and you forgetting to hit record on something the universe might be like no no no no no and put you back into the path that you're meant to be but yeah I to me it wasn't ever like you know once you start operating from your brain more than your heart it's usually when you become less successful or you start veering away from what you're true calling is which is always trust your heart or your heart more so and just whatever you really love and that kind of leads you in the direction of where you're supposed to be and it's and today's day and age especially with social media it's very difficult to I guess you start trying to obtain likes or try to obtain success in a monetary value and a very superficial value and as long as you can allow yourself to realize that the reason why you have followers is because you you follow your heart in the first place so the reason why you have success is because you follow your heart in the first place and allow that to be kind of your your navigator then life becomes way easier I've luckily like meditate often now and I live in a state of meditation I teach meditation and learning how to like separate yourself from your thoughts and just being able to align yourself to just what feels right and observe then you can operate at a much higher frequency and then you can be able to make all the you know I've been making decisions at that point you're just observing you manifesting your life because you're just living from a space of love and then it kind of just puts you in the right opportunities there's no way I could know what I've been sitting here talking with you a week ago even if I tried to plan it it just said it aligns in every opportunity that you that kind of happened just like the art of saying yes or the art of being it's just things are presented into your life for a reason so trust that and trust if it feels good if it feels good then usually say yes or girl is if how scary or how off-putting it may be even if it's not currently aligned with your life maybe there's a reason why it's happening there's always a reason why it's happening so yeah everybody tries to plan ahead for the future they if you've got a business you create a business plan you know if you're starting a podcast you're trying to figure out okay where is this going to go in 10 episodes 15 episodes they try to create a structure because it provides some uncertainty yeah but as we both know you have no idea what opportunity is going to come a year from now let alone two weeks from now it's also then planning or living to future for it is just removing all the amazing opportunities that may be there in the future so if you're if I said right now like a year from now I'm going to be living in Bali shooting a movie even though you really want to do that you're now taking all the infinite possibilities that could exist from a year from now and isolating it to one thing and we're ever changing we're ever growing and same with the universe and same with everyone else in it so the ability to not be to past because if you think about there's a saying if you think about the past you if you live in the past you're going to be in a state of depression if you think about the future you're going to live in a state of anxiety if you live in the now you're going to be happy but it's more so the concept of time in general the past is a story we tell ourselves it's not there if we continue to live in the past and think about it then that's what we're bringing into the now and then if we start to think about the future it's just we're just projecting a possibility of what we wish to happen so allowing yourself to know that all there is is now and then living in that now and learning how to place yourself in that now and then just be the observer of now and not try to make any decisions because we can't control anything it's very humbling and you have to allow yourself to remove your ego and just say hey I am the observer of this life which is a blessing and I get to feel everything that's in it and there's a higher being and there's a higher purpose for me being here as long as I'm operating from a heart space of love then everything will then align me in that and everything good that's ever happened in my life has come from my surrender of my ego of saying hey me is Jordan I don't know anything I can observe everything and then I can take it in and feel it and process it and put it into my heart and know that from these experiences this isn't what makes me feel good and this is what makes me feel good that's all it is is just allowing that to be experiences and feelings and then next time you're in a situation you can be like oh this feels like that bad situation that I was in now I know that my heart should take me this way and then just operating from that and it's awesome because then infinite opportunities that come from that and it's always good so yeah so my expectations heading into this interview where that it was going to be pretty tightly confined to to filmmaking and that journey I didn't know about this journey of your life and I'm really curious about it I've had a similar one myself it's not I came across the power of now like a lot of people and got me to think more deeply about living in the moment and you know just like you said about kind of you're trying to or not trying to if you're meditating to let go of the past and let go of the future when did that journey start for you when did you first start to think about this I think so I study psychology I study psychology in school as well as film and I wanted to be a psychologist because I and to me the process of filmmaking whether the filmmaker is cognitive or not of it is the process of psychology it's your you're working out your thoughts and your own brain and you have this vision of what's happening and now you're putting it into a medium the same with like writing or the same with art so I think I've always been very aware of my thoughts and then I studied it so I've always been like the observer of my thoughts and always have understood I've always asked so many questions is like I'm sad why am I sad oh I'm sad because my you know my dad said something mean to me or why did you say something mean to me oh because his dad and love him fully oh because his dad and then you're able to really get to the root of it and then you go well these feelings have nothing to do with me and your feelings at this exact moment in time are not the same feelings two minutes ago and they're not the same feelings that are going to be two minutes from now so the art of meditating the art of living in the now is you can for me what helps is visualizing so I almost when I start to feel like a rush of emotions and I realize that my thoughts are cloudy I can visualize as like sitting at the edge of a bank of a river and then as the river is going past those are my thoughts and I can observe my thoughts going past and then you can identify them you can be like well that's sadness that's anxiety that's anger and then you can say but why then you can realize the more and tune you become with yourself and it's the combination of your mind body and spirit your body as well whatever we're not processing in our mind we're manifesting in our bodies so if your right calf is sore being like why is my right calf sore right side has to do with your masculine and your left side has to do with your feminine and your calves or your second heart so if your heart if your right calf is sore maybe you're dealing something with your father or you're dealing something with your masculine that you have in process yet and allowing yourself to foam roll it or be in tune or just allow yourself to be the master of yourself and then step away from your thoughts and the more you practice that like you said it is a practice like the practice of meditation is learning how to relax everything so when you're sitting still you know someone can be like okay relax but then you're thinking about relaxing so how do you remove the thought process behind that so say you're sitting there and then all of a sudden you're like okay relax my knees now relax my calves now relax my my shins and all of a sudden you can relax everything but then you can start to feel where you're holding tension and feel why you're holding tension there and then that constant practice and knowing why you're thinking certain things allows you to kind of be more in tune with all of that and to answer I guess your bigger question of when that kind of started I think I went more down this spiritual journey I'd say like a month and a half ago because I was my mom's Jewish my dad's calf like they divorced at 10 my mom was bar missed foot my mom tried to raise me Jewish because that's how she was brought up my dad tried to raise me calf like when I was with him and instinctively I was like I don't believe in God I don't want to deal with any of this I just would whatever and then I think about a month and a half ago or more I started to realize that not that I necessarily believe in a specific God but I believe that we are all part of a higher consciousness as humans and we are all connected by a higher consciousness that we actually all share the same consciousness that we are like high-van and was like dolphins dolphins all are telepathic they all share one collective consciousness they operate on the fifth dimension we operate on the third or fourth dimension and you are allowing yourself to realize that all these daily coincidences that happen aren't coincidences that you actively manifesting it sitting here and being like oh we're both from Jersey you know you feel that's funny and then you could just go about your day or you can be like oh well maybe there's a reason why we're both from Jersey and we're both sitting here right now and we're both having this conversation maybe we both need to have this conversation right now at this point in time and it's for our higher being and it allows us after this conversation to be like maybe I'll implement some of the things that we're talking about and that allow me to be the greater purpose of who I am but yeah there's some phenomenal books like you were saying or like the cellicine prophecy and there's some books that I've read that like really just touch on that to allow humans to start to be aware that you are actively manifesting your own life the words you say are you bringing into fruition so if you're sitting here and you accidentally like something good happens in your life and you go oh that's crazy that's insane it's like why are you saying to those words mean crazy is by definition meaning that something is wrong with you and saying is like the government or the society's way of saying that you are not in the right headspace but it's like why so like learning to say things or like instead of saying I'm trying to do this saying I'm doing this because you are by the very means of you speaking it means you're doing it so just being very cognizant of your thoughts and why you're saying certain things it helps you really start to isolate the art of being the art of just being aware of every second that's happening like feeling the wind feels just like because why not why would you not want to be in the now always and I understand it's like an active practice and it's difficult especially today's day and age with like social media and ADD which is really nothing it just means we're all if you have ADD or ADHD means you're really hyper aware and hyper empathetic and you can feel a lot of different things that once but rather than giving someone medication or telling them that there's something wrong with them allow them to be like well why don't you sit and you figure out what your creative outlet is what makes you feel what makes your heart feel listening to music does that make you feel does it just writing your thoughts down does that make you feel does this speaking with people you know so there's different ways to really and tune yourself and I'm hoping from this dialogue that we're having or just dialogue that we have in general with each other to allow ourselves to realize that we are all the same and we are all beautiful and to not allow any labels to kind of dictate other than that so like gender you're born and all of a sudden you're like man female like from birth pink blue it's like what why we're human that's all we're creatures we're equally as connected to the the plants as we are with each other you know we're 70% water the earth is 70% water that's just a random coincidence like humans on the giant universal spectrum of how long we've been here in the cosmic universe we've been here for like maybe a second on the cosmic calendar dinosaur is existed way longer than us when extinct humans are going to be the fifth math that mass extinction if we continue to just drain all our resources and pretend that money drives everything we get so like it's important I think now and it's time specifically to become and tune with that and be like oh maybe we should slow down and realize what we're focusing on because it's really important yeah I think there's a couple of things there one like the labels thing I think is a is a good conversation and it's one of those ones that I grapple with and conversations I've had on this podcast before because there is an element to labeling and you call it branding online that's actually it's positive and it's helpful to help push yourself forward because if I went to your website and you said that you're a filmmaker or photographer and I'll show you. Next in okay I know what they do I know what to expect from this website like if you just had some arbitrary name it may be more challenging or more difficult that's the same for me. You know like you were trying to fit into boxes for who? so other people can understand it's like we were never meant to fit in boxes and the first place why do you think the dawn of the Internet happened or starting to realize that I am not one thing if I want to right a cookbook if I want to be a fitness instructor I could be a fitness instructor if I'm a singer I could be a singer if I want to make YouTube videos and write a TV series I can do the same I think we've been taught at a very young age that you're one thing in order for people to comprehend and process it and I don't know why let's look at movies or acting someone plays one role in all of a sudden as a society we feel comfortable being like that's the funny guy you know like I'm going to use Jonah Hill he is super versatile as an actor and all of a sudden you see him and super bad you think he's one thing and then you see him in money ball he's another thing and that just goes to show as like a larger concept we are all everything literally we are the air we are the like the big bang happened it exploded created all of us and we are continuing to expand from that we are equally as much of the trees as the trees are us oxygen and we bring it like it's all it's all meant for a reason you know and everything happens for a reason and we're all connected for a reason so the more we try to put things into boxes so our tiny human brains can comprehend it is super limiting we got to stop trying to understand everything ask big questions without trying to know the answers because even if you receive the answers know that you wouldn't understand them at that just allow yourself to listen to yourself to observe and the more you're able to surrender the more vast and magical life becomes because then you no longer feel like oh I need to understand that you don't need to understand that it's okay you don't need to be one thing you don't need anything want stuff want to love want to feel good want to connect with other people and if that's your driving force then life becomes way more open you could be a boy and a girl you are a boy in a girl we are equally masculine as we are feminine I don't know when that ever started in society even if you look into the Roman Empire it's like the Alexander the Great and Egypt like these these diities that had both masculine and feminine properties were worshipped they were almost feared because like I don't understand how are they able to be in tune with both it's because we are everything and as scary as that may be to some people it's beautiful at the same time the less labels the less boxes the less trying to fit into societal standards the better and it's starting to become like that it's because there's a reason why the world is the way it is right now there's a reason why Donald Trump is present there's a reason because we went from going specifically in America we went from going to having the first African American president in a country that had slavery not too long ago at all like hundreds of years ago think of how long the earth has been here hundreds of years ago we had slaves human slaves and then he became president and then all of a sudden there was an outlash from that so there's the Ying and the Ying always so we are the most progressive we've ever been as a human society so there's also now the pushback from that but as long as you are consciously aware of the fact that all you can do is be the best version of yourself so then you can be the best mirror reflection onto other people it eliminates the notion of control and then you're able to then live in a very pleasant place and all you're going to see in your day-to-day life is beauty if you're living from a place of love all you will ever see is love because that's how it works we're projecting our reality as we're living it so I think it's beautiful to kind of just live from that space and realize I know nothing I control nothing but that is amazing that's why I'm here on this planet at this point in time is to just observe all the beauty that there is I'm curious how all of this spirituality influences your work because your work is very commercial and you work with a lot of big brands and companies which some might see as anathetical to spirituality if you're removing your spirituality from it yeah but I feel like the most and obviously the most and to and I've ever been so I can't necessarily quote on my work that I used to do because obviously I was driven from a place of fear of monetary achievement so I wanted to make money because I thought that's what equated to success but even if you look at I just posted a Tiffany video that I made today even though I'm not a complete alignment of what Tiffany stands for and who they are when they ask if I can make a video for them it's the story first I did a story about a daughter and a mother who it's a flashback and the mother gives the daughter earrings and then you see her eyes swell up and then what that moment meant to her and it pulls out of a picture frame and then it sees a list of sitting there I kiss her in the head I go and get those earrings and by me giving those earrings to her it allows her to refill what she felt like it's not this isn't what actually happened but it allows her to feel what her mother gave her when she had earrings so I'm still seeing the message of love and memories it's just now I'm able to take it and contextualize it into a specific product or what that product or what that message is trying to be I've never I don't diminish my values based on a company and if they don't they don't like what my message is which is love and positivity and empowerment and magic and being able to think creatively then I don't post it or I don't work with them so you know if it's bow is it's the same like when you put on the headphones and you turn on the music your world transforms and all of a sudden you're now outside and there's forest and you're able to explore because that's what music does when you put on headphones and you're walking on the street why are you doing it you're doing it in order to have a scape as an order for you to feel like that there's more to this day to day grind that you may be experiencing I always put my self and my creativity into everything that I do more so now I'm really focusing on original films and telling the true story that I've always wanted to tell and that I like to tell and but like spirituality helps with my creativity I Jordan isn't creative I'm a conduit for whatever higher message is coming through me when a dancer is dancing do you think they're thinking about the number that then you do do you think they're like one, two, four as soon as you start thinking there there go your flow is gone so it's the art of not thinking when I'm editing I'm not thinking I'm flowing and I'm channeling so the more in tune I am with the fact that I'm not here and I'm not controlling that process I'm allowing myself to be a conduit for that the greater my art gets and I hopefully it's a reflection of that and all the stuff that we're putting out in 2018 is just original messages and pieces of work that are going to live in a place that aren't that isn't controlled by big corporations and big companies we're going to have a live on a space that is completely our own and really spread the message of love and imagination and freedom and safety and empowerment and allow people to be like hey you don't have to go on YouTube or something and watch based on an algorithm of video that isn't aligned with how you're feeling we have a duty of responsibilities special people with followers to be preaching a message of empowerment and love and equality to the people consuming especially the younger generation now if they're going to grow up thinking oh my god I crashed my Lamborghini as the title of a YouTube video and all they want is to get a Lamborghini and drive it fast for no reason what message is that so being able to really be in tune with what you're saying regardless if it gets views or not that's very important and that's regardless of how commercial my stuff is I just think it's more of the universe saying hey here's some monetary reward for you continuing to operate from a place of love because I'm always putting my message of love and imagination to everything that I do regardless of who it's for so yeah it's absolutely something that I encourage all filmmakers and creatives to do which isn't easy but it's to turn your art and your passion into a business and to make money because it doesn't matter how good you are at a specific skill if you can't make money doing it you're not going to be able to continue doing it I think it's a reverse I think if you continue to make your art money will come from it if your if your money focused you're never going to be successful yeah I don't think that you need to be money focused but you need to understand how to make a living from it because I certainly know filmmakers that are more talented than me that inspired me early on that didn't know how to turn it into a business and now they're working a nine to five jobs probably just don't trust themselves to put a hundred of percent of themselves into it it just means that they're putting 20 percent of themselves into their fame filmmaking and then being suppressed by thinking that they need to be working at a nine to five job. If you quit your job and focus a hundred percent on your attention on what you love to do regardless of how much money you have you will be successful and I promise you that it's taking the leap it's taking the leap of faith you have to do it you're you're taking a leap of faith by paying to buy camera equipment that you may not be able to afford right now and working and interviewing people that you you think are spreading a good message and you're operating from a heart space of that then you will be rewarded for that but the more you make decisions separate from I love to do this the least successful you're going to be and you may start to like get some monetary success here and there because you are operating 50 percent out of love but you're only going to get 50 percent reward back from that and then you can go ahead and say but what about people like Donald Trump that a millions of dollars that obviously aren't coming from a place of love but then also try to think of what the definition of success is because if you think he's successful then you have a very skewed perception of what life is. If you think living absolutely miserable and never seeing love before in your life he's never seen love before in his entire life his dad never loved him he was never loved he doesn't know what love looks like and he's operating out of that space so he has money and he has power but what does he really have? he's going to be scared to die alone he's going to be terrified of the life he's I know he doesn't like the life he's living you could see it so it's about learning that you have to live from a place of love and if you live from a place of love you will only experience love in your life if you live from a place of fear you're going to experience fear so it's really about just committing to your art and your love and just putting 100% of yourself into it because anything good I've ever got in in my life is because I've regardless of what the outcome may be I'm like I know this feels good so I'm going to do it and then luckily I've been blessed with success from it and whenever baby if it's followers money working with companies or famous people or whatever whatever you consider success I just consider it like I get to make art with people that I love that's the coolest thing there is so I get to continue to do that every day because that's what I make my intention every day I'm going to spread the message of love today through making videos or writing or speaking or whatever it may be and then cool stuff comes from that what advice would you give to those people who find themselves stuck or pursuing their path their art and they're really struggling because there's a lot of people I just talked to Brian Bowen who he's been a photographer for 20 years now he's incredibly successful now but for the first 10 years it was struggle and there was no money there were no jobs he was honing his skill and trying to figure out how to make his way into this years when it's really tough the money isn't coming the love isn't coming how do you get by how do you get through learn how to find love within yourself for some reason that's taboo in society but if you don't love yourself 100 you are unable to love anything else a hundred percent that goes with everything if you're in a romantic relationship with a partner you can't give a hundred percent love to that person that relationship won't flourish if you don't have a hundred percent love in yourself so learning how to love yourself fully and if you're not getting the success or whatever you think you're supposed to get from it take a step back be like why? why don't I love myself why don't I feel love at night when I'm about to go to bed alone why don't I feel love? what's happening? do I feel fear before I go to bed? what am I feeling? and just being really brutally in tune with yourself be like oh do I want my parents love like why? why do I feel this emptiness why do I feel this hollowness? what can fill that hollowness? that is not superficial allowing myself to realize that I am a part of everything in this universe and we are all connected and that is beautiful and maybe I can go and meet some random person on the street and have an interaction that will really be substantial to my day or maybe I can give something back to someone that really feels amazing it just like and that's why meditating really helped me because it allowed me to remove my ego from my thoughts because I am not my thoughts and it allowed me to really become super clear and centered with who I am and say okay I am at the core I am this and I was of course I felt hollowness and emptiness and I felt creative stuck in my creativity we all go through that but then realizing I am not that I am not going to feel that and now we are from now and now we are from now because I see this sadness and I am choosing to make it love I am choosing to be like okay I see this sadness but it is not me so I am going to choose to take this emotion and make it into love and today I am going to operate only from love I am going to feel the grass under my feet I am going to go in the ocean today I am going to do that today because I love then obviously your perspective completely changes what was I upset about if you continue to think about the things I make you upset you are going to be upset forever we have the power to control our thoughts regardless of what I have to pay bills you don't have to pay bills of course there is repercussions that come from that but if you allow yourself to remove yourself from thinking about paying bills and today I am going to focus right this second I am going to focus on the things I make me happy all of a sudden a path starts to appear even if it is a tiny path being like oh wait I just met someone that really feels right and this is leading me in a direction that is leading in this or just give yourself the time to really just feel absolute love for yourself and we all know what we love you can ask someone like what do you want to do because we are taught at such a young age that there is like things like you are a singer you are an engineer, you are an actor we take tests, you are in the 10th percent you are in the four don't believe that it is like living in the matrix I am plugged for the matrix for like two seconds and plug yourself and be like I know what I love because we know what the feeling of love feels like and just tap into that feeling whether it is being in the sun whether it is writing down your words whether it is singing a song maybe literally anything in the world it could be something that is not even invented yet just allow yourself to be like this feels like love I am going to keep going in that direction and once you give yourself the time to do that your perspective changes immediately so it is cool I want to talk about the craft of filmmaking your films are gorgeous and there was a progression to get there some of the archive and I found your old video page and some of these old videos it was nostalgic to me because it reminded me a lot of the kind of videos that I was making when I was getting started at college and playing around with visual effects and using Andrew Cramer's tutorials and really trying to delve into the craft and become better and I am sure at the time early on we both looked at our videos and were like these are dope and I want to show them something yeah a lot of times especially when you finish it and then a couple years go by and you look at it again and you're like and I think you can continually have these feelings where you look back at your old work and you're like that represents too much it represents that time but honestly I'm not like I wouldn't put that in my reel I'm proud of everything I've ever done because everything I've ever done now obviously you progressively grow I'd like to think that everyone is progressively growing if you allow yourself to progressively grow but yeah it's just really understanding all you can do is understand yourself better so I was trying to channel and tell a story that I didn't know when I'm 18 and I didn't know myself I didn't know anything I was trying so hard to think and I knew everything so my content and my creations were reflections of that you can hopefully feel the heart there you can feel the essence of what it is I love, I want to feel, maybe I'm sad like let's express why I'm sad or I'm excited let's express why I'm excited but now that I'm more in tune with why I'm feeling certain emotions or what my story is I'm able to shape stories better so I'm able to I can tell a story in seven shots I can tell a story in one shot with the right music and you know working now everything I do is I work with amazing composer lives in Australia custom music we created together for each piece that we make because we want to really align ourselves with the story and we're working in unison to be able to tell a story and have an amazing visual effects artist his name's Igor, lives in Brazil and we work together in order to sit there and be like oh man wouldn't it be amazing if we're laying on the bed and we look up at the ceiling of sense of stars and then it tilts down from the stars and I go to take a step but obviously the floor is not water and just allowing our imagination just to be like this is what I feel this is what I'm seeing this is what I'm channeling and then working with like-minded people because no one person can do it themselves so aligning yourself with the right people and just not being afraid just tell the story and also once you're not afraid of your own emotions you're not afraid to do anything anymore I don't know what fear is I don't know what death is death is life I don't know what any of these notions are so all I know is love so I just continue to channel love and then I get to work with other people that feel the same way and then my craft grows from that because I'm growing so it's just everything's a progression so allowing yourself to realize the longer fully serves you and your higher consciousness and then you can then move away from that and then move into something that's bigger and better so you've built a team now when you were first starting out was it pretty solo? Was this kind of like- Very solo I mean even when I was with Usher I had never taken a photography course I didn't know what photography I mean obviously any of what photography was but I bought the Canon 70 and I was like I used to love the videos that I saw that were being made with that camera and then so I got it for video and then I remember day one working with him he was like oh we it'd be awesome to have some photos as well from this performance can we get some photos and I nodded and I was just like yeah of course and then I was like I'll figure it out and then I just like figured out that the shutter speed needed to be this in order for it to not be blurry and then I didn't like when the F stop was too high because I really liked the shallow depth of field and then I didn't like when the white balance was too cool and then I figured out how to color it to really convey the mess and then you just figure out how to channel a bit and that's another reason why I feel like I've a mast level of success and some fashion is because I'm always been a student I love learning so I wanted to learn how to shoot everything myself and then how to edit everything myself and then how to write everything myself and then how to edit the music all myself and how to add the sound effects all my so I did everything myself and then at a certain point you're like this can only take me so far because how can one person do all of this and why would I want to do it all by myself? So then being able to be like you're amazing at making music would you want to make some music for this? Absolutely I love what you're doing awesome let's do it together you're amazing at doing visual effects would you like to do this together? Absolutely Dude I love your eye behind the camera I think I'd be really good acting in the scene because I understand what the story is for this yeah let's do it at the office and you're just working with amazing people and then you all get to learn from each other you get to be like oh I like the way that you saw that shot that's awesome what if we did it and then it's all like and that's what life is isn't it hopefully you're just spending your time with people that are on the same wavelength as you and you get to just experience all that together and then when you get to do it creatively it's even bigger of a blessing I think because then you get to really be into and in channel something higher together so that's why when jazz bands are performing together you see like an orchestra which is another art that isn't flourishing anymore in terms of like commercial aspect which is a shame like being able to when these orchestras go in performing together a lot of the times they haven't met each other so first of them ever seeing the music all of a sudden a composer goes up there and then in perfect unison on the first they're able to just they're just channeling all it's an art it's amazing it's connection so being able to just really do that and then in every aspect of your life every conversation you have every person you spend time with and it opens you up you said when you're in high school that's when you realize that you you loved film and you really wanted to get into it and pursue it but when did you actually realize that this is something that was possible to do full time that you could actually make money doing it and school yeah that's one is that when you got paid for the first time to make videos I made I'd shot my history teacher's wedding and got paid $600 and I was like whoa and for me that was so strange too because it's your teacher so like you're as a kid you already have this like preconceived like concepts and like social construct of what it means for like a student teacher and like watching them like have fun and dance and all this and that broke down so many barriers to it was like whoa they're just they're us this is this is me just maybe older and then I got to do that and then I made all the highlight tapes for our school sports teams and then for other sports teams around the area and I got paid to do that and then I was making highlight reals for different athletes that we're applying for colleges because I liked watching Friday night lights the movie and obviously I just like took these things that I liked and I was able to resonate with and be like oh I can do that for you but with like my own kind of spin on it you know I can do this highlight real but like what if we show like what you want what you're like as a person and like add music to it and then so I was yeah you literally since I walked into high school freshman year took a video production class and they taught me Adobe Premiere Pro and I was like whoa I have the tools to do this myself I'd never the same sense and that's all I've really focused on ever I'd of course like studied other things in school you take Gen Eds and you take courses that give you a more versatile outlook on life like economics and science and but like all of these things just apply to each other anyway like I'm talking about physics and like I read Neil DeGrasse Tyson's Azure physics for people in a hurry because that gets to that tells you who we are in context to everything else like continue to learn about everything you know I I I love to know about how the molecular structure of our body makes up and how we have equal amount of water and how we are water as well and how what's happening at a some atomic level and then what happens with the plan it's start to align and in December what's happening with mercury and just being a master of our environment you know I'm only Jordan and this body right now so I want to know as much as I can about everything and then take the tools that feel really good to me and being able to apply that and then it comes into my videos as well I'll incorporate I love incorporating space into every video that I do there's going to be stars there's going to be planets there's going to be everything because we live on earth which is in the Milky Way galaxy which is part of a larger galaxy which is part of a bigger universe which is like we humans think that we are the the greatest thing that's ever happened but do you think an ant has an idea of a a construct of what humans are why do we think that we are it there's something bigger than us obviously that we're a part of so allow ourselves to humble ourselves because once you humble yourself and you remove your ego you can then really start to sok and enjoy all of the beauty that there is to offer that's happening so I think you're given an amazing gift in high school to stumble into that video class because it I manifested it sure there's a right time for for that to happen I mean you think about like classrooms and video production classes to that degree where you could have your own editing system I remember when I started editing my editing teacher in high school showed us the way they used to cut and like with the actual it was like the linear editing software so you had to just literally cut and splice in the moment and it was like one project I think was on VHS tape that we had to actually try that out and it's very limiting very difficult to create content obviously people have done that for decades but still very challenging and then this opens up and we can start to learn how to create content and then you know maybe five years prior that video class didn't exist yeah keep changing so even like James Cameron takes ten years to make a film why because he wants to the technology doesn't exist yet when he made avatar that technology didn't exist he worked with a team that figured out the best way to do motion capture in order for that exact image to come out the way he wants it to do so it's it's you we actively manifest and create our universe simultaneously in the now so yeah it was amazing that I got that tool but whether I got it in high school or now I think I'd still be doing the same thing you know it's just about allowing your your notion of time not to be a barrier or to limit you what you're doing you can be 45 years old and be like I want to be a singer why have I never sung my entire and then you can be a singer why not you know I think I think yeah I completely agree like don't get caught up on the tools I think more so what I was trying to get to was the fact that you started you got to start early I mean you don't like you said you started 45 if you want but to be able to put in the time into a craft and really be able to develop your your your style and the way that you work and also your ideas and the craft itself so you've been doing this for a very long time now and it obviously shows from first first video to what is the year I mean I agree with you're saying but what is the notion of time like a long time so like I've been doing it for 15 years or something like that what is that me and the grand scheme of life do you know what I mean like 15 years what is that even what is that equate to so yeah that's a long time maybe compared to someone else who's been doing it for six years but that's a very little time compared to someone who's been doing it for six years but that's a very little time compared to someone who's not for four so like stop the notion of always is never judged and what judging is not labeling not comparing so don't compare because there's no point of comparing because we are all operating on a different frequency doing different things so just allow yourself to only be focused on you and your love and your betterment because if I were to sit here and be like well I've been doing it for 15 years that's a long time then obviously and I may feel like that's too long of a time like you know I've been 15 it hasn't been it's not enough time that obviously I started trying to do even more and it's like relax your your your pace is your pace as long as you are operating from a feeling of love that you want to operate from and then everything else within that universe doesn't really matter time doesn't matter there's no such thing as time what is time when the sun goes up on earth when the when the when the planet rotates around the sun one one time on its on its access what is it humans created the notion of time in order to fit to to have understanding of our place in the universe there is none our our souls don't know the notion of time light doesn't know the notion of time time is is different yeah on different gravitational fields if you go towards a black hole you age differently then you do on this planet near the sun so you can move anything that tries to label or limit or compare anything in your life because there are there's literally no such things as that yeah i think i think there is i mean i don't live in that world i live in a world where i label things and i don't think that it affects me negatively i think that i do have to be mindful and aware of when i'm being overly critical of myself but i do think that i can look at a video that i've made and say that is a good video and look at a video i made 10 years ago and be like that one is not so good or i like this one better you know i mean and i agree comparisons can be harmful especially when we're comparing ourselves to other people but when you're comparing other people to other people like comparing if you're watching Netflix you know this stuff you like so you're not just going to turn on the TV and watch anything and be like while it's all relevant to leave it at that then be like i like this yeah okay that could be then of it you know absolutely yeah then i think it does become harmful and that's something i've struggled with too because i'm like i want to talk about this film and what i liked about it and what i didn't like about it maybe what i would do differently but a lot of times when we get into that mindset where we like have this language of being completely definitive like this is the way it is as opposed to no a thousand people could watch that and have completely different outlets or just any time you put an energy into anything other than positivity why you know you can maybe like i like this you didn't like something else but then why dive into why you didn't like it for too long because then all of a sudden you're putting your energy into something that's negative for what reason what about if it's positive what if it's talking about the joy and the love that's amazing but then take it and apply it to yourself like i like this i'm going to do something like this then that's just such a quicker more natural transition into something that's bettering you so then just be like i like this i like this i know this feels good but too much consumption of anything isn't good you know if i was sitting on the couch watching every movie i've ever loved always where am i where where am i taking the energy to channel something for for me or to you know or to apply it to myself so that's why it's like i'm i'm aware of the time that i'm applying myself and then i'm aware of the the time that i'm i'm allowing myself to consume things but for what purpose and for what reason but yeah i guess just knowing what you like is the strongest tool you could possibly have and allowing yourself never to focus on anything negative because you have the choice you have the choice to where you put your energy so only on positive things and if you find yourself thinking about something that isn't positive stop yourself and be like why am i thinking about something not positive how do i remove myself about thinking about something that's only positive and then continue to operate from there and then obviously time will completely change to you you know the stuff that you can get done in a day a day is going to be much more vast than you ever thought you may meet some you might meet some of you end up spending the rest of your life whatever that means the rest of your life with or you may end up having a conversation with some of that leads you down a completely different path or you may end up working or something upon something that can is you never would have expected but you just have to allow yourself to be like i'm only going to take my energy onto something positive today because you already know what you like if you're putting it towards something you don't like or trying to figure out why you don't like it then all of a sudden you're just you're going down the you're going the wrong way then all of a sudden the universe will trust me will be like focus on the stuff that you like where because it's yeah it's serving you better in a lot of ways isn't like that the post-modern notion of dropping labels and dropping definitions this isn't a bigger a little bit more challenging and difficult to over communicate all these things and say you know like well what does that actually mean but like we know what it means we do know what it means it's 24 hours and like obviously we can over like you know try to drop the notion to play a bit but I don't have to think about or talk about it like the time we're spending talking on it about it right now what how is it serving us well but in our everyday life we use these definitions and I use these words yeah okay you don't but then I think 90% 99% of the population may not be enlightened and they but that's why we have conversations like this so that way we can enlighten them so that way they are aware of the fact that you don't have to have a preconceived notion of what it is if you feel like staying up all night working on a video you can stay up all night working on a video but I don't think you could lose you can't not know what it is like now that you know what it is I'm aware of what it is yeah am I choosing to focus my attention on thinking about what it is no no but if I say what did you do today you would know what I'm talking about I know what you're asking but then would you was that upset like the fact that I'm using definitions and no but I feel like you're trying to get a specific answer out of me right now but I don't need to talk about what that is because if you can ask me what is how was your day I know you're basically saying how are you feeling and I can answer you appropriately but I'm not going to spend my time then thinking about what a day is because why would I do that why don't think we do well you're that's what you're trying to do well now we are now we're getting like over analytical about the the definitions but yeah I think it's just that's I think the the difficult thing to navigate is you're aware of the fact that it's difficult for you that's why you keep bringing it up so just start practicing it well I don't think that it's difficult for me to like use the word day and my concept of time I think what's difficult for people is practically bringing spirituality and mindfulness into their life without it another thing that helps you start talking about don't be like what's difficult for other people like we can't control other people so let's start talking about ourselves being like what's difficult for me is and then you can start applying it to only yourself because all you could ever do is affect yourself and then when you affect yourself you allow yourself to then project that onto other people and you allow yourself to then be a mirror for that for other people I don't can try to control anybody I'm fully aware of my surroundings but I am also very in tune with who I am and what I hold dear and what is my essential core and nature who I am so that way every interaction that I have I'm literally just a mirror so I can nothing affects me so if you're going to have a conversation about something that you want to have a conversation about that's absolutely fine I know that that no longer is has to do with me I can just be the best mirror of me possible and hopefully hopefully projected onto somebody else and they can be like oh I felt something from that but trying to like change someone or being like everybody perceives time in the wrong way how do I make them perceive time differently now you're taking all of your energy and focusing and not on yourself and you can't change anybody else and now you always send your battery that was once at a hundred percent and now you're drained to 40 putting it towards something that has nothing to do with you so put all of the energy into yourself allow yourself to be at a hundred percent so that way you can then be the best beacon of light that we could possibly be for other people to see and if they are ready to see it and they're ready to absorb it blessings if they aren't able to maybe then it can then evoke something within them to try to go and understand something differently but all we could ever change is ourselves yeah that's that's one thing I can definitely agree with you on is is the focus and how limited our focus is and how much how important it is to focus on really what you want to accomplish in life because we're filled in the world of distractions right now right there's so many different things that are pulling at our attention people that want this email respond people that want you to reply to their tweet how do you navigate the world and say online distractions and have a clear head and also be able to create at a high level I know what I like and I consume what I like it's all I can say when I'm on the internet I know what I like to consume and if it's something I don't like to consume I don't consume it there are no distractions you don't have any rules any rules where you're like all right I'm not going to check email before 10 a.m. do you have bad habits where you're like you wake up and you're check your phone first thing or do you know what's a bad habit why are you naming something a bad habit I would name that a bad habit because then the phone and the applications and the notifications start to control you but there's good things about all of those things as well stop thinking and if there's a if you're labeling something bad you're automatically creating something negative in your life stop thinking there's bad I don't think there's bad ever what about I mean maybe I'm going to the extreme here but I think it's helpful sometimes illustrate it there are bad like being a drug addict like I why is that bad because a kill you could ruin your family could destroy your life okay but why are they a drug habit why are they a drug addict why why are they well but why are they turning to there's big I understand what you're trying to ask but there are having a drug addiction means you're masking something figuring out why you're masking something can be the biggest blessing there is so why do you drink coffee is that an addiction yeah okay so I love it I love it but is it bad is it bad that you're addicted to it but I mean if this was meth in front of us then I would say that's probably not appropriate you're also comparing just you don't have to compare it like some people like their coffee some people like their alcohol some people like their shopping some people like their sex some people like their marijuana but why would you even focus on any of that has nothing to do with you all I know is if I get into an interaction with someone who has an addiction I have many friends and family members that we everyone has an addiction all you can possibly do again is just be the best version of yourself so that we when they are drinking alcohol or they are doing heroin or whatever is happening you can be like do see how in tune I am can I be a beacon of light for you what are you masking and maybe that can then give them the revelation that they need in order to fix themselves because all that could ever happen is they want to fix step one with an addiction is what acknowledge you have an addiction you have to acknowledge you have an addiction and then from there you are able to then proceed accordingly and be like okay have an addiction why do I have an addiction how do I fix this addiction addictions aren't bad we everyone has a form of an addiction so allowing yourself to say what am I truly masking being on the phone is an addiction checking your email is an addiction not being in your current thought process or being fully in tune with yourself is a form of addiction we have distractions now distractions or control mechanisms that's fine but all we could ever do is just be fully aware of ourselves if you know that you don't like waking up first thing in the morning and checking your email don't wake up first thing in the minute that if it helps you by setting rules then do that but then know that your rule is an addiction so just keep leaning yourself off of these things and know that you can then eventually reach the point where you are just the self observer of everything and you're operating from a place of love and you are no longer making decisions out of intentions you don't know why I know when I turn on my phone I know why I'm looking at my phone and I enjoy while I'm on it if I'm doing anything that I don't enjoy I take a step back and go why am I doing something I don't enjoy right now is it a stress am I am I feeling forced from am I from an outside force I'm being do I feel like I have an outside force pressing in on me making me feel like I need to answer this email right now because I have a deadline I'm going to take a step back I'm going to go in the sun I'm going to sit down I'm going to clear my thoughts but allow give your time to digest because we're talking about a lot of stuff here too that I know that you are like actively in the process of trying to like implicate into yourself right now so taking the time to be like I don't need to fully digest it right the second because that's a lot so to be like I am just going to allow it to simmer and then you know maybe see how it makes me feel and then I think it's a continuous process it adds in ways and something specifically like the social media stuff it's helpful for me like I think we just define it in different ways like you notice when something doesn't feel right and then you can take a step back and observe what's happening and why you're making the decisions that you're making for me I personally see that I do the same thing and maybe I call it a negative thing I say oh like I have this addiction to this phone or to these notifications and I want to be more mindful and I want to actually practice some mind like being very aware of when I'm on my phone so me personally I take a little bit of I'll set some rules like no phones in the bed at night or you know lately it's been no checking emails in the morning and we're maybe batching emails because I mean whatever it feels right to right there's practical things where if you're checking email 100 times a day you are going to be distracting yourself from the work that you're meant to be creating most people don't actually aren't creating their work within their inbox so if I could figure out a way to be more mindful and say all right I'm only going to check email once a day or twice a day I think it's going to make my life a little bit more productive and I'm going to go to create the art I want to create when I want to create you know that works for you so that's all it matters yeah if it works for you it works for you that's all we could ever yeah I mean I envy you and why but that's a that's a negative word within itself I don't think so I envy somebody who doesn't have to not like I'm not saying in this term that I want to be you but I know I envy the position but rather than envy someone being like those are qualities that I like how do I implement it into my life that best serves me yeah but I think it's also I like it I like it I envy it for you but I think it's cool for you but I also like I respect that it works for you but I also know that it's not going to work for me and I want to bring into my life that's the definition of envy isn't it? yeah right I think like I was just using a loose definition of envy sure yeah man so I'm curious about like the art now because you were saying that you were pushing yourself more and more into the the art space like what does that mean for you are you looking to make future documentaries or you trying to everything yeah I don't label I'm I'm gonna keep making my story until it until I buy human body can't make stories anymore so yeah that's it just writing every day creating every day and continuing to operate from that space until I physically can't do it in this this realm anymore so yeah and I'm excited for people to see it so don't don't know when it's out it'll be on my social media and I'll make announcements about it and all that funds is this something in the works now that you're that's special to you making a movie right now oh yeah that's amazing man yeah I'm excited when do you start it it's been started yeah yeah and something that you're you're keeping on the low for now and it's out it's out yeah yeah I don't I don't live too future for it so I'm just actively working on it and then as soon as it's in the place that it's done and ready then oh people will see it yeah yeah what was the spark that got you wanting to pursue your own art like when was there a switch when you were like because you do the commercial stuff you still continue to do it was there a spark that pushed you into it no just continuing to move from what feels good yeah I just I make decisions off of what feels good so I just know what feels the best for me right now is working on myself and working on things that I can truly put my heart in soul into so that's doing cool yeah all right then you want to get to quick questions sure there's quick questions quick questions that necessarily quick answers so feel free to elaborate but as you know the podcast is it's really trying to help people who are just getting started out get their footing and figure out the right direction to head okay so some of these are designed in that way sure so what book has had the biggest impact on your life oh that's a difficult question how to sit there's a book by Zenmaster called How to Sit and it explains what sitting is and how you could actually enjoy sitting there's essentially the art of meditation but being able to be still with your own thoughts and not be scared of them it's a great book it's an easy read do you meditate every day I live in a state of meditation yeah I practice I used to practice meditation every day I also meditate if I feel as if I am not clear with what's the current moment but yeah I live in the state of meditation when are you happiest always good answer so I know yeah what skill skill have you leveraged in a way that you think others haven't the art of meditation the art of being yeah what's the simplest advice that's the most important to follow no what you love no what love feels like and operate from that space two more questions one thing people should read watch or listen to before they go to bed tonight not immediately before bed but before the day ends in my definition of the day I I recently watched on Netflix since eight is a really good TV show that I enjoyed watching and then oh yeah and Netflix is really good too but then I before go to bed I meditate so I guess getting in tune with what you're feeling I don't I don't think it's good for anybody to be consumed with a lot of distractions before they go to sleep because then you're not you're defeating the purpose of sleep and then you're good because what sleep sleep is no different to meditating if you want it to you could be aware of your dreams so allow yourself to be really in tune with how you're feeling before you go to sleep because if someone has a nightmare it's your subconscious trying to work out something that you didn't get to process that day so allow allow yourself to really be in tune with how you're feeling that day what your thoughts are because it's important and if people want to see your work online or connect with you what's the best
