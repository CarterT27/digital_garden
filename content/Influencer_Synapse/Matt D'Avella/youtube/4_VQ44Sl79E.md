I went on my first flight when I was 20 years old. I was a little late to the game. Since then I've traveled all over the world and it's taught me a lot about myself. Especially when dealing with travel delays and cancelled flights.

 Good morning. We are here at Whale Beach, just north about an hour north Sydney and it's very early in the morning. It's like 5.36 a.m. at this point. What I want to talk about today is the zen of travel. I haven't been traveling for very long. First time I ever went on a plane. I was 20 years old and I was hooked. Travel has taught me a little bit about patients. On this trip in particular we had a walk time. First flight canceled. My second flight was delayed 18 hours. Finally got to LA. I got to connect flight within two hours. LA to Brisbane. Problem is we're going to sit me. The great thing about my experience on this trip in particular was that everybody that I met took it lightly. Everybody was laughing and joking about the situation. How you react to the situation is all on you. There's a lot of opportunity to complain. When I think that a lot of companies today, they incentivize us to complain because if we complain, we get what we want. We get an upgrade. We get our money back. But I don't think that really trains us to be good people. So you can choose in the moment to say, hey, you know what? I'm going to get there eventually. It's not a waste of time. If you figure out something to do, that's more productive. Whether it's doing a little bit of work or enjoying a nice conversation. So I think that's one thing that I've learned about travel in general and remind of on this trip here to Sydney. Subscribe to this channel for more videos. I upload new content every week.
