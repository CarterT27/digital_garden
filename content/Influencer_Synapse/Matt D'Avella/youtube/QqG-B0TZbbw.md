# The Best Damn Steak in America

My dad doesn't make it up to Brooklyn very often. The city scares him. So to celebrate his courage I decided to treat him to the Michelin rated Peter Luger's Steak House. It's not cheap but holy crap is it good.

They fire up these steaks at 800 degrees for four minutes and bring it out on a plate that's still sizzling. And not the kind of sizzling you get at Applebee's. There's something different about this sizzle.
