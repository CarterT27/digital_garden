## Transcript
 Hey, what's up guys? My name is Thomas Frank and as you might know if you've been watching my channel for any length of time I make a lot of videos on productivity and on how to work better and in this video I want to share the best book that I read this year for my own productivity and the one that taught me the most Important lessons that I applied to my work now. Given the nature of my work is that book principles by Raidolio No, is it's ultralarning? No again. Is it some big long book by Robert Green with tons of annoying red text and the margins? No, it's actually a book by somebody who doesn't really work in the productivity or self-help or career success industry is whatsoever the book is how music works by David Bern Who is the founder or at least one of the founding members of the band talking heads now like I said the author of this book is not a Productivity consultant. He's not some self-help guru in this book isn't a productivity book at all It's a book about how music works a lot of it is about his own life in performance It's about recording technology and how it's changed. It's how the production of music has changed Nonetheless the lessons that I took from this book have impacted my work and improved the way that I do it More than the lessons I took from any other book that I read this year and in this video I want to share three of them that I think are going to help you as well So the first big lesson that I took from this book is that creative works often come out of a specific context Like a specific audience that an artist is trying to reach or a specific venue in which they have to play In other words creativity is improved by having limitations placed upon us This is actually kind of the opposite view that most people have when they think of great artists We often think that artists just have this amazing idea come to them in the middle of the night That it just have some sort of genius the rest of us don't have the book puts it this way the accepted narrative Suggests that a classical composer gets a strange look in his or her eye and begins Furiously scribbling a fully realized composition that couldn't exist in any other form or that the rock and roll singer is driven by Desire and demons and outbursts this amazing perfectly shaped song that had to be three minutes and 12 seconds Nothing more nothing less and this view is actually the complete opposite from the truth that we either Unconsciously or consciously make things that fit into pre-determined contexts or formats Some examples could include the audience their current tastes their demographics the venue could be Outside to be a cathedral a sports arena headphones in your ears or it could be the medium Say a vinyl disc that only holds so much information to hone in on one specific example Cathedral music often stays within the same key throughout the entire duration of a piece Needless as long haunting notes and the reason for this as Robert Jordan points out in this book music the brain And next to see is that some cathedrals have reverberation times of up to seven seconds Which is incredibly long and within an environment like this music it uses lots of complex Percussive sounds or that modulates between different keys becomes a chaotic mess really really quickly So less than that I took from this part of the book is that a lack of limitations or a lack of context is actually a bad thing for being creative Or forgetting things done because when you have limitless options You often just choose none of the above you've probably seen the power of limitations at work in your own life as well I mean how many times have you found yourself under a tight deadline and actually been more focused as a result So one thing that I've been trying to do recently is to give myself some sometimes arbitrary limitations when I take on a project For example, my one hour morning routine video that I published about a month ago and which was one of the more successful videos on my channel recently Had some rules in place before I ever touched a camera number one the video could be no more than seven minutes long And number two during the part where I explained the routine I had to do it off camera as a voiceover narration which is something that I had never done before So these limitations actually helped me to generate better ideas than I would have without them because once I had boundaries They gave me a small area of focus in which I could be creative Lesson number two had to do with the value of building up anticipation before doing something big or Surprising and this lesson comes from the part of the book where he was talking about his life as a performer Specifically when he was putting together the stage production for the album stop making sense Which was actually very well received and the concerts they were putting together for this album weren't Your normal average pop concerts There were all kinds of additional elements. He tried to take inspiration from different types of Broadway theater and Asian theater So there was a lot going on in these productions and during the filming the first few shows in Los Angeles He was able to meet and get some critiques from a Beijing opera performer who was pretty blunt with what he had to say And one of those things was about the value of building up anticipation for the audience before doing something surprising Here's how he puts it in the book. One added was long lines of needing to let the audience know you're going to do something special Before you do it you tip them off and draw their attention to you and you have to know how to do it in a way that isn't obvious Or toward whoever is going to do the special thing now You notice that this is kind of counter-intuitive and you think so as well because if you tell the audience what you're going to do before you do it You spoil the surprise, right? Well, no if you do it correctly You actually draw their attention to the surprise because if you don't do it then half your audience is just not paying attention And they're going to miss it and in the book burn notes that this is a rule that doesn't just apply to stage Performances or to musical performances You notice that stand-up comedians probably have very similar rules for getting the audience ready for punch line And you can probably think of several other applications This is why drum rolls happen in circuses why movie trailers now have teaser trailers like trailers for trailers And why pop songs have pre-courses that build things up for the main chorus now. This is less than that I haven't seen in any other productivity book that I've read in the past yet I could immediately see how it would help me do my work better. Yes, I don't get up on stages I don't do musical performances But as a youtuber as a writer has somebody who creates media and shares things with the world I can see the value of Using hype using anticipation to get my audience ready for what I'm going to do if I don't do that Like he says, I'm probably going to surprise people to the point where they're just going to miss it or not care And that brings us to the third lesson, which actually isn't contained within the pages of this book at all But as more a meta lesson that kind of dawned on me as I was reading this don't just learn from Productivity people don't just learn from self-help gurus and people who write about career success Instead try to branch out a bit. I know that when I was younger I was pretty single-minded about trying to become more productive Trying to get ahead in my career and as a result I had tunnel vision whenever I'd go to a bookstore I would immediately make a B-line for the business section or the self-help section I would kind of exclude all other sections and I know a lot of other people who do the exact same thing People are always asking me what's the best productivity book that you read this year? But the thing about people who write about productivity the thing about people who are in the self-help industry is that They tend to have a pretty narrow band of work experience especially when we're talking about careers that span many many decades People in these industries tend to make their living in just a few ways either in mass media Production you know recording audio recording videos like this one because I am including myself in this group of people or Writing books or other people who run businesses or who speak on stages and I'm not saying this to belittle any of those things or to belittle these people Because those are important things and there's a lot you can learn from them But again, it's a very narrow band of experience compared to all the different professions and pursuits that are out there So don't just focus your attention on the business and the self-help guru is at the exclusion of all other voices At the very least read accounts for people who have done what you want to do or work in the industry that you want to break into Personally, I want to play more music in the future, which is why I write a book by a musician But I think you should go even further than that. I mean, I don't particularly want to go get into the opera But the lessons I took from that opera performer who was talked about in this book are definitely applicable to my work as a YouTube producer People who work in specific industries often learn lessons that really can't be learned in other places But that are applicable to those other places none the less and this is also an argument for digging into new fields and exploring new areas on your own When you do this you gain new insights that you can then creatively apply to anything else that you've already been doing For just one example Brian May the guitarist for Queen used his physics background figure out how to create that Stop clap effect and we will rock you and most people wouldn't think that you would use a physics background as a musician But well, there you go and if you want to learn about physics or math and science in general Then you should check out brilliant Brilliant is learning platform helps you quickly improve in these areas along with computer science They're an incredibly active hands-on learning experience that includes interactive challenges, storytelling, and even code writing They're library more than 60 courses includes a complete math suite that spans everything from the fundamentals of number theory to Calculus and differential equations and statistics There are science courses like classical mechanics and the science of waves and light and computer science courses that cover algorithms Data structures and even how search engines work and because all these courses are so interactive You'll find yourself really stretching your problem solving abilities as you work through them Which helps you become an overall better thinker now?
