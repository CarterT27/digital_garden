# Hiking the Flatirons - Bonus Vlog!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQUD8KhWunI
I HAVE NO IDEA HOW TO VLOG - but I hope you enjoy this video anyway. 

Anna and I road tripped out to Denver, Colorado this week to do some exploring, as we're planning on moving there next year.

Part of the trip was spent in Boulder, which meant I had to go hike the Flatirons. Unfortunately, the trail we picked didn't go up to the top - but it was still pretty awesome!

## Transcript
 Hello, we are in Boulder, Colorado this week. Now I will resume your regularly scheduled study tips and whatnot next week, but today I'm just going to show you the flat arms. Okay, here we go. This is what we want. The railroad second, third flat arms loop, two, first, second flat arms trail, that's what we want. So last year climbed my first mountain in San Diego, mountain was 1100 feet elevation gain. This will be 1400. My next goal is 5000 in one trip, so this doesn't make it. So if you have suggestions for me, where I 5000 elevation gain mountain, I should do next. Let me know. What do you do? There is no ball. What do you do with me? No ball. Yeah? I found Stonehenge. Are you mad with your snowball on you? Yes. Pretty sure that Stonehenge right there. We are going up there. Wow. The district 100 games announcer in the background over there. That one going on. Maybe the test. This is like the one thing about Colorado. Everything that way is amazing. Everything that way is more Iowa basically. It's all that will keep filming this way. Okay. Time to go up there. Nine nine nine eight eight one nine nine. And one one nine seven two five three slow mo music. Those are boulders here in boulders. Here we go. Pretty cool. Pretty cool. Uh-huh. This has been rolling. Oh my god. How are you going to get down? A little back lip. That's not going to work. Oh my god. You're making me so nervous. I don't know where you're going. There he is. Good job. See, tell me you don't want to go up that. There you go. Oh, this is awesome. This is on your house. You're going to live here. Oh, it's a big issue. Nice. This big issue is drawn by the people in 5,000 BC. Is it? All right. We're going to do it. Okay. Just a backpack off and be. You liked seeing me do that. Wouldn't you? Do things makes sense. Oh, god. I just looked directly into the sun. So I have a long day, 34. Oh, I got to eat his rocks. What the kind of art do we got here? We got sun. I can't tell what this is. We got a bear. Hi. Hello. That's a pretty freaking cool shot right there. So anything in my crib? It's got a skylight. Built in. Didn't even have to pay for it. Welcome, my new crib. My name is X to the Z exhibit. This car is going to hit my head on that. You good? I don't know if I want to go up there. Hey. Hey, you did it. You did it. I wanted your help. You lost short of me. And you didn't start the parkour club in high school. Do you have something like a flavor for that club or anything? No, it wasn't really like a real club. Like we didn't have any blessings. We made a website and we just like, hey kids. Want a new parkour? Okay. We'll teach you. We have like three golden rules. Three golden laws of robotics pretty much. It's like only do what you're comfortable with. Uh, ask for help if you need it. And never ever ever do it, Eric does. Because our front Eric was sort of vitally insane. I have no memory of this place. Oh wait, we found the drill. Okay. Hi. Oh. She's filming me. I want to climb it. She won't let me. She won't let me. Gotta climb it here. She cares about safety and stuff. Just kidding. Hashtag lawyers and hashtag liability and stuffbsafe.com. I'm your dad. Yeah. So I thought I'd seen the last of the cool stuff, but no. Pretty awesome. And it banged ya. I feel like every good movie or vlog should have a narrative beginning in the middle and an end where I stand on top of the mountain. But I don't know if I can get there. Apparently there's not a trail that goes to the top though. So I guess I can't do the closing act. Okay. Maybe end it right here.
