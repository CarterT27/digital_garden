 Hey, what's up guys? So last week we did a video about whether or not music is an effective study aid or if it's just a distraction And at the end of that video, I said I wanted to follow it up with a video on music that's intentionally designed to increase focus or concentration or some other cognitive function And well to be honest, that video's research isn't ready yet. I've been researching all week and I'm going to put a comment down below this video If you want some more explanation on it, but in short, I'm going to have that video coming out next week So I have a little bit more time to polish it and make it as good as you guys deserve But I didn't want to just not publish anything this week So I went looking in the college and book eat community, which has been up for a few weeks now and there was a really good question by a student who said Often I'm paired up with group members that refuse to do any work No matter how many times I attempt a conversation or email them or phone them or even just talk to them face-to-face I don't know if they lack motivation or if there's just something wrong with me that they're refused to work with me help So the question really here is How do I deal with group members that aren't contributing to the group project and I have had to deal with this before? I know like personally friends of mine who've been sitting up at almost like 11 59 p.m. Waiting for a group member to email the last part of group project so they can submit it when it's due at midnight Like this is a common problem So in this video, I've got five quick tips for you to deal with Unresponsive or quap un-cropative or lazy group members and the first tip is to Consider that maybe it's not a lazy-nish issue Maybe it isn't that they are simply not doing any work and rather it's actually a communication problem with your group There could be just inefficiencies in how you guys communicate or share files or get things done So when the group project is set up and you're able to Communicate for the first time in class after all the details were given I think you should really take stock of everything that needs to be done Divi up all the work and assign roles and assigned tasks and have everyone in the group verbally affirm what they're gonna do That way everyone else knows what they said they're gonna do They're a little bit more beholden to it and they are accountable to everyone else Also during that first meeting it is critical that you get as much communication information from each group member as they are comfortable Giving so email address or phone number or whatever it is just in case something comes up But tip number two, I think it's much better to use a tool that is specifically designed for group work Rather than trying to communicate through email or something in the past that used things like Google Docs or base camp or Trello But the one I'm using right now is called a sauna and I'm gonna recommend it because I am loving this tool And I'm using it for all the work that I do with both of the people who regularly help me with work on college in Bogeek It's totally free for groups of up to 10 people so you'll never have to pay for it And it's just really good for assigning tasks and keeping projects really well organized You can sync up dropbox, so it's really easy to attach files and overall I just absolutely love it So tip number three is to pay very close attention to deadlines and structure the projects with that there are many deadlines Along the way so so you have a group project and there's five of you and it's due in two weeks So instead of being like all right, this is your role. This is your role You guys go do it and get it all done by the due date You need to build basically check points along the way for each person to send work to an editor or a project manager And I'm gonna say like if you're worried about group members not Pulling their weight or the group project not getting done in general It's probably a good idea for you yourself to take on the project management role because if you're worried about this You're likely to be one of the more responsible members in the group but with these many deadlines You can make sure things are along schedule You can make sure people aren't procrastinating and I think it is absolutely essential for one deadline in particular to be created And that is a deadline for everyone to get everything they need to contribute to the editor of the project At least one day before the deadline preferably to that way the editor has time to get everything in order and actually submit it before the deadline So now we've moved on to tit number four, which is emailing the professor So maybe the communication is not an issue Maybe the tools are not an issue and you really just have somebody who is unresponsive or who's just not getting their work done And they're dragging the entire group down you feel you need to bring the issue to your professor Well, you can do that, but you need to think very carefully before you do and make sure you do it in the right way Because it's very possible that your professor is trying to structure this group project as a simulation for the real world Where there is a project manager who is responsible for the group and If you're that project manager or if somebody else if the project is the project manager It's their responsibility to do what they can to make sure the project is on track before you escalate it to a supervisor Which is in this case your professor? So if you haven't already emailed that member who's not doing what they're supposed to do If you haven't already escalated that to a face-to-face conversation in class Your professor might well ask you why you didn't do that before bugging them with the problem Also if you're going to go to the professor You want to do it early on in the project right when the problem readers had and you've already tried things out Rather than waiting because they're going to ask you why do you wait until now to bring this problem to me Rather than nipping it in the bud right when it was actually a problem and that brings us to the last and most Inconvenient tip which is that you might just need to suck it up Do the work for them and let them ride your coat tails. It sucks. It's awful totally unfair But it's great training for the real world It was actually somebody in the subreddit who expressed a lot of surprise when I said that they were like wait a minute People in the real world aren't more responsible than people in college and I would say on the whole people do mature They grow up they become more responsible than they were as teenagers or college students But there's always going to be people in almost any organization you work in in the future that aren't going to pull their weight Or they're going to be disorganized or they're just not going to communicate well and you're going to have to deal with that and Professors know that that's why they build group projects part of the intention here is to help you work in a group and deal with those kind of issues And they know that some people are not cut out for group work and they're just not responsible So hopefully this video has been helpful to you in some way I know dealing with unresponsive group members is absolutely awful And that's why in college when I had the option to I often elected to do group projects by myself instead of with a group But sometimes you have to deal with a unfortunate situation So if you have additional tips or you want to discuss this video There will be an official discussion thread in the college and food geek community linked down below in the description and as always Thank you so much for watching and I will see you next week Hey there guys thanks so much for watching this video if you want to get new videos every single week I'm being a more effective student you can click that big red subscribe button right there I also wrote a book on how to earn better grades which has an entire chapter on group projects So if you'd like to get a free copy of it you click the picture on the book and if you want to read the article for this video orange logo right there and last week's video we talked about the relationship between music and studying So if you missed that video and you want to dig into it Click the thumbnail and if you want to connect with me I'm on Instagram and Twitter at Tom Franklin or you can then comment down below or in the description
