 Hey, what's going on guys? So today we are hitting new technology versus old technology because a lot of you guys have been asking me to compare the iPad Pro to a regular old notebook when it comes to the task of not taking And since I have owned my iPad Pro for several months now, I feel qualified to answer this question So in this video, I'm going to break down the strengths and weaknesses of each one and give you a conclusion But I'm gonna shake things up a bit and give you my conclusion right up front because having tested both of these things at least for me The iPad Pro with all of its awesome features quality life improvements connections to the cloud Doesn't beat the writing experience of good old fashioned paper now. I will say that writing on the iPad Pro with an apple pencil is hands down No question the best digital writing experience. I have ever had though. I do have to admit that I have not yet written on a surface from Microsoft So if you have written on both, I would love to hear from you down in the comments But the iPad Pro versus palm pilots versus laptops that are two in ones with styluses versus the old iPad with one of those styluses you bought from the store with a little squishy nub on the end It's better than all of them by a mile. However, it still doesn't beat the experience of writing on actual paper Though I do want to mention that I've kind of ditched normal dead tree type paper for something called the rocket book Which is actually an erasable notebook. You can take a wet ragging and erase everything that you've written on the pages And then the cool thing about the rocket book is that every single page has this little QR code on it along with a row of icons So you can actually set up their app to scan pages and send them the different digital destinations based on which icon you marked So if you had maybe six different ever note notebooks for your classes You could actually set each of those icons to be for one of your classes and make it really easy to digitize your notes And still write them down on paper But I digress this is not a video about the rocket book. This is a video about the iPad Pro versus paper And I've already talked about the writing experience So the rest of this video is going to be about some of the features you can get by taking notes on the iPad Pro So if you are the kind of person who can get used to the writing experience with the Apple pencil If you're not like me and you think they're basically equivalent Then let's talk about some of the things that you do get with the iPad Pro as well as one particular use case with the iPad Pro Absolutely outshines the competition and where I personally use it and to start we have to talk about apps Because if you get a brand new iPad Pro out of the box I don't think there's a default app on the system that lets you write and take notes really nicely with the pencil Correct me if I'm wrong down in the comments, but I don't think there is one so you have to go find a third party app And the app that I have found to be the absolute best combination of features and usability Personally, this is my opinion is called note shelf two now with note shelf two you get a note shelf of note books And when you open up a notebook you get a pretty convincing piece of notebook paper to write on and Immediately as I was writing on my piece of notebook paper here with my Apple pencil I started to notice one really cool feature that you get with the iPad Pro and that has to do with the iPad's ability to split screen different apps you can actually devote one half of the screen to your note shelf two app And the other half of the screen to maybe a textbook that's been digitized or the slides of your lecture If they're available to you or maybe just some research online that you're using for a paper you have to write Having your notes on one side of the screen and your research on the other side of the screen and being able to actually write on that screen is Pretty darn cool and what's even cooler with note shelf two you can actually copy any piece of text in another app Hold down the pencil and then drag that text into your notes automatically and this is a really cool feature You can resize the text box you can mark it up annotate it draw over it do whatever you want This is a really cool feature for taking pieces of research and creating a nice little collection of them in your notes Additionally note shelf two has lots of different pen options You can change the pen thickness you can change it to a mechanical pencil style You can change the color you can save favorites. There is a lot you can do with the pen tool here and if you don't feel like writing You can actually open up a text tool pair of Bluetooth keyboard to your iPad and mix types notes with written notes with the pencil And something else that actually just happened My app just updated and told me about it You can also convert your handwriting to text So if you want the experience pan writing, but you want it to be nice legible text this apple now do that So that's an overview of note shelf's note taking features But that's not all it can do because you can actually import PDFs and other documents into note shelf And then mark them up and annotate them with the pencil and this is the use case with the iPad Pro Beats every single other tool out there for my purposes I've marked up bank statements with it to figure out spending patterns and as an even better example I've imported my entire book 10 steps running out some grades as a PDF into this app So I can mark up the typos I wrote this book three years ago and as many of you guys have pointed out to me There are still typos in the book because I foolishly tried to edit it myself So a couple of times in the recent past I've headed over to a coffee shop I've got myself a coffee and I've pulled out the iPad and the pencil and opened up my PDF and then setting the pencil to a red setting I've gone through every page of the book looking for typos and things that I want to change Now this is clearly better than printing out the entire book and trying to mark it up with a pen because I'm not killing a bunch of trees But I can also bookmark pages in this app So every single time I find an error I bookmark that page and then once I'm done marking up the entire book I'll be able to open up the absolute drawer of bookmarked pages and I'll be able to see every single page that has an error And I'll be able to omit any page that doesn't have an error and breaking away from note shelf two for a second This is a huge strength of the iPad Pro over all the pencil is an amazing highlighting tool And it highlights really well and basically any note taking and reading app including eye books and Kindle Additionally with both of those apps you get the ability to write notes on top of your highlights in those books So that can be a really nice way to add your thoughts to a space that you've highlighted going back to note shelf two You might be thinking that all of your note taking is going to be siloed into this app But that is not the case because note shelf two actually has lots of options for automatically exporting your notes to Basically wherever you want to send them you can export to google drive you can export to dropbox and you can export to evernote And the integration with evernote is particularly tight because you can select the individual note book that you want to be Exporting your notes to don't note that currently there doesn't seem to be way to export notes to an existing notebook with in Evernote that has other content in it rather than notebook within note shelf will create its own notebook in Evernote so you might want to start using the notebook that note shelf creates for your type to notes as well So overall if you decide to take your notes on an iPad Pro you do get a lot of extra features Whether using note shelf two or some other app There's a lot you can do that you can't do on a standard paper notebook like I mentioned earlier the writing experience on paper is still so good for me That I'm going to go ahead and just a met all those little quality of life improvements Except for the aforementioned PDF annotating But again if you're the kind of person that can get used to writing with that apple pencil and you like it just as much as a writing on a paper Notebook then the iPad Pro does offer a lot Though it does have to be said that an iPad Pro costs hundreds of dollars possibly even more than a thousand if you get the top model And the paper notebook is like what a dollar from Walmart the rocket book is about thirty four dollars Though since you can wipe it away should eventually pay for itself and in both cases They are far and away cheaper than the iPad Pro anyway I'm curious to hear your thoughts down in the comments about the iPad Pro if you have experience with it If you have experience with other apps that I
