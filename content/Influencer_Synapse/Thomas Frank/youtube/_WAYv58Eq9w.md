## Transcript
 Today, I'm going to share seven quick general workflow tips that I used to boost my productivity on a daily basis. And the commonality between all these workflow tips is that they are focused on shaving time off of repeated processes. These are things that I do every single day, often multiple times a day. Now, none of these tips are specific to any one job or profession. None of them are even specific to any one computer application. Though most of them do target things that happen within your computer. In the computer? So, if the work that you do happens on the computer, then this video is primarily for you. Though with one of these tips we are going to venture out into the world. Alright, let's get into it. Tip number one, use text expansion to bind long strings of texts that you have to type often to small keywords. For example, I'm using a program called AutoHotkey on my PC to bind my home address to the keyword H-A-D-R. Now, at least on Windows, AutoHotkey is probably the best way to do this. Number one, it is absolutely free and number two, it is incredibly powerful. It has a lot more can do besides just text expansion. On the Mac side, it is a program called ATX, which is about five bucks, it's not free, but it does have a lot of customization options, and it's really easy to use. And if you want to do this on Android or iOS, there are text expansion options for both of those platforms as well, and I'll have some links in the description below if you're interested in that. Tip number two, start using your computer's quick access areas more often. Whether you're on Mac or PC, the File Explorer program that comes stock with your computer has a little sidebar where you can put shortcuts to the folders that you use most often. For my workflow, I keep persistent links to Google Drive, to a lot of my business supporters, and the folder where screenshots are automatically saved on my computer. And in addition to all those folders, I also keep temporary shortcuts to all the videos that I'm working on until they're done. Tip number three, spend some time learning the keyboard shortcuts for the programs that you use most often. Back when I was in college, I spent a lot of time learning the keyboard shortcuts for ever note, which made me a much faster note taker, and in recent years, I spent a lot of time learning the ones for Photoshop, After Effects, and Premiere, all of which make my video editing process a lot more efficient. Now, in addition to the specific programs that you use for your work, be it logic pro or be it blender or whatever it is, I would also suggest going and learning the shortcuts for your email program, because simply learning that in Gmail at least, hitting E can archive a message, hitting pound can delete a message, these can make your email processing time a lot shorter. And one good thing to note is that for most popular programs, there are cheat sheets out there that you can find for the most important keyboard shortcuts. Though if you do use a really complex program like logic or like After Effects, I would also recommend having a personal reference to keyboard shortcuts that you use most often. And on the off-chance that keyboard shortcuts are actually interesting to you, that you can go even further down the rabbit hole and start learning about the wide world of macros. These are buttons on your keyboard, or sometimes on external devices that you can program to do basically whatever you want. And if you want your head to spin in a good way, then a good place to start will be any of Terran Van Heamer's videos on keyboard macros over Atlantis Tech Tips channel. All right, we are now on to tip number four. And for this tip, we are going to briefly venture out of the computer and into the real world, because I'm going to suggest that you put any of your commonly used physical tools within arm's reach of your workspace. Now to do this for myself, I'm using a swivel drawer that screws into the bottom of my desk, and I did just discover that there is now a clamp on version, so that's even more accessible. But within mine, I've got scissors, I've got SD cards, in case I need more camera memory space, I've got a little pin for resetting different devices, box cutter, pens, pencils, highlighters, sticky notes, all kinds of stuff that I find myself frequently reaching for. Tip number five, use a launcher tool. A launcher tool is a little utility in your computer that essentially lets you hit a very quick key combination that brings up a little window where you can type, and then lets you easily launch websites, programs, files, all kinds of other stuff. Now the best launcher tool that exists in the entire world is called Alfred, and it is unfortunately Mac only. But by hitting command and space on my Mac, I can make it this nice little typing window that lets me launch any website, any folder I want, and do lots of other things, ranging from really simple stuff like doing calculations, to lots of complex and really deep user-generated workflows. Like this one, which deeply links into my password manager dash lane, and lets me find a password or username without having to actually go over to the application and search using its window. Now unfortunately, nothing quite as good as Alfred exists on windows, but there is an open source program called Walks, which is free and does a lot of what Alfred does except for some of that really complex word flow stuff. Tip number six, I guess I need to second hand this time, use a clipboard manager. Now whether you're using a Mac or a PC, your computer has a clipboard where you can copy text or copy images, and then paste them elsewhere. The problem is that computers buy default only remember the very last thing that you copied. So if you copied something a while ago, and then you copied something later on, that thing you copied first, it's just gone. And I don't know about you, but I want my clipboard to remember more than just one thing, and it can with the clipboard manager. Now on windows, the absolute best one that I found is called clipboard health plus spell, and you can do a lot more than just saving your clipboard history, you can have favorites, you can do all kinds of different stuff. And on the Mac side, there are tons of dedicated clipboard managers as well, but wouldn't you know, it's Alfred also has a built-in clipboard manager. I just love Alfred. So use that unless you really, really want something dedicated for some reason. That brings us to our final tip in the video, lucky number 7. Try using virtual dust tops. So here's the thing, I love using dual monitors, but not everyone can afford a second monitor, and not everyone has the space for a second monitor, even if they do have the money to buy one. But if you find yourself in either of those situations, you don't have to have tons of things crowding up your desktop all the time, because all major OS platforms, windows, Mac, and Linux have virtual dust tops, which basically means you can switch from one desktop to another really, really easily, and you can put different programs on different dust tops. So for me, when I'm working at a coffee shop from a Mac, I don't have a big monitor like this behind me, I like to put my email, my Spotify, my password manager, on my second desktop, that way my first desktop can be completely dedicated to my browser. Additionally, on the Mac, when you full screen an app, it gives it its own virtual dust top, and I often use that when I'm writing an Evernote or in-type forum. So to do a quick recap here, number one, use text expansion to bind long strings of text that you often have to type to very short to keywords. Two, start using your computer's quick access area to create shortcuts to common folders. Three, learn the keyboard shortcuts for the apps that you use most often. Four, find a way to put columnly use tools within arms reach of your workspace, maybe use a swivel drawer. Five, use a launcher tool like Alfred or walks. Six, start using a clipboard manager, and finally, number seven, clean up your desktop by using multiple virtual dust tops. Now, starting to use any one of these seven tips can definitely make a marginal improvement to your workflow on a day-to-day basis. But if you also want to make sure that the foundations of your productivity are solid ones, then you may also want to go and take my productivity systems course over on Skillshare.
