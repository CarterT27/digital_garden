 Hey, what's up guys? So I think it's high time for a bonus video. So let's step away from the study tips and tactics for a minute and talk about how I actually make these videos. Specifically, in this video, I want to show you my gear and also walk you through my actual filming process. So let's dive right in. So believe it or not, I'm actually rocking and relatively inexpensive setup to make these videos. For the camera, I'm using a Sony NEX 5N mirrorless camera which ran me about 750 bucks when I bought it and takes really high quality videos for the price. Now that's hooked up via HDMI to a small TV which I used to set my scene up and make sure I'm in focus and all that good stuff. Since my camera doesn't have a flip-out screen. For lighting, I've got a couple of DIY lights constructed from supplies I found at Lowe's and clamped on to cheap lights stands for Amazon. They cost me about 100 bucks to make for both of them and they're much easier to store and work with in the pre-made options I found. So I'm more than happy with them for now. I've also got some accent lighting on my backdrop to want to have the scene a bit and speaking in the backdrop, what do you guys think of the new one? I actually just moved in this time around I actually made measurements and used a level instead of just slapping things up over time. The other important part of the backdrop is my computer which is also what I use for recording the audio. And on a side note, this is actually a new build that I've been saving up for quite some time and let me know in the comments if you'd like to see a bonus video on it. Maybe I'll do it. Now I actually think audio quality is more important than video quality so I've recently invested in a Mackey ProFX 8 mixing board which feeds the audio via USB into my computer. They are a record using Adobe addition and then on the other end of that chain is a sure SM7B dynamic mic which I use for both recording the college and book eight podcasts and my videos. Before buying this mic though, I was actually using a $99 blue-yetting which just connected to the USB and it wasn't actually too bad. To start the filming process, I put my camera up on top of my bookshelf and then connected to the TV VHDMI. Then I set up the lights, put my mic in the mic stand and plug it into the Mackey with an acceler cable. Next, I'll start recording with audition in the camera and then before I go through my script, I'll make some dumb faces so it's easy to find a shot for the video's thumbnail and finally I'll start recording. Typically, don't memorize my scripts with four filming. Actually, most of the time we're just listening to bullet points and this means that I just keep saying lines until I'm done with plenty of mistakes along the way. So, that's just a quick overview of my shooting process and this video was supposed to be a thank you for when we hit 10,000 subscribers and we are a little bit past that, oops. Still, thank you so much for the support and the feedback you've given me so far. This has been a ton of fun and I can't wait to keep making better and better videos every single week. Now, for the next bonus video, let's set the miles to an attene. How about 50,000 subscribers? But I actually wanna hear from you down in the comments. What kind of a bonus video aside from college tips and studying advice do you wanna see? And also, if you're still curious or have more questions about my shooting process or other parts of the video creation process, I'm actually doing a little mini series on my podcast but this week and next week over that entire process and you click the car to link down to the description if you want to listen to that episode. The first one's out right now and if you subscribe to the podcast, you'll get the second one when it comes out next Monday. So, that's all I've got for you today. Thanks so much for watching this bonus video and I will see you in my video over test anxiety coming out on Thursday.
