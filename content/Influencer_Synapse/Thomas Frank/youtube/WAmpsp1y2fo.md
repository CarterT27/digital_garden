Do you give creative, thought-intense tasks the time and respect they really need - or are you getting overly excited by tools and "hacks" that you try to rush through them?

This video goes over two simple techniques you can use to make sure you always have ample time to devote to this type of focused work.

## Transcript
 Hey, what's up everybody? I'm Tom from College InfoGeek.com and today I want to talk about a study tip that I recently learned when I interviewed somebody for my podcast and the guy interviewed his named Cal Newport and if you haven't heard of him, he's written a lot of different books for students that helped them be better in college and there's something he told me that really really stuck with me in the interview that I want to share with you So what Cal told me is creating things of value requires that you go to intellectual combat and this is something that I think I intrinsically knew and you might know yourself, but it's good to have it reiterated because when you want to create something, when you want to learn something or do something that's difficult, you really have to reach and dive deep and give it the time it deserves and I think that we don't give this concept enough respect in today's world. I'm guilty of it myself because I run this blog and I run this podcast in this YouTube channel and I want to share tools and techniques to make you more efficient but I think when we're focusing on these time management and task management tools and we're focusing on study tactics like space repetition, method of low-sy all this kind of stuff we don't give creative work and we don't give learning the respect they deserve. They really require concentrated, difficult effort. Learning is reaching and this is something we need to intrinsically know and understand when we build our schedules So recently I experimented with a productivity technique called Time Boxing and basically what Time Boxing is is you create a minute by hour by hour schedule of your entire week or maybe day or whatever time period you choose but you basically plan ahead what you're going to do hour by hour So I took a Sunday to plan all the content I wanted to create, all the video shooting wanted to do editing, I wanted to do blog posts, I wanted to write things I wanted to read, etc and I actually went hour by hour and said okay Monday morning I'm going to write 500 words for this post I'm going to work on then I'm going to start working on a video, I've got an interview to do, this is all scheduled out and my intent was that I would be externalizing some of the motivation to do all this work and I was hoping that I would be more productive because I would have this preset schedule that was driving me forward instead of me having to make a decision every time I finished task. Now I knew going into the Time Boxing experiment that this first week was going to be inaccurate because there's this thing called a Fudge ratio and a Fudge ratio is the difference between your mind's estimate of how long it's going to take to do a task and the actual amount of time it does take. The problem with human brains is we can't differentiate between best case scenario and the average case scenario so when we estimate the time it's going to take to do something we think of the average case it's going to take me 15 minutes to get to work but our minds are actually generating a best case scenario because we don't think of things that can go wrong and things do go wrong in the real world and we can't really think about these things that happened beforehand so hence the Fudge ratio, the time it takes beyond your initial estimate it's also called Hofstetter's Law so Douglas Hofstetter, the author of a book on my shelf, go to El Escherbach and a couple of other books said that Hofstetter's Law is you know take your time estimate for something and double it even if you're taking into account Hofstetter's Law already so it's kind of recursive and a teamer's but it does have a good point that you need to take your initial estimates and give it a Fudge ratio so it's probably going to take a little bit longer I tried to implement a Fudge ratio into my time boxing experiment but I knew it wouldn't be perfect and as I went through as you can see here on the screen there are a lot of boxes later on on the week that weren't checked off and there's a common thread between those boxes the common thread being these tasks were creative, thought intensive tasks and I didn't give them enough time for two reasons the first one and the base reason as I just didn't schedule enough time I didn't give these tasks the respect they deserved as somebody who's been writing for about four and a half years now I sort of assumed that I'm going to be able to create something really really good in a short amount of time but when I'm wrangling concepts that I don't know a whole lot about and when I need to do research and learn it does take longer and the other thing is I really sandwiched these creative thought intensive tasks between other things and the other things weren't always perfectly efficient I might not have gotten something done the exact time that I scheduled it so it sort of eats into the time that I've already scheduled for the creative task and as a result my brain goes I don't have time to think about you know I don't have time to really dive into this creative task I'm just not going to work on it and this is something that I learned during the time boxing experiment so if I do this again I know going forward that I have to respect the creative tasks I have to give them the time that they deserve so here's the best way that you can implement my experience into your own life number one think of your tasks in context there's two different contexts that I see for task management one is high thought intensity tasks tasks that really require you to think buckle down and reach and these tasks require a lot of time and dedicated effort uninterrupted work time there's also low intensity tasks things like doing your laundry going to you with friends going to classes things that don't require as much mental reaching and the best thing that you can do to really set yourself up for success on the high intensity tasks is batch the low intensity tasks so plan your week ahead in advance maybe take Sunday to do a whole week of planning if you can and think about what are all these low intensity tasks that I need to get done and how can I squeeze them into a few sections or a segments of work as possible doing this lets you have open time for the high intensity tasks time that you need to really dive in and work hard the other thing you can do is to do regular self evaluations to see what times of the day you are best primed to do high intensity tasks so maybe you are a really good morning writer or somebody who can study well in the early morning maybe it's early afternoon for you maybe you are a night hour and you found that like wow it's midnight to when I am and this is like my on fire time but be deliberate in paying attention to those times because when you do that you can intelligently schedule your classes, your social life and your work schedule around that to leave uninterrupted blocks of time at those optimal time of the day and if you notice the awkward jump cut there well I kind of forgot the exact language but it works right so those are the main ideas in this video number one, creating things of value and learning difficult material both require going to intellectual combat as Cal says you have to respect the task you have to give it the time it deserves and don't allow yourself to be interrupted during that work time the other two ideas are supporting this main idea number one, look at your tasks in term of context and try to batch the low intensity ones and secondly try to evaluate what the best times the day are for you to work by deliberately implementing these ideas into your life you're going to be a lot more efficient in your studying and get a lot more done Hey,
