 I'm going to be a hundred percent honest with you guys here. I am an absolute sucker for round of lists of app recommendations and I know I'm not the only one because I get asked by you guys for app recommendations all the time So here we are now my intention this week was to sit down and make a list of app recommendations for the iPhone and then I was going to come back next week And make a companion video for the Android people, but what I found out when I started making my list is that the majority of my picks are actually across platform these days with very few exceptions So instead of making two very redundant videos I decided just to take the iOS and Android have and smashed them together into one delicious peanut butter and jilly sandwich of a video and in this video I'm going to be giving you 10 specific productivity Recommendations you should check out and fittingly we're going to be starting with my to-do list recommendation Now when it comes to to-do list apps I personally use a very powerful app called Asana and I absolutely love it However Asana is built mainly for teams and it's got a lot of features You probably won't need if you're just managing your personal tasks So if you're not managing a team like I am I recommend one or list It's elegantly designed it has apps on iOS, Android and lots of other platforms and it doesn't lock essential features behind a paid version like some other to-do managers do Now every good task management app needs a calendar app as a companion and well Google calendar and I call are both good Fantasticel is my calendar app of choice the design is great It's one of the few calendar apps that features complication support on my Apple watch But the killer feature for me is the natural language processing instead of typing up events I can speak them in the Apple intelligently parse what I say and fill in event details opto magically Fantasticel does not have an Android version and the only Android app I could find that has a similar natural language feature is today calendar Which is around $5 after a free trial now if you don't want to pay that much and you can live without the language processing feature I'd recommend checking out Saul calendar for free full-featured alternative Habit tracking is another practice that helps me stay productive and my favorite app for that is Habitica along with a full-featured web app Habitica has iOS and Android apps that let you turn tracking your habits into a video game You can level up a character you can buy gear and you can join up with other people to go on quests and keep each other accountable You also find a collagen pogeet guild within Habitica that has over 7,000 members Now if those video game features aren't your cup of tea, but you still want to track your habits I'd recommend checking out an app on iOS called momentum which lets you simply open the app check a box and move on with your life You can also check out habits within iOS as today view, which is a really cool feature An Android check out habit bowl for something that has similar features for managing notes My app of choice has always been evernote this app is pretty much my second brain I write all my scripts in it. I take notes in it and I shove all sorts of information in it that I want to remember Now evernote is cross-platform, but if you own more than two devices, which is the limit on evernotes free tier You may want to give Microsoft's one note a look as a possible alternative I prefer evernote personally, but I am a premium user and the apps are pretty comparable And I think one note does offer more on the free tier than evernote does Anyway, well, evernote is keeping my notes managed and synced to keep files synced and backed up across all my devices I use Dropbox it integrates amazingly with a sauna, which lets me attach files to tasks and the blink of an eye and Overall, I consider it to be one of the most crucial tools in my work set up Next up, we've got scanable and at the let's do automatically scan documents and send them straight to evernote Other than my idea notebook and sketchbook, I try to keep my life as paperless as possible and scanable Let's me do that really really easily now if you're not nevernote user though I would check out scan bot, which offers a lot of different export options Additionally, it's also the app you should check out if you're on Android since scanable is an iPhone exclusive Now if you often find yourself getting distracted by your smartphone while you're working You've got a couple of different options number one turn it off, but number two if that doesn't work You can download forest, which is an app that rewards you for leading your phone alone by growing a virtual tree Now if you touch your phone before a session is up, the tree dies You also get a record of your progress and the positive reinforcement that provides may be just the thing you need to improve your focus Speaking of focus, one of my favorite ways of getting focused on a particular task is by using the Pomodoro technique and there are a ton of Pomodoro style timer apps out there Feel free to check out as many as you like, but on the iPhone I'd recommend going to focus keeper while those of you on Android should check out clear focus Lastly, one practice that helps me stay productive throughout the entire day is Exercising, which is why I use an app called these seven-minute workout pretty much every single day And this just helps me make sure that even on the days I don't go to the gym I'm still getting some exercise in so guys that is my list at least for this particular video Now I definitely have more apps on this bad boy that I use and want to share with you So I'm gonna do more app round-up videos in the future and if you've got Atpics of your own you can share them down in the comments below before I wrap this video up I did want to let you guys in on one more thing and that is that college info geek t-shirts are now in stock over at DFTBA.com and if I can stand on my tiptoes enough You can kind of see the shirt because I'm wearing it right now But you can see the full picture at the link in the description and if you click that link you can also buy a shirt if you want If you do get one and you want to send me a picture of it You can tweet me over at Tom frankly and you can also use my Twitter to ask me questions Which I'll use for future videos and future Q&A rapid fire lightning style round video things And that about does it for this big video guys So if you enjoyed it you want to get new videos every single week and being a more effective student You can click that subscribe button right over there And if you want to get a free copy of my book on earning better grades you can put the picture right there Like there to find another video you might enjoy you'll find more helpful resource links in the description below the like button Which you can hit is for this channel.
