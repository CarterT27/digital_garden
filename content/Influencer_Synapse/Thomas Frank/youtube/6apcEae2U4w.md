Nope, it's not a bucket list. The Impossible List is a goal-tracking tool that's iterative and evolves as you progress through life. 

I've been using mine since I was a sophomore, and I can confidently say it's the most useful "tool" out of any I have for making progress on my goals.

Here's my Impossible List:

 Hey, what's up guys, my name is Thomas Frank and today I'm actually wearing this shirt that I've worn in many other videos for a good reason because it is high time We talked about the impossible list So I've been in several classes in situations before our students are asked to give their goals and all too often I hear this really limited answer Where a student will say they simply want to graduate and get a good ping job and yeah, that's an honorable goal But I think it's really limiting yourself if you only want to get a high ping job and you think about nothing else Then what happens when you graduate get that job and find yourself in a life situation you really can't stand I think situations like this are easily avoidable if you take the time to think about each individual aspect of your life Outside of your career when you're setting your goals So that brings me to my impossible list. This is a tool that I've been using for the past three or four years To specifically and publicly set down my goals and then show one of achieve them now I didn't come up with this idea on my own. I actually got it from a guy named Joel Runny and who runs a site called ImpossibleHQ.com and he built his impossible list when he had graduated from college and couldn't find a job And today he's used it to run ultra marathons help build schools and other countries and do all sorts of awesome stuff And when I found it, I knew I had to make my own so essentially my impossible list is just the list of all the things I want to do with my life categorized by type. I have health goals. I have financial goals. I have professional goals charity goals, skill goals, all sorts of goals And I have them specifically written down and Public on my website now you might look at my impossible list and think it looks like a bucket list and it has some similarities But it also has some key differences that I want to go over right now for one a bucket list doesn't really inspire you to take action right now It's kind of a list of things you'd like to do and like to be able to look back and say you did before you die But the impossible list is more active. It demands action right now It demands a plan and it's also iterative So if you look at my impossible list you'll see goals on there with lines through them But you'll also see sub bullet points beneath them with goals that are similar But even more challenging when I achieve something more often than not I'll find something that's even harder and iteration on that previous goal and write it down This makes the impossibleist concept fundamentally different from a bucket list because the bucket list is static and it gets smaller as you go on You cross things off and there are limited amount of things left on it on the other hand The impossibleist encourages you to evolve and encourages you to think about the journey and keep progressing keep getting better Now like I said, I can't take credit for this idea Joel's the one who came up with it and I'm incredibly thankful I came across his blog and kind of stole the idea for myself But I have added a couple of extra features that I think make it even more useful if you look at the top of my Impossible list you'll see two extra sections that aren't on Joel's list Number one is in the last five completed goals and I added that there because as a student I was always really afraid that I would graduate and get in a comfortable life situation where I was making enough money and then stop progressing I was really afraid that I would rest on my laurels stop getting outside of my comfort zone stop learning and I really didn't want this to happen So the last five completed goal section Let's me look at the things I've done and how recently I've done the last one if there's been a long times I've completed something that I know I need to get myself back into gear having that section there and having a public keeps me accountable and keeps me progressing keeps me staying uncomfortable the other addition is the top section of my Impossible list and it's my current focuses there I list the three to four things that I'm really focusing on because I know as somebody who wants to achieve a lot of different things It can be hard to pick one or two to really focus on at one time and when you're juggling a lot of different things It once I'm not very much progress is gonna be made So by listing my current focuses I can always look at my Impossible list and say this is what I have committed to achieving right now And if I want to work on something else I need to physically edit the list take the old thing off and put the new thing on there So that's an overview of my own Impossible list and to round this video out I actually want to challenge you to create your own so if you want to get started on making your own list and want to do it in a really simple way Just grab a piece of paper create your gold categories right your goals down and then make sure you put it up in a place that you're gonna see Often the one thing I'll say with putting it on paper though is that you want to leave room to iterate when you cross off a goal You want to have someplace where you can write another goal that's an extension of that first one You can also choose to make it in a digital format which does make it easier to edit and if you want to do it I did and put it on your own website where it's more public and you're held more accountable Then I've got a guide on how you can build your own blog on my website, which incidentally is the longest blog post I've ever written But you can find it by going right there or clicking the link in the description as a side note I've also had employers bring up my list during interviews in the past and whether or not it helped me get a job It definitely made the conversation more memorable if you don't want to build your own custom website You can easily use like a free blogging platform like Tumblr or you can even put it in a public evernote document I think the two most important considerations when building your list though are that it's in a place where you see it very often Whether that's public or not and also that it's easily changeable so keep those in mind when building your list If you want to check out my list so you can get some inspiration then click the annotation right there or the link in the description And feel free to steal any of the features and goals that I have on there if you do end up making your own list And you make a public that I'd love to see it and you can tweet me the link over at Tom Frankley or just leave a comment down below That's it for this video.
