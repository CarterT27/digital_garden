# Dealing with Negative People: Advice from a Roman Emperor
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWUoXcuruP4
I believe happiness is 10% circumstances and 90% attitude. 

How you react to your circumstances makes the biggest impact - and the way you choose to deal with negative people is no exception.

As the ruler of a vast empire, Marcus Aurelius had to deal with negative people on a daily basis. In his writings - the self-addressed Meditations - Aurelius provides us with a quote about dealing with negative people that I find to be an incredibly helpful reminder for setting my attitude.

## Transcript
 At some point in your life, you've probably heard about the concept of Arkham's Razor, which states that when you have multiple competing hypotheses, you should take the one that makes the fewest assumptions, because generally speaking, the simplest answer is the one that's most likely to be correct, but Arkham's Razor isn't the only mental Razor you should keep up in your reign toolbox. There's another one called Hayland's Razor, and this one deals with the intentions of other people. Hayland's Razor states that you should never attribute to Malice, that which can be adequately explained by stupidity. And while this is kind of a tongue-in-cheat concept, I also think there is a lot of truth to it. And I've tried really hard to integrate it into my own mindset on a day-to-day basis, and I think doing so makes me an overall happier person by making sure my attitude is that correct. A few months ago, I've been a book called The Happiness Equation by Guy named Neil Pusricha, and in this book, Neil argues that happiness is 90% attitude and only 10% circumstance, and when I look back at my own life, I agree with this. When I look back six or seven years, I was definitely less successful as a freshman in college. I had less money. I had a lot more uncertainty, but I wasn't unhappy. And I don't think that I'm a whole lot happier on a day-to-day basis now than I was back then, because my attitude was similar both now and then. And when I'm thinking about these concepts of happiness and attitude, and looking at them through the lens of dealing with other people, as Hans Rayser leads him to do, I'm reminded of a quote by the Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius, which I really want to share with you guys today. Now, in Roman history, Aurelius is known as the last of the five good emperors. And while he was definitely a great ruler, he was also a great philosopher in the philosophy of stoicism, and his writings, which have been collected in the book Meditation, are where this quote comes from. So in book two Meditations, Aurelius writes, when you wake up in the morning, tell yourself, the people ideal with today will be meddling, ungrateful, arrogant, dishonest, jealous, and surreal. They're like this because they can't tell good from evil, but I have seen the beauty of good and the uglyness of you. And it recognized that the wrongdoer has a nature related to my own, now to the same blood or birth, but to the same mind, and possessing a share of the divine. And so none of them can hurt me. No one can implicate me in uglyness. Nor can I feel angry in my relative or hate him. We were born to work together like feet, hands, eyes, like the two rows of teeth, upper, and lower. To obstruct each other is unnatural, to feel anger at someone, to turn your back on it. These are obstructions. I think this is a really powerful quote, and I wanted to give you my little interpretation of it here, basically that 2016 Thomas Frank version 2000 years later. So when somebody is being jealous or being rude or coming at you in any sort of negative way, you can realize that you are of the same nature. You are both imperfect human beings going through imperfect circumstances within this world. And when you realize that you can root yourself like a tree and bend, not break, because you realize that whatever you're going through, that is most likely what's causing them to act this way. And once you do that, number one, it can set your attitude and make you a happier person overall, because you've let the negativity wash over you instead of fuel you and make you react in a negative way yourself. But number two, it can let you get to the other part of human nature, which is to cooperate with your fellow human beings. So hopefully you found this quote helpful and insightful like I did, and if you want to read the entirety of meditations, which actually isn't all that long, you can find the whole thing online for free because it is 2000 years old and hence in the public domain. So I'm going to have a link down in the description below if you're curious, you can find that down there.
