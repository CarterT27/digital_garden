As a scary talking clock once told me, time is a tool you can put on the wall or wear upon your wrist.

Problem is, things often take more time than we think they will - which leads some people to be habitually late (even with the best of intentions).

Here are my tips for never being late again.

 Hey, what's going on guys? So I got a few questions lately about how to stop being late to things and I thought this would be a good topic to cover because some of us do have problems getting ourselves the things on time even if we're not jerks who don't respect the time of others We simply have other problems or brain bugs that cause us to be habitually late So in today's video I've got five specific tips that can hopefully help you become the most punctual person in your friend group And the first couple that we're going to tackle what I think is the main problem that makes people so late, which is that we as humans are very bad at making accurate time estimates And we are susceptible to something called the planning fallacy, which describes how basically we are over optimistic in our estimations And the first thing you can start doing to fight against this planning fallacy is to start envisioning the entire sequence of steps that's going to take to get you from whatever you're doing right now to your next scheduled event And the reason that you should do this is because it puts you on the right side of what's called the segmentation effect And this effect basically describes how people make shorter time estimations for an entire task Then their time estimations for the sum total of all the sub tasks where they to break that task down And the reason this happens is because we tend to fixate on the most important part or the part that's going to take the longest A perfect example is transit time if I need to get somewhere my brain tends to naturally fixate on how long it's going to take to get there So I might think oh I need to get to a coffee shop in the next town over it's going to take 25 minutes to drive there And if I were to actually write down all the steps involved and getting up from my desk and getting myself into the building, which I actually did, I can find out that this is actually a 16 step process And there's about eight minutes of extra steps involved so instead of budgeting 25 minutes to get there I should budget 34 And in reality this is actually not enough time because like I said the planning fallacy has a pretty tight grip on our brains We are over optimistic in our time estimations and this is a natural brain book in fact researchers at the University of Waterloo in Canada found this out by asking people to make two different types of time estimations for completing a task They ask people for best guests scenarios basically like the everyday run of the male average case and they also ask people for hopeful ideal best case scenario guesses And the results were virtually identical for both cases which indicates that we only see the ideal scenario when we try to plan how long it's going to take to do something We don't think about the grandma that's going to be driving five miles an hour in front of us. We don't think about the ninjas that are going to attack us on our way to school. These things happen, right? We don't plan for the things that will go wrong, but there's a natural distribution of outcomes for any event both good and bad And our brains just tend to fix it on that perfect ideal tiny little end of the bell curve where everything goes right and very rarely is that actually going to be what happens Now with a lot of practice and experience I found that it is possible to get over this tendency to be over optimistic, but an interim solution is to use what's called a flood ratio And this is a concept that was created by the writer and blogger Steve Pavlina and it's basically the difference between your time estimate for something and the actual time it takes For example, if you thought it would take 30 minutes to go to the store and it actually takes you 45 then your fundraiser ratio is 1.5 and what he recommend to do is to keep this number in mind and apply it as like a second step in your brain like a revision step to all your future time estimates for similar tasks Now with a third tip of got for you guys we're going to attack the problem from a different angle tips one and two we're about estimating more accurately and trying to envision all the steps and tip number three is To simply remove steps by doing stuff in advance. If you pack your bag the night before when you go to bed or you lay all your clothes in advance Or maybe you like bulk cook your meals so you can just wake up and microwave them Then you've got less to do in the morning or whenever you need to start doing stuff and less steps that you have to go through in any process The easier it's going to be to estimate how long it'll take, but more importantly the fewer instances there are for things to go wrong, right? A simpler process has fewer points of failure than a complicated one All right, so now that we've moved through tips for making your time estimates more accurate and for making your processes simpler My penultimate tip or fourth tip for you guys is to schedule an end time to task that you're currently doing and the reasons that we want to do this are Number one sometimes we just get caught up in our work and we don't realize we need to get going to our next thing and number two Sometimes we do know we need to get going to the next thing, but our brains are kind of like being rewarded for whatever we're doing right now Maybe we're on Facebook or maybe we're like really into the work we're doing or playing a video game and And the, you know, the old part of your brain, the limbic system that's kind of getting all the dopamine hits is basically like a little kid petitioning its mom saying like just one more minute, just one more minute, right? And your preferential cortex, you know, the more controlally part of your brain has to be the mom and say, no, it's bedtime, turn off the freaking video games, turn off the ego, it's time to go to bed And bed is probably class, but, you know, what I found is that an external system is much better at being a mom for the old part of your brain than your PFC is So use an alarm maybe use a Pomodoro session that ends five minutes before your next task needs to begin Or maybe just have an alarm on your phone that says it's time to start winding down that way your brain is going to be able to kind of boot itself out of whatever you're doing right now and start doing the next thing when it actually needs to do it And finally my last tip is for any of you guys that find yourselves forgetting events either forgetting them entirely and completely missing them or forgetting them until like five minutes before they're going to start which results in a panic attack, right? Neither is a good situation and luckily both can be completely rectified just by using a calendar efficiently Like the productivity guru David Allen once said your brain is for having ideas not storing them This is true even if you have some weird genius brain that can remember 99% of all the events that you have to go to and I can tell you mine is not like that I can probably remember maybe 75% and usually those are only the fun ones But my calendar is always going to remember 100% of everything that I put into it unless evil hackers somehow get into it and I've got pretty strong passwords So get into the habit of putting events into your calendar the moment they come up on your schedule get them out of your brain And into a quick capture system I like to call it so it's basically in a steel trap that you trust and I'd also recommend setting up reminder notifications for your events Now part of my morning routine is to wake up and immediately check my calendar so I know exactly what's going to happen that day But for certain events I want to make darn sure that I'm going to get to them on time So I'll use Google calendars reminder feature to set maybe like an hour before notification to come to my phone All right, so those are the tips I've got for you in this video and if you're able to implement them all into your life You are likely to become the most punctual person in your group of friends Which will give you the honor and privilege of being annoyed at all the friends who are perpetually late now that you aren't But hey, you could just send in this video, right? So hopefully you found this helpful if you got additional tips I would love to hear about them down in the comments And you can also check out the blog post for this video, which has got some extra details and links to some cool scientific studies about why our brains are broken and overoptimistic If you enjoyed this video, you can give it a thumbs up to support this channel and if you want to get new tips every single week on being a more effective student You can click that big red subscribe button down there You can also get a free copy of the book I wrote on earning better grades by clicking the picture of said book right over there And if you missed last week's video, I was about how to wake up early So if that's something you want to do and you missed it check it out right there Once again, if you want to check out that companion article which has extra details and resource links You can click the button right there And if you'd like to connect with me, well, you're probably going to need a rooftop in a spotlight because All I'm saying is have you ever seen Batman and me in the same room at the same time?
