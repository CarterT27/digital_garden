 Hey, what's up guys? So today I am really excited to finally announce the launch of something that I have been wanting to build for years I kept it up in my head as an idea for a long time But finally last week I got around to building it and there is now an official community for college info geek And I decided to set up as a subreddit on reddit.com and I'll kind of explain the choice of that platform in a minute But first I kind of want to tell you kind of my overall idea for what I hope this community can be and if you want to check it out The URL is collegeinpogeek.com slash community you can check it out right there and Essentially what I want to make this is like the premiere place for us to have discussions for questions to be answered for Discussion to be had around videos because YouTube comments while they're cool and it's always great to get feedback on them on the videos I make YouTube comments and blog comments like wise or are just set up for Reactions or the video maker like you watch a video and then you can react to it You can respond to it and then people can reply to your comments That's true, but these systems are not set up to promote good discussion between multiple people in the audience between like me and multiple people at once and Likewise my email is only set up for me to be able to correspond with one person at a time And if I answer a question on my email then only one person gets to see that answer So I've always wanted to set up like some sort of discussion forum where we can all help each other out And we're all those answers can be visible and we're good discussion can be promoted I chose reddit because I've been on reddit for four years and I've gotten a lot of value out of the site There's certainly like certain areas the site with trolls and sarcastic people But in my experience the smaller interest-based subreddits where people are trying to learn new skills They're just get better at things in general those are always overflowing with positivity and people just trying to help each other out And that's one kind of hoping this community will be and I actually wanted to test that before I went live and told everyone about it So I set it up last Tuesday. I think is when I went live and I kind of just told like a little small percentage of the people who are subscribed to the newsletter So we've been having discussions in there for the past week and it's going great And I would love for you to join in and help this subreddit grow to become like the premier place for discussions to happen around my videos That's kind of like the first purpose of this community I'm gonna be making a discussion thread for every new video going forward And you'll find it linked in the description for those videos and I'm kind of hoping that most of the good discussion On new videos can go over there where people can up both the best comments and where replies are much easier for me to see I will say that it's like it's pretty hard for me to see replies to comments on YouTube I can see the new ones, but it's really hard for me to see like replies and I'm reddit That's really really easy for me to see so discussion for videos is gonna be there I'm also gonna try to be answering most questions for them you guys over on the community rather than email because like I said with email Only one person can benefit from that answer and to be honest It's really hard for me to answer questions in the first place like I can answer a few but all of them just kind of get to overwhelming with the rest of the work I have to do but with the community I'll be able to answer just as many as I was via email But also there's so many of you guys out there who already have lots of answers and knowledge and experience that I don't have So if you've got a question, there's likely gonna be somebody else who can provide an answer and you can go to see the threads right now in the community I'm pretty sure every thread there right now has an answer from someone even if it's not me So ask your questions there also if you have Tips of your own or experiences that you want to post about they can definitely benefit other students and if you've got topics So you'd like to see me cover on the channel in the future or maybe guests that would be good on the college in Bogeek podcast I'm gonna be making a Official topic request thread that'll be at the top of the community every single month So if you put your requests there, it'll be like a nice place to consolidate them and I can kind of see which ones people are Upboating and which ones I should make next. Also, this is kind of a way to hand a little bit of the control this project to you guys Because I'm really open to your ideas and I want to hear like how we can make this College of Bogeek is a project overall better for students all over the world So if you have ideas, there's gonna be an official discussion thread for this launch video I'll have it linked down in the description below and I would love to hear your ideas for what we can do in the community to make it better Maybe we can have like monthly discussion threads in certain topics where you guys can submit your ideas your best tips Or maybe favorite apps and tools things like that and otherwise. Yeah, just let me know which you think and I would absolutely love to see you in the community You can subscribe using reddit. It's really easy to create an account and there's also apps for pretty much every smartphone That can make it really easy to browse on the go so see you over in the community and as always.
