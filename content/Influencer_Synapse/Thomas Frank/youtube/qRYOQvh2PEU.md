 Hey guys, it's Thomas Frank and as you can see from the video title, this is a little bit of a room tour and the reason for that is that I've been getting a few requests for it and I just wanted to do it as I thank you because We just passed 5,000 subscribers over the weekend and I just really want to say thank you because I never expected the channel to grow this fast and It really validates a lot of the work I'm doing to see people watching and commenting and subscribing to all that cool stuff so seriously Thank you so much again I'm gonna keep putting more effort into making these videos better and better and covering all the topics You guys are requesting so definitely keep asking questions, but yeah for this 5,000 subscriber milestone I just wanted to show you the room that I work in some of the gear that I used to make videos and Podcasts and all other kind of stuff in this room When I hit 10,000 I think I'm gonna do a video about how I make videos Maybe the shooting process and how I set up, but you'll have to wait until 10,000 for that So until then enjoy this room tour
