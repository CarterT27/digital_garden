 Hey, what's up everybody? I'm Thomas from College in Bogeek and with this video I'm gonna make it really short because I have one singular purpose and that is to rip from your vocabular The words I don't feel like it. I don't feel like it is a tragically common phrase for people who are students and for people who work in creative fields And it's really something that limits your potential and that limits your productivity when you're trying to get things done Here's the thing about I don't feel like it When you say it when you think it when you feel it it doesn't change what you can do next It does nothing to actually limit your decisions going forward So when you say I don't feel like it you're simply giving yourself an excuse not to do the work that you know You need to do it doesn't actually prevent you from opening your laptop and typing a paper It doesn't actually prevent you from opening a book and studying for a while It just lets you give yourself an excuse to not do those things The writer James Clear said that the difference between professionals and amateurs are that amateurs Way until they feel inspired to do creative work and professionals do it on a strict schedule One of his friends said that yes, I wait until I'm inspired to do my work It just so happens is that my inspiration comes at 8 a.m. every single day And if you look at a lot of other famous writers and creatives They stick to strict schedules and do the same amount of work every day So here's how you can apply this mindset to your life as a student You have a lot of studying to do you got a lot of projects to work on homework assignments all this different stuff And you don't always have the will power to do it, but that doesn't matter Because you can just say I'm going to do it and here's a tip you can use to improve your success in using this mindset Give yourself permission to create imperfect work a lot of writers swear by the concept of creating shitty first drafts Just sitting down and writing whatever comes to mind no matter how bad it is Weight lifters are the same they go to the gym and work out every day Even if they feel like they're not going to put up good numbers that day as a student if you want to study something You don't have to feel like you need to learn every single thing in one study session You could just learn one thing or two things or simply open the book and make an attempt It's the same with homework assignments. Don't feel like you need to get everything done Just feel like you need to start once you've gained a little bit of momentum and you've finished a few problems The rest of these assignments will be easier to complete adopting this mindset that I don't feel like it Doesn't matter will help you going forward if a lot of your productivity problems Sure, there's all sorts of techniques and tricks we can use but when it comes down to it It's great. It's having the mental toughness to say it doesn't matter if I don't feel like it I'm gonna get this done or I'm at least going to start and when you come in and do this day after day after day Progress is made progress that would be made if you simply said I don't feel like it and let that really your life Hey, thanks for watching my video If you enjoyed it, then you can support me by giving it a like on YouTube or sharing it with a friend You want to get more videos just like this every single week on being a better college student then click subscribe button right there If this last video a clip of it is playing right below there, you can click that to watch it Also, you can get a summary and links to anything I mentioned in the video by going to the companion blog post Which you can find by clicking on the orange logo right there Lastly, if you want to get a free chapter of my book, but it comes out then you can click that book and subscribe to the college It would be newsletter.
