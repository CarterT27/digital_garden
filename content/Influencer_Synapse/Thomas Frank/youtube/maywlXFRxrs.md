 To use the technical term this video is about how to get a buttload of work done now the definition of a standard buttload It has been in dispute for years, but regardless if you're watching this video You probably feel like you have that resting on your shoulders So as somebody who went from being an overly involved college student straight into being an overly ideal-laden Content creator entrepreneur, whatever you want to call me I feel like I always have a lot of work resting on my shoulders and I tend to get a lot of it done Which leads to the question? I get emailed often. How do you get so much work done? Well, let's Move back a little bit first into this perception of how much work we have to do when people ask us how we're doing What's the answer we usually give them? That's right. It's usually I'm just so busy The word busy is just so commonly uttered from our mouths and I want to challenge you on this assumption What does busy really mean? Now for all the crappy gets Thomas Edison actually said something pretty smart on this subject And I'm gonna read it off my phone real quick because it didn't memorize it. Being busy does not mean real work The object of all work is production or accomplishment and to either of these ends There must be forethought system planning intelligence on as purpose as well as perspiration Seeming to do is not doing now That's something you should really take to heart. How much of your time is seeming to do and how much of it is actually spent doing and getting real things accomplished Producing real work of real value for the past few months. It seems like I've actually been able to produce a lot more work than I used to in the past And if I look through the archives on my blog It seems like for a couple of years. I was only putting out maybe five things a month at most now I'm creating videos almost every week I'm doing my podcast every week blog posts episodes of listen money matters another podcast some a part of and I wrote a book in a few months Which just came out a couple of weeks ago. So how is I able to increase this output and go from just being busy all the time and Feeling sorry for myself about how much work I had on my shoulders to actually getting things done Well to be honest, I could attribute this to a lot of factors motivation habits planning time management task management Efficiency delegation hiring people there's all sorts of things that go into getting work done on top of the just the simple discipline of sitting down and working And I could devote videos to every single one of these topics and many of them will get videos in the future But the topic I want to focus on in this video is the act of planning Specifically daily planning what we want to get away from here is this feeling of being busy and not actually getting a whole lot Done not really focusing on any specific task you have to do and you're probably familiar with some of the common cases where this happens You're in the library. You've got all your material out in front of you, but you don't really know which things should study So now you're on Facebook daily planning Aliviates this problem because if you do it right you know exactly what you should be doing at any given time for instance My morning routine is a form of a daily plan the moment I wake up in the morning I know exactly what I need to do. I need to come to my apartment I need to turn off my wake-up alarm that I talked about in another video and then I need to immediately meditate Go into my seven minute workout go for a walk make breakfast read books, et cetera I know exactly what I need to do and as a result I do it So at morning routines are incredibly important But I want to talk about the actual daily plan that encompasses your specific tasks that you need to get done Whenever I get a new task that needs to be done at some point in time, it goes straight into to do is And to do is is that to do up a choice that I use there are a lot others out there But it's the first point of contact for any task I have it is not the only place where tasks end up living in my system On Sundays, I create a weekly plan in a paper notebook really simple and write down exactly what I want to accomplish that week Then when I wake up in the morning and go through my morning routine I have a habit which is to simply create a daily plan So on that whiteboard right over there, I write my daily plan every single morning and I put the day of the week of the top and then I write down the 6 to 7 maybe 8 if I'm feeling really productive that day things that I need to get done and I don't stop there Though I try to estimate when each task should be done by so I'll put a dash and then I'll put the time When I'm estimating these times, I try to take into account a Fudraceo and this is a concept that I wrote about in my book and basically it's Taking the time I estimate to get things done and applying a little bit of a buffer to it because we are very bad at Planning for things that go wrong We're very bad at planning for inefficiencies and we tend to take the best best case scenario as a guess for when we estimate times So now that I have this daily plan I have a list of tasks in the order that I need to do them I have an estimate for the time that each one should be done and now I know at any given time What I should be doing once I'm done with my morning routine? I jump right into the first one and try as best as I can to get it done by the time I estimate it Seeing it right on the board next to me reminds me that that's what I should be working on I don't let myself get distracted by other things now Let's not to say that I'm absolutely perfect about getting the list done every day But combined with other productivity techniques that I apply to my life like habit tracking and Commitment devices and the Pomodoro technique and things like that It's actually really effective and my output has gone from here to here I'm not exactly sure what those are but There's a gap so go less than as clear here if you want to get a lot of things done You need to plan your day out in advance and then stick to that plan doing so We'll let you know what to focus on on any given moment and you'll spend a lot less time feeling busy But not getting much work done.
