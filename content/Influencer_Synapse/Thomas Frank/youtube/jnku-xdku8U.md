# Study with Me - A 1 Hour, Real-Time Study Session for 2019
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnku-xdku8U
By popular request, here is an hour-long study session, which may give you some extra motivation if you're studying for final exams. 

You can use this like an extra-long Pomodoro timer:

1. Pick a single task to work on.
2. Play the video (or use a Pomodoro app if you like).
3. Stay focused on that one task for the entire 60 minutes.
4. If something interrupts you, jot down a quick note about it and then get back to work.
5. Once the timer goes off, take a 5-10 minute break.
6. If you still need to study or keep working, repeat the process.

I take a minute-long break in the middle to stretch, and I suggest you do the same!
