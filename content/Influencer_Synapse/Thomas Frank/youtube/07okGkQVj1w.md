Greetings from Osaka, Japan! This is my Day 5 review of my accelerated Japanese learning challenge. Today I'll show you the technique that's helping me learn a lot of Japanese very quickly: sentence lists.

If you don't know what the heck this video is about... in short, it's my way of being able to go on vacation without letting the channel die for a month :)

Here's the overview video I did about the challenge: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjU8ukIOAdA

 Hello friends and welcome to my day five accelerated Japanese challenge learning over at you thingy From Osaka Japan, we just got here, and Yeah, so I wanted to tell you a little bit about what I did in the first half of my learning challenge Basically, I relearned all of here gone in Katekana to have the more simple Slaveries or alphabets as you can call them in Japanese I also went through the first two chapters of textbook who the online Japanese textbook that I talked about in the last video Just to kind of give myself a refresher and the most important thing I did was created a list of sentences in ever note that I wanted to be able to say And that's what I want to recommend to you to do if you're learning a language in this video So it basically I created a big list of all the things I wanted to say I made it as very as possible But I also tried to make the sentences things that I would actually need to say in Japan things like Eukudata Scott and how much is this? Things like where is the bathroom? How much is it to stay here? Things like that things that I would actually want to be able to talk to Japanese people about and Learning these would enable me to actually be functional in the country and it's also a very fast way to learn a language So basically if you want to do this just create a list and ever note Start using Google translate to get a starting point as to how to put the grammar and send structure together And then maybe even hire a tour on a site like I talking to get some instruction Now this isn't something I had done within the first five days of the challenge But I did do it in the next five days and I'll talk about that next time now This is just kind of an extension of the active learning concept It's just active recall on forcing yourself to do things with the intent of actually using it And if you want some more detail on this idea Tim Ferriss actually did a talk on his His method for rapid skill acquisition and basically he deconstructs a skill then selects a little bitty parts of it That actually wants to use and that's how we learn things rapidly So if you want to see that I've actually embedded that talk in the blog post for this video Would you find linked down in the description below and we're gonna go see the aquarium in Osaka so see you in that next video You
