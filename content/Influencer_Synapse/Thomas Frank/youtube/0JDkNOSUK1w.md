Studying in your room can be a challenge, since there are usually a ton of distractions within arms' reach.

Today my roommate Martin and I go over his solution for creating an isolated, distraction-free study area in his room.

## Transcript
 What's up guys, so I know you've asked me how to create a study space in the past and today I was going to show you my room, but I'm going to switch it up because literally last night My roommate Martin, who was back there Yeah Changes room around and I think his idea for a study space is actually better than mine So I'm going to have him show it to you and walk it through it in this quick video There's like me in the brain, I'll just... Because I like doing anything like obviously I need to say more than It's basically two tables with a showgees curve What's up? That's it Actually, you could literally do that Well before I actually tried to separate this out so that it was a gaming table in a work table Also, but they were on opposing walls The problem then was that I knew that I was in the same room It felt like one room and I wanted it to feel like it was a completely separate space So there was a bit of mental separation between work and play So you got one desk here, all the gaming stuff, what else is around this side? But we're on this side, we've got all my books, we've got a guitar and a closet, some Pokemon stuff And basically all sorts of non-focused non-productive things So this is like a completely separate room of us Yeah, and like it feels like a separate room when you get in here The shows you screen in the middle really makes a big difference And I think I legitimately feel like I'm entering a different room in the house Even though I know I'm just a foot away from my other things Where'd you get that thing? I stole it from my friend Clon Yeah, you did, but you can get it on Amazon as well for 50 bucks I think Alright, so this is the roost stand It is meant to raise the screen because ergonomically you want the top of your monitor to be at your eye level Okay, now what's cool about this is that it's extremely portable It's freaking cool So you can bring it with you anywhere to a cafe, to a library, to your friend's house If you need to do work or hotel, I'm going to work on a hotel And then we've got this keyboard stand, which is basically the keyboard stand But it's got these real rubber parts, so won't slide on your pants And you can pull out a slideable mouse pad So that you can work with the screen at the correct level And your keyboard at the correct level for your arms as well So basically, you're not even using the table to work on at all No, you can take this off of the table and put it on something Literally just a little square in front of me and it worked just the same And because this has adjustable height It's incredibly flexible I don't want to work anywhere So what else I have on the desk, I've got my noise cancel and wire, it was headphones over there This Moly Skin A notebook, which I've just got a daily schedule that I wrote out this morning So that I could pay attention I used to do that in Google Calendar, but I found that checking my phone every three seconds To check Google Calendar was really distracting Which is why my phone's way over there, not being touched So I've got this whiteboard up on an easel And I basically use this right now I've got some simple habits and things that are sort of a template For my daily schedule, then I'm writing out, like put somewhere to read, put somewhere to study Spanish And on this one here, I write down ideas If I think of, I need to do laundry, I need to run this errand But I haven't scheduled it in today Instead of letting it completely throw off today's work I put it here and then schedule it in tomorrow morning Why whiteboards on whiteboards? Because, like, are you exhibit or something? Because, I can take this off and go plan things somewhere else if I need to Okay, so I'm gonna use this for, if I'm drawing in the other room, I'm planning out like a web thing And I don't want to be in here Oh, that's cool So, it doesn't need to be on here, but it's a good place to store it And you clearly have a message that doesn't, like, never leave your whiteboard out Oh, yeah, so what does the store end this thing? I had my girlfriend write, don't overthink it on there Because overthinking it is probably my biggest weakness Because I will spend just hours and hours trying to solve something And I could have done something that worked within the first 10 minutes If I get caught up, say I'm editing a podcast and I get caught up on a single vocal pause that I can't remove Like, I will just remember, don't overthink it No one is even gonna notice that vocal pause, just leave it if you can't get rid of it That's smart So, I get the markers, I get the eraser Yeah The beat things have been useful several times The most recent use of them was I tore up a piece of printer paper I don't want you pieces, wrote down ideas I cashed them with magnets so that I could slide them around the board And rearrange them anyway I wanted That way I could determine what order to do things in What you can connect them, drawing lines between them and writing things It's just good for brainstorming We've got a couple more things We've got, uh, I've got a zaafu here for meditation We've got a glass keypots and some tea cups because I'm super zen But that's pretty much it I just did this because I've been craving that mental separation between work and play And I don't have enough to pay for an office right now outside my house So guys, that about does it for this video Just want to eat you a quick look at Martin's room Which I think is set up in pretty cool way And additionally, if you don't know, Martin is my co-host over on the college info geek podcast For every single Monday, we take three of your questions and answer them In a half an hour Q&A style show So if you want to subscribe and if you haven't done so already CIGpodcast.com is the URL you can go to But I'll also have a link down in the description below And if you want to subscribe to this channel and haven't done so You can click right there to get new videos Every single week, both on desk tour stuff We're going to do one of my room pretty soon And on productivity tips and other tips that can help you meet A more effective student You can also click right there to get free copy of my book If you want, and you can smash your face onto your phone screen right there Or click either one works See you in another video Thanks for watching, I'll see you next week
