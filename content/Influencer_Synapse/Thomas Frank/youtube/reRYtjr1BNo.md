# Study With Me - A 45-Minute Focused Study Session
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=reRYtjr1BNo
By request, here's a 45-minute study session video. You can use this like a longer Pomodoro timer:

1. Pick a single task.
2. Play the video (or use a Pomodoro app if you like).
3. Focus on nothing but that task for the 45 minutes.
4. Once the timer goes off, take a 5 or 10 minute break.
5. Repeat.

If you have headphones, pair this video with one of these:

- Coffitivity (coffee shop ambience) - https://coffitivity.com/
