 We are rapidly approaching final exams right now, so hopefully you're aspiring to greatness because greatness is what proceeds The growing of a great beard. So if you feel a little bit of prickly stubble coming in well, you know your aspirations are on the right place Anyway, today we are going to talk about how to not make dumb mistakes on exams I have an email about this question a lot and I want to tackle 10 ways you can stop making those stupid mistakes, but first the quick recap Our drill saluting causes of stupid mistakes on exams Therefore if you have not yet seen that video, it is highly recommended that you put the card right now and do your high balls to it Also, this is not Thomas. It is obvious. It's not so good. Let's go to the car. Would I lie to you? All right, so at the end of the way, let's get into our first tip and just to warn you some of these might seem a little bit obvious But as is my MO, I want to be pretty comprehensive in addition to brief so even if you've heard these before Try to put them into practice. So number one Be aware of the time you have for your test and aim to finish early. Put some time pressure on yourself Just like with your homework assignments time pressure can help you in the context. I'm an exam So if you've got 50 minutes prepare to finish in 45 that way you've got time to double check later Speaking of double checking that is tip number two So put the kabashi on the eye. Don't feel like it mindset when it comes to doing it because I know it's a pain in the butt But five extra minutes in the testing room going over your answers can mean the difference between an A and a B and What were you gonna do with that extra five minutes anyway like go on read it back at your door or something? So double check those answers tip number three has to do with tests that you scan Tron bubble sheets and that's something that I used to do in my own tests So basically when you've read a question on the test and you figured out the answer Then you're about to transfer it over to that bubble sheet first either lightly touch your pencil or your finger To the letter of the answer and then say the letter in your head that will drastically cut down the chance that you'll bubble in the wrong letter on your scan Tron sheet, which is an incredibly common error on that test format Tip number four has to do with the work you do on scratch paper and it's simply to draw a box around each problem's work That way when you're looking at your scratch paper to fill in an answer You don't accidentally pull data from a different problem Tip number five is to slow down and read the questions fully Watch out for trick wording a lot of questions might say which of these is not instead of which of these is So if you tend to read questions too quickly and you're making mistakes then use a pacing device like your finger Simply move it along the text to the problem and let your eyes be paced by that finger I do this every single week when I'm proofreading the emails I write for the college in Bogeek newsletter subscribers because if I'm sending out an email to 17,000 people I don't want to make a mistake and it's pretty easy for me to put typos tip number six has to do with your essays And it is two no matter how easy the essay seems at first Create an outline for that essay before you start writing yes, it's good for organization But the big thing it helps with is staying on topic a lot of students immediately take the prompt and then start writing from scratch In this stream of consciousness style writing often ends up with their essay going into territory that the professor didn't want them to write about Now while I'm all for freedom of expression and creativity in your writing If you're not really staying on topic with the essay, you're not gonna get a good grade So make sure you're staying on topic and use an outline tip number seven seriously cut down on your test anxiety tip number eight Is to check your spelling and grammar on essay style exams. We kind of really put that on my list that is way too obvious Anyway moving on tip number nine is to do a sanity check after you get your answers on math problems Before you go through the actual work of solving a problem, you probably have a general ballpark idea in your head What the answer should be so when you actually get that answer compared to that ballpark number if it's way up the mark It doesn't mean your answer is necessarily wrong, but you should probably double check your work just to make sure And finally tip number ten is to simply know your own brain Do you have specific mistakes that you tend to make a lot? Maybe you get the order of operations wrong or maybe you tend to multiply things together that should be added Whatever they are, do you best to notice them when they happen and then when you're taking your next test to pay special attention on those areas. So now that we've gone through those 10 tips and you've got some ways to combat making stupid mistakes in your next exam Here's a big related question if you've already written down an answer or now you have the compulsion to change it Should you actually change it?
