## Transcript
 This is one of those things I tell you never to say during a job interview when they ask you what your greatest weakness is because it's like a humble brag But I struggle with perfectionism like where other people are willing to just say things are good enough Or they quite rightly realize that little tiny details in their work are never going to be noticed by anybody else I'm the guy that's like tweaking the position of the light behind that toy ship So it makes the perfect silhouette But over the past few years I've learned to deal with my perfectionism and at this point it doesn't really hinder me that much anymore So what I want to do with this video is share some of what I've learned for dealing with perfectionism because as the writer and the Mott very pointy says in her book bird by bird perfectionism is the voice of the oppressor the enemy of the people now Before we move on, I do want to say that perfectionism isn't all bad In fact many psychologists will separate perfectionism into two different categories Adaptive and maladaptive adaptive perfectionists are motivated by their high standards They pursue their goals without compromising their self-esteem They're not hyper critical of their work or themselves and they invest massive amounts of time and energy into projects that require a lot of attention and focus and Effort maladaptive perfectionists on the other hand feel constant pressure to meet in unrealistic standard They procrastinate because things are so hard to get into They feel a lot of anxiety and sometimes even depression because they're holding themselves to an ideal They can't possibly reach now. I don't believe that these are two binary states There's certainly a spectrum between perfectionism the adaptive maladaptive sorts and For you perfectionism probably has some benefits, but it probably also brings along some problems And personally the main problems I see with perfectionism are at number one It makes tasks seem monumental because you want to do perfectly on them So you procrastinate number two constant tweaking and editing will cause you to never actually publish and put things out there and move on Because you're always second guessing your previous decisions Number three your skill development is hampered because you aren't allowing yourself to make mistakes Which are absolutely critical to the learning process and lastly, you have a lot of anxiety and stress Because you're holding yourself to an unrealistic ideal and you're constantly worried about your work being judged So how do you overcome perfectionism? Well, number one, you need to realize that you're not perfect and Negers anybody else and I realize the second half of that statement can be really hard to acknowledge sometimes Because the internet is always presenting us with things that are finished and polished Like we have so many connections to so many people and they're all presenting a tailored version of themselves to you They're so proud to show off the fruits of their labors, but they never show off the hours that went into it And they never show off the mistakes and the failures that they had along the way and these are vital parts of the learning process You can't have success without these mistakes So embrace in perfection embrace mistakes realize it's gonna happen like think back to when you were kid And you were learning to write a bike you probably fell off a ton of times You probably still have scars and your shoulders that remind you of those times and you weren't worried at all about writing the bike perfectly the first time You just wanted to write the bike you probably wanted to get the training wheels off and you tried and tried and tried until you did it If it took so many tries to learn to do something as simple as writing a bike Why do you think you have to be able to write a paper or give a speech perfectly on the first try? Number two, just get started and let you work become a mess Work in private and don't worry about the state of the project on the first pass through and it's memoir on writing Stephen King advises to write with the door closed and rewrite with the door open Don't worry about the state of your project during its first stage Just get it created and it's rough initial form and then invite feedback and constructive criticism Once you're ready to start shaping the prototype into something that's truly worthy of being finished Number three, work with a deadline Now this is the practice that's helped me overcome my perfectionism the most when I first started my YouTube channel I had a lot of other influences and creators that I like to watch and because of that I had this excellent taste right but I realized that I was a beginner and if I wanted to meet that ideal standard with my videos I would never be able to do that and I would never put anything out there So instead I told myself I'm gonna put out a video every single week and I remember after I released my first video I was having a conversation with my friend Matt and I told him a year from now I want to have at least 50 videos out In putting those videos out every single week as imperfect as they may be has helped me progress a lot Now I realize that some people will say that creating deadlines and forcing yourself to put things out there and an arbitrary time Is it necessary and indeed you need time to meander through project and try things and work at your own pace And if that works for you if you believe that that's fine But remember that there are differences between adaptive and maladaptive perfectionism If your perfectionism is causing you anxiety and stress, then I think it's a really good idea to create that deadline and force yourself to finish You need to structure that forces you not to focus on the minutia of one project for too long Number four focus on getting just a little bit better each time if you improve one percent each time you make something Then over time that progress compounds and before you know it you've mastered whatever it is you're learning Creating things putting them out there and having the imperfections and mistakes pointed out these are all parts of the learning process that have to happen Skill and knowledge come through countless iterations not through executing perfectly on the first iteration the skill that you gained Through making the first nine things will allow you to hone the tenth one to agree You didn't even know it was possible when you were making the first one and lastly let your influences inspire you But don't measure yourself up against them a beginner shouldn't measure their work against out of a masters If you were to start a YouTube channel tomorrow and you put it your first video you shouldn't compare it against somebody else's 500 video that's not a fair comparison the only thing you should measure your work against is Your previous work and when you're looking at things other people have made you can let them inspire you You can let them influence you and motivate you to improve But don't hold your work up against theirs and judge yourself based on that standard So this is where I'm gonna end this video and to be honest I feel that it's imperfect. There's a lot more. I'd like to say on this topic There's more research that came across and my brain keeps throwing up things people are gonna bring up at the comments counter arguments other points And I want to cover them all but like I said earlier There's a deadline and I just have to finish this and put it out there. Is it perfect? No But I do think it's useful and that is enough Plus as a friend of mine is a professional speaker once told me the audience never knows what you didn't say Hopefully what I did say was helpful to you in some way.
