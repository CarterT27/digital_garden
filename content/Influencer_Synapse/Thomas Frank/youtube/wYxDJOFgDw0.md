# Study With Me - A 25-Minute Pomodoro Session
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYxDJOFgDw0
Need to get some studying done? Let's do it together. 

This video is a timer for using the Pomodoro Technique. To use it:

1. Pick a single task.
2. Play the video (or use a Pomodoro app if you like).
3. Focus on nothing but that task for the 25 minutes.
4. Once the timer goes off, take a 5-minute break.
5. Repeat.

If you have headphones, pair this video with one of these:

- RainyMood (ambient rain noise) - http://rainymood.com/
- Coffitivity (coffee shop ambience) - https://coffitivity.com/
- The Ultimate Study Music Playlist - https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLx65qkgCWNJIs3FPaj8JZhduXSpQ_ZfvL
- Brain.fm (music designed for studying) - https://www.brain.fm

If you block YouTube when you're working but still want to use this, you can bookmark the embedded version: https://collegeinfogeek.com/work/

Prefer a coffee shop? Study with my friend Matt (who gave me the idea for this video): https://www.moneylab.co/work/
