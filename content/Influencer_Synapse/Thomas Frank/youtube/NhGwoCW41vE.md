 This video is sponsored by Brilliant and the first 200 people to use link in the description down below to sign up We're gonna get 20% off their annual premium subscription. I had an intro joke planned, but I don't need it anymore So welcome to the last video of the year Now I got to say 2019 was a year in which I was very inspired to Improve my craft in many different areas. I got into music. I upgraded my camera set up my studio and That was in no small part due to inspiration. I received from Other YouTubers that I follow in in some cases know in person. So what I'm gonna do with this video is Round the year off by sharing 10 of the YouTubers who really inspired me and pushed me to grow in many areas this year And I would highly recommend checking out each and every single one of these people and I'll have the link All in description down below So the first person on my list is somebody who I would be very surprised if you haven't seen on YouTube before It is my very good friend Matt Diavella. I believe Matt and I met in 2018 when I went on his podcast Talk about general productivity, but this year I flew back out to L.A. and I did an interview with him It was all about his production process and in general how he stays productive and after I created that video I got really inspired to improve my own production process and make some improvements in the gear that I was using It was kind of using a lot of the same gear that I'd been using for several years kind of using static shots Not really pushing myself in terms of filmmaking and I got to say Matt more than anybody else Inspired me in both the way that he makes his own content, but also through talking to me about how he does it to Improve my own process as well now I'm kind of cheating with the second person on my list because they aren't really a full-fledged YouTuber. They're actually a full-time musician, but I got to give a shout out to Tosh Sultana If you haven't heard Tosh Sultana, they are a Live-looping artist from Australia who really kind of blew up last year and blew up even more this year and My head writer ran some actually introduced me to them in June and literally everything that I did this year with music Which if you look at my Instagram is quite a lot in comparison to previous years was really inspired by Tosh when I learned about live looping when I learned that I could mix multiple instruments together in a live setting But also when I just got inspiration from the way they use multiple instruments and a looper pedal to create just these amazing songs It really got me back into music and it made me take it a lot more serious All right, number three on the list is line a Sebastian and in fact the entire team over at Linus media group and I'm gonna tease something that I haven't talked about yet before But earlier this year my editor Tony and I flew up to Vancouver and spent an entire day with Linus He was kind of up to lettuce kind of coming to the studio See exactly how they make all their videos and that video is coming in January of next year So I'm really excited to share all that with you guys But just like with Matt going and spending a day with the Linus media group team seeing how they do things in a very Detailed way inspired us to make big improvements in our own Process so one tip that I would give you is if you want to improve your own process and whatever kind of work you're doing Go and watch how other people that you look up to do it because you are undoubtedly going to learn Techniques and workflow hacks that you hadn't thought up before and they're probably going to improve your own process Number four on my list is a guy named Rebidium who runs a channel called the crimson engine and this is a bit of a smaller channel But I think more than any other channel I started watching this year the crimson engine has helped me to up my game in terms of production quality now Matt and Linus really really inspired me But the crimson engine goes through cinematic lighting setups in detail goes through You know different camera settings that you can use how to properly expose how to shoot in raw How to light a scene dramatically how to use things like you know Reflectors like this or where to place the mic and what I love about Rebidium is he's an actual film maker He's made feature films in the past and his channel is all about sharing the very very deep Technical insights and information that he's gained from doing those bigger budget projects Number five my list is quite a different channel than the other ones I've mentioned so far because it's actually a sketch comedy channel It's called a Caleb city and I would be surprised if you haven't seen this channel as well But what really inspired me about Caleb city was the fact that with very few exceptions Caleb does almost everything on his own it's just one guy doing all the acting all the filming He plays multiple characters and in an earlier video that I made this month I talked about how one of the biggest lessons I sort of learned or really relearned this year was that limitations Are a very beneficial thing to creativity when you have very little to work with when you have a lot of constraints Some great stuff can come out of it because you really have to focus in a hone your attention on what you have to work with and to me Caleb city is one of the best examples of this principle again He's just one guy making videos and with very few exceptions He doesn't have anybody holding the camera He doesn't have anybody really helping him do these things at all and yet his videos are so entertaining and I almost never find myself clicking out of one before I've completely finished it So go check his channel out and if you're looking for some creative inspiration I think you're going to get it there Number six on my list and I think I'm holding it the right number of fingers. Yep It's one of the best music educators in my opinion on the entire YouTube website and that is Andrew Wong Now I have been watching Andrew's content for more than a year But this year again, I really started to take music a lot more seriously than I had in the past So I started watching a lot more of Andrew's content and what inspires me about Andrew is just how Passionate he is about exploring all aspects of music He's in descent the sizeers. He's into music production. He's into playing multiple instruments And he loves to share all of what he learns with the world and he's also just incredibly prolific I mean he releases videos on a pretty consistent schedule But in addition to that if you go over to a Spotify you're going to see that he is created dozens If not hundreds of songs in just the five years that he's been on Spotify So in addition to his creativity and addition to his curiosity and Drew's work ethic and his productivity as a musician As a full-time creative really inspires me to up my own game as well Number seven on the list is Cory Arnold over at 12th tone, which is yet another music channel And in this case the channel is kind of all about music theory and music analysis But there is one video in particular that really really helped me out this year and got me inspired Which was his video on how to write lyrics and it's kind of funny because if I'm not incorrect I remember Cory telling me or saying somewhere on the internet that that video wasn't something he had planned on making He had this really ambitious video planned and he wasn't able to get a done when the deadline came So instead he just made this lyric video and I guess he's not a huge lyric system self So he had said that the video wasn't one of his favorites, but personally that video of his has helped me out more than any other Because I had a project this year which I'm going to be talking about in the near future where I went and wrote a song and I really had very little experience writing lyrics So I didn't know how to do it and I certainly didn't know how to do it Competently and Cory's video gave me sort of the push that I needed to sit down and write some lyrics that I was kind of proud of And I also have to recommend Nari Sol's channel So Nari Sol if you haven't heard of her She is a classical pianist who is incredibly talented if you've ever seen one of her videos She actually performs some of the music she's written. It's it's kind of mind-blowing to be honest But this year I started to play piano again started taking music a bit more seriously So Nari Sol's channel was one that I started watching because of that and she's really inspiring to me for a couple of different reasons First she has this video that kind of goes through a realistic practice session of a professional pianist and I really liked that video But just like with Andrew Wong, I was really inspired by Nari's curiosity and willingness to branch out into different genres of music And to learn from different artists and performers She has this entire series on her channel where she does like you know flamenco Dissected by a classical musician or synthesizers dissected by a classical musician All these videos are absolutely fantastic and I do want to shout out the synthesizer one in particular Because it is the video that inspired me to learn how synthesis works Which was always kind of something that I just thought was magic and I never really understood Kind of how you build the kind of tones you want but once I watched her video and then went down a rabbit hole Watching some other videos. I got it and I found the real is like, oh, it's it's just oscillators and you're just kind of like Adjusting the voltage that's applied to an oscillator or you're adjusting filters and huh like that's the foundation of all Like atmospheric pads and all kinds of different sounds you hear and lots of songs you've heard your entire life So I definitely want to give a shout out to her channel and just her general curiosity and Tenancy to explore different areas of music because it is definitely benefited me and that brings us to channel number nine Which I'm actually going to let my friend Martin tell you about this year I picked up a new skill which is pixel art I've been interested in pixel art for a long time since I was a kid, but I never really took it seriously And this year I finally decided that I wanted to start taking it seriously But I ran into some problem points and I found pixel pizza YouTube channel to be particularly helpful there Especially a video called Pixel art 101 color palettes because I had never really thought about how you could take different colors and make them feel like they belong together Check out my sound cloud You don't have sound cloud anymore, and you really did I did delete it I don't have a sound cloud Okay, and that brings us to the final channel on my list which is going to be Christopher Rhodes over at YC imaging so 2019 was definitely the year of the camera for me Like I said Matt was kind of the main guy who inspired me to upgrade my camera setup upgrade my lighting game all kinds of stuff like that But because I also really got more serious about music this year I kind of naturally gravitated towards getting interested in how music videos were made for me Making a YouTube video where I sit down and talk to the camera. I totally get that But watching music videos especially really well made ones I've always kind of been like that's a whole different level of filmmaking I don't really know how that's done at all and what I love about Christopher's channel is that he is a professional Music video producer and he kind of breaks down the lighting setups that he uses the camera settings all kinds of stuff like that But what separates Christopher from a lot of other YouTubers is that he actually posts finished work on his channel So in addition to videos where he's teaching you how to do things he will post finished and polished music videos And it's great to see little clips to these music videos that he uses as examples during his educational content It's great to see these being made and then get to go see the final product because your brain sort of makes it Connection you're seeing how things were made you're seeing the final product and you kind of go oh That's how we did that and that is what you can do with these techniques if you apply them Properly now if there's a common thread to be found between all the YouTubers on my list I would say that for most them they taught me new technical skills that I was able to use and able to really Combine together to improve the overall level of quality and creativity in my content And that's really what inspires me learning new skills from various areas and then combining them And this is really the foundation of becoming a creative and competent problem solver you want to number one Practice solving tough problems, but number two build a wide base of knowledge that you can draw from and a great resource For helping you do both these things is Brilliant brilliant is learning platform that helps you to build mastery in a math Science and computer science through an incredibly active hands-on library of courses that throws you into Storytelling problems code writing challenges all kinds of interactive problems that really get your brain working Actively to learn the material instead of just kind of sitting back and passively intake me It which really isn't all that efficient now brilliant library has more than 60 in depth courses Including a complete suite of math courses ranging from the basics of number theory going to algebra Geometry trigonometry and shooting all the way up to the very complex advanced math topics like calculus and differential equations and high level statistics They have science courses including waves and light gravitational physics and computer science courses Including a brand new course on how search engines work.
