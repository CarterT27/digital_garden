# Failure and Silver Linings - Accelerated Japanese Challenge Day 10
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SyaRdF2rXE
Greetings from Iwakuni, Japan! This is the LAST video update for my Japanese learning challenge, and also the last video I'll be making during this vacation.

Just a heads up - next week these will be no video. Since I'll be getting home Wednesday, I won't have time to make a quality video on Thursday - but I'll have a good one coming the next week :)

If you don't know what the heck this video is about... in short, it's my way of being able to go on vacation without letting the channel die for a month :)

Here's the overview video I did about the challenge: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjU8ukIOAdA

## Transcript
 Hello friends, and welcome to my final Accelerated Japanese Learning Challenge review video. We're in a small town, a small ish called Iba Kunini or Hiroshima. And I just wanted to briefly talk about the expectations I set for the challenge. And I guess the failure as I call it in quotes. Specifically, I kind of challenged myself to make this like an epic challenge. And I really wanted to put about 20 to 30 hours of study into Japanese before we got to Japan. Now, going off the toggle, which is the time tracking app I use, I only put it about seven hours actually. And this is a result of the amount of things I had to do in the underestimations I made. I'm planning things, so I only got less than a third of the actual studying that I wanted to do done. But on the bright side, I actually studied Japanese. And I actually was able to relearn a lot of what I'd forgotten. And actually going through this trip, we've been here for 10 days now, right? I think I've been able to speak more Japanese and understand more Japanese than I ever had before. So I guess the result in my mind at this challenge is that even though I'd bailed my own expectations, the act of setting a big challenge for myself actually spurred me to take action that I wasn't taking before. And when I get back from Japan, I'm planning on continuing my studies and actually hiring a tutor every single week. So if you want to do something and you find yourself not doing it, making try setting a big challenge. If you fail, then you might find that the progress you do make is enough to make it done in your goals. Oh, and one last thing, there will be no video next week, as I will be massively jet lag, and you'd basically probably get a video of me sleeping. So take a breather as I'm going to do, and the next week we'll be back to regular these scheduled videos about studying and productivity and all that cool stuff. So, see you till then. Thank you.
