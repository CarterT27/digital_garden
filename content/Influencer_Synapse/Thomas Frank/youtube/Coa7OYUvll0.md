# Cold Turkey Writer: A Distraction-Free App That Forces You to Write
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Coa7OYUvll0
If you get distracted when you're writing, join the club. It's one of the biggest struggles I deal with in my work.

However, I recently discovered an app that can help put an end to those distractions. It's called Cold Turkey Writer, and it completely locks down your computer until you write the number of words that you specify.

I'll be using this for pretty much all of my rough drafts from now on. It's cross-platform (Mac OS and Windows), and the best part is... it's free!
