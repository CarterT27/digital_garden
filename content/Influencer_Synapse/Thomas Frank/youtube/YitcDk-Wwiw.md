 Studying is boring, right? Every time you have to open up a textbook or tackle a homework assignment, a million things go through your mind It would be more fun to do like skydiving or watching paint dry or typing a YouTube comment about how the fact that I'm holding a fidget spinner right now It makes you want a puke. Yeah, I can see you warming up your fingers, Derek. Of course studying is something that you just sometimes Have to do which leads the obvious question if you have to do it is there at least a way to make it more fun or at least less boring Well, that's what I want to talk about today I'm going to get this out here right at front. There is no way to make studying always fun after all part of the learning process It's to have to sometimes go through challenging and difficult material and that's not always going to be a walk in the park But there are things you can do to make studying more fun more the time and that's what I want to talk about in this video So let's dive right in First and foremost if you want to make studying fun you need to get interested in your topic All the way back in 1913 Francis Lockwood wrote in his book the freshman in his college in the long run The secret of study resides in our ability to bathe our thought our task our lesson in the stream of interest But how exactly do you gain that interest? Well, certainly don't do it by jumping straight into the minute details to gain interest that's truly strong enough to power you through the hours of rigorous study You need to expose yourself to the truly exciting facets of the topic first Nobody reads the history of middle-earth before reading the Lord of the Rings or at least watching the movies first And nobody goes digging through sea sharp documentation unless they're interested in building something in sea sharp like a video game That's why Bill and I made Bill and I the science guy why Carl Sagan made Cosmos and my David Attenborough helped to make planet earth These three men are known first and foremost as science popularizers because they knew what it took to get the public Interested in science They knew that showing electricity in action or showing a sharp hunting its prey is far better at generating that needed initial spark of interest Then talking immediately about Olm's law or talking about how the dorsal finifex fluid dynamics and the best teachers in the world Understand this and lately they know that they need to get their students initially excited about the topic before they jump right into the rigorous my new details But if your teachers not good at that you can do that yourself One great way to do this is to find a book or a movie or a podcast or even a video game that can give you an initial high level introduction to the topic in an entertaining way Or that's somehow connected to it. I'll use my girlfriend Anna as an example Anna is somebody who really doesn't like to read a whole lot of nonfiction But last year we took a trip to St. Louis to go to city museum and on the way we listened to a podcast called hardcore history And if you have a listen to this podcast before it is one of the downright most entertaining podcasts in the world is my personal favorite podcast And the particular episode we were listening to was talking about ancient Persia after we listened to that episode Anna actually got Interesting the topic and she went and bought the book Persian fire by the historian Tom Holland and this is a good book But as you can see right here, it's a pretty thick history book and it's not Anna's usual fair But despite that she finished the entire book because the podcast gave her that initial spark of interest And I remember while she was reading it she'd come to me several times and say hey I remember when he talked about that in the podcast, so she was building an interest link A second tip that'll help you become more interested in anything you're studying is to adopt a growth mindset Carol Dweck's book mindset the new psychology of success Contrasts people with fixed mindsets people who essentially believe that talent or intelligence is fixed and doesn't change with people who have growth mindsets People that believe anything can be changed and approved upon early on in the book Direct demonstrates how the mindset that you have also plays a huge role in how interested you'll be in your studies Especially when the going gets difficult during her research for the book She followed pre-med students who were taking in initial chemistry course during their freshman year of college and in this course The average exam grade was a C plus it was one of those weed out courses That's basically designed to be difficult, so it weeds out people who are not a good fit for the medicine program Right at the start in the book sure part of that most students started out pretty interested in chemistry Yet over the semester something happened Students with the fixed mindset state only interested when they did well right away Those found it difficult showed a big drop in their interest and enjoyment if it wasn't a testimony to their intelligence They couldn't enjoy it in contrast Students with the growth mindset continued to show the same high level of interest Even when they found the work very challenging challenge and interest went hand-in-hand So try to reframe the way you think about your classes not as tests or evaluations to show everyone how intelligent or Unintelligent you are but as continual learning opportunities opportunities to learn grow and yes Sometimes fail but to come back and approve upon those failures and to win eventually This is a global mindset if you can do this you're gonna find that your studies across any subject You tackle are gonna be more enjoyable and more interesting Another great way to make studying more fun and interesting is to do it with a partner But studying with a partner is a double edged sword that can go wrong really easily And I find that there are two main pitfalls that you fall into when you do this First and foremost if you study with a wrong partner They're going to distract you and you're never gonna get any work done and I've definitely been here During my freshman year, I tried to study with the people in my dorm and all the way ended up doing was opening up Duke Newcome Sandboards and wasting all of our time But just as easily you can find a partner who goes through the work so quickly and does so much of it That you end up glossing over the problems and the concepts and never end up really learning them yourself So if you're gonna do this you need to not only find a partner who is focused and stays on task the whole time But who also ensures that you understand the problem solution and that they understand it as well before both of you move on The next tip is to change your environment in non-destructing ways that make studying more enjoyable And there are a lot of ways you can do this. One of the best ways is to find a study playlist that you enjoy listening to That doesn't distract you and I've been making a playlist here on YouTube called the ultimate study music playlist For a few years that works really well when I need to get some work done It can also help to find a study spot that you really enjoy being in like your favorite spot in the library or a good coffee shop Or maybe study with a cat and having a good drink next to you while you study definitely helps as well Pretty much every single morning. I make a pot of cinnamon clofty which is basically my favorite kind of tea And I drink that while I do some writing And it might sound weird to you, but the ritual of having that potty and being able to pour multiple glasses while I write makes the process of writing more enjoyable So I do it That brings us to our final tip on the list If you want to make studying more fun and more enjoyable than create many rewards that you get for doing that studying See your motivation to commit a task is to find partly by the reward you're going to get for doing it and Was studying there's a pretty obvious main reward you'll get a good grade you'll graduate from college And you won't have to live in a band down by the river, but that doesn't have to be the only reward you give yourself You can also create many rewards that can be an incentive for finishing assignment or even just putting in a amount of time in Now you've probably all seen the gummy bear trick on Facebook and that might work for some people I think I would just eat all the gummy bears and close my book right away But for the most part these rewards should be high density fun letting yourself go out with friends or letting yourself play Overwatch for a while Something that isn't stupid like scrolling through Facebook for five minutes It's also important to plan out the details of these many rewards in advance as the author pure still talks about this book The procrastination equation Rords are a lot more motivating when they're pre-planned because they build anticipation You know in the back of your mind that once you finish studying you're going to get to do something fun And that's going to further increase your motivation to power through that study session This video is made possible in part by Skillshare now early. I talked about how important it is to get Interested in the things you're studying and that's especially important for required classes. You have to take But there are also things that you probably always want it to learn things you already have an interest in like maybe playing a big guitar like I am Or learning digital illustration or maybe just learning how to cook so you don't have to keep living off of hot pockets every day If that's the case then you should definitely give Skillshare a try With over 16,000 courses and a ton different topics There's something for almost everybody and almost all their courses include challenges and projects that you can tackle Start putting what you're learning into action right away I bring me a membership on Skillshare or only about 10 bucks a month, which basically makes it a Netflix subscription That will actually make you smarter, but the first 500 people that click the link in the description below and sign up will get a free Two month trial of unlimited learning and trust me in two months You can learn a lot So if you're interested definitely go give that link a try I want to give a big thanks to Skillshare for sponsoring this video and supporting this channel and thank you so much for watching If you found this video helpful give it a like and if you have additional tips that I didn't mention here Definitely go down in the comments and share them so other students can benefit you can also hit that subscribe button right there to get new videos every single week And if you want a free copy of my book on how to earn better grades click right there Additionally you should definitely go check out this week's podcast episode We're going to discuss the book called essentialism which is one of the best books I've read this year so click right there if you want to check it out or click right there for another video on this channel Thank you so much for watching and I'll see you guys next week
