## Transcript
 Thanks to Hover for sponsoring this video and supporting my channel. I talk a lot about productivity apps in this channel, but for the most part, the apps that I cover tend to be the more well-known ones, notion, to do is. So today I want to flip the script a little bit. Today I'm going to be joined by my friend, Ali Abdullah, who is a doctor, a youtuber, and a productivity expert in his own right, talking about some of the lesser-known productivity apps that both of us use on a daily basis to improve our respective workflows. Here are six productivity apps that you probably haven't heard of before. What's up, Ali? David? I'm doing great. Well, thank you. How are you? Good. Doing well as well. So what I wanted to do today is get people a glimpse into some of the more maybe of skear productivity apps that we use. Maybe like little utility things that just help us get things done a little bit better, go that extra 10%. So I brought three and you brought three as well, right? Absolutely. The first one I want to mention isn't really an app. It's something that's built into every Apple device, so iOS, iPad OS, Mac OS. And it's something that a lot of people don't know about, and that is keyboard replacement. So if you go on your system preferences on your Mac and you hit keyboard, then under this text thing, what you can actually do is create these like little keyboard replacement thingies for whatever you want. So often I'll get a question from people being like, hey, how do you study for exams? And if I type in exclamation mark AR across any of my devices, so iPhone iPad Mac, it will replace it with how to study for exams, evidence-based revision tips and a link to my YouTube video. If I type in exclamation desk setup across any device, it will say my productivity decks set up 2019 or 2020 and the link to the video. Basically any important thing that I find myself typing out more than once, I will turn into one of these keyboard replacement thingies and it will just be synced across all my devices and I think that's completely magical and I think more people should do this. In fact, if I show you my iPhone screen, so on my iPhone, I'm going to go into settings and it's got text replacement and you'll see it's got all of the same ones and it's synced across my Mac and across my iPhone. Okay, so the first step that I'm going to share is that not actually a Windows specific app, it's a Chrome extension. So I don't know about you, but I am absolutely terrible with tabs. I'll just have like a million tabs open and then I go like to shut my computer down at the end of the night, but I want a lot of these tabs, like I want to know if they were at least, so there's a little extension called tap copy and you can just click this little button here and copy the URLs to all of your open tabs and you can choose to have like expanded where we'll have the title and the metadata description. Compact is just the title or just the link. So I'll copy all the tabs and then I can just open up an ocean and I can go to my little dashboard or my note taking system. I'm just going to put it in my little daily task scratch pad here but just boom, every URL that I had open is now here. Wow. So I can finally close down my browser at the end of the night, but not lose anything because I know it's it's been tracked here in have you ever needed to use this to resurface old tabs or is it like a security blanket? Absolutely. I use it all the time. Actually, I'll show you for the course that I'm building. These are all of the links that I have saved from my browser just for like plugins for shopping cards or cloud flare optimizations or all kinds of stuff. Like this is a project that's ongoing so I'll work on it a little bit every day but I don't want to lose this stuff before I'm done using it as long as I have the URLs I'm good to go. All right, next we have an amazing Mac app and this is one of the most powerful things about a Mac which is unfortunately not quite built into the operating system and this is an app called an Alfred. And the cool thing about Alfred is you press command and space and then it brings up this box that essentially lets you type anything. The Windows equivalent is it's sort of like hitting the Windows logo key and on Mac sort of like using Spotlight search but Alfred is just a lot a lot more powerful than the default built-in options. So there's lots of things you can do with Alfred but the simple ones is you can use it to open any kind of app. So let's say I want to open Chrome, I would hit command space bar and I would just type in crop and add hit enter and Chrome will open. My whole philosophy around this and I'm sure you feel the same way is that when it comes to productivity like it's on a macro level it's important to do the right things and then do those things right but then on a very micro level if you can just shave off milliseconds off into any interaction that you have with the computer that is really going to add up over the long term and so normally if I want to open Chrome it would take me at least two seconds to go all the way across my ultra wide monitor and click on it. Yep whereas with Alfred it's sort of done in less than half a second and there's like a lot more you can do with Alfred right like it's not just launching apps you can actually do a Google search or open a website pretty instantly yeah and that's what I like about it compared to just usual max but like max but I let it open apps it's reasonable but let's say I want to search something on Google. I can just type in whatever I want and hit enter and it will just automatically realise that I'm trying to search Google if I want to search Amazon I type in AMA tab and then I can search Amazon for whatever. So it's kind of like my home base for anything I want to do in computer if I want to open a file I press space bar and then I can open any kind of file so if I know what like a title for a video is called I can just type it in and then it'll I can open it in downloads or I can open the file directly or whatever. The other the other really cool thing is that it's got these custom workflows that you can put into Alfred so the one that I use yeah so the one I use is an integration with fantastic hell okay so fantastic hell is my calendar app and you can just type in call so meeting tomorrow to PM in Oxford and it will natural language processing that and automatically say see it's added the location it's added meeting it's added the time that's awesome and so this makes it super easy to input calendar events as soon as like you know I find out about them the other really cool thing about Alfred is the clipboard saving I don't know if you use this I use the crap out of the clipboard series yeah it's so helpful because like how many times have you sort of copied something and then overwritten it by copying something else but this gives you unlimited basically keyboard history yeah it's quite handy so the app that I want to talk about is actually one that is not exclusive to windows it is on both macOS and windows so anybody using it or anybody on any OS can use it that's called loom so I take a lot of screenshots and a lot of screen casts to essentially document what I'm doing but loom lets you quickly record your screen and then instantly gives you a link you can copy and paste to share with somebody so I use the crap out of this because it has a notion integration so we have a knowledge base in our notion workspace and anytime I want to document a process really quickly for somebody on my team I can create a page for it and then I will just do whatever I need to do in a loom recording and once I'm done it immediately copies your out of my clipboard and I can paste it right here into a notion page that's really helpful I should do this a lot more for team documentation because I don't document anything right now and I know it's really bad and every time I do something I think I wish I'd recorded a loom right now but yeah yeah it's pretty helpful all right so the final app I want to talk about is a podcast app which is unfortunately available for iOS only sorry android heathens out there and that is called air a-i-r-r now air is amazing because air is a podcast app that lets you save the best moments from podcasts and they call them air quotes so the idea is that let's say you're listening to an episode of the knowledge project where Derek Sivis is being interviewed so obviously I'm listening to this to ex speed and anytime I come across something where I think oh this is a really interesting sort of insight or an interesting viewpoint I can hit the air quote button and it will save the last 30 seconds of what I just heard and for most of these kind of big podcasts they've got transcripts available for them so it will automatically transcribe and figure out what Derek was saying and therefore I've got a written record of the bits from the podcast that I want to save and so right now I can title it so Derek thoughts on happiness or whatever it was that he's talking about I hit done and now whenever I want I can look at my air quotes and I can see this library of quotes that I've saved from various different podcasts so you can see him a big fan of the Tim Ferrissio and I've got tons and tons of quotes saved from Navarrava Kant another one from Esther Perrell loads from Seth Goden loads from Derek Sivis the other really cool thing about this is that this actually integrates with another app called Readwise which is what I used to help resurface my highlights from Kindle and from InstaPaper Twitter but the really cool thing is that Readwise has an integration with notion where anytime I make any Kindle highlights so I've got 116 of those it will automatically import into this really nice library's thing in notion where I can see all my books so all the highlights they go into the correct book row absolutely so let's see let's preenil sell over Ryan holiday and here are highlights that I made like a few days ago why it's cool reading the book it's really awesome and more relevant to us it also works for podcasts so here is this episode of the Tim Ferrissio would self-goed in and these are all of the times where I pressed the air quote button while listening to this episode and now if I want to revisit this stuff whether I'm making a video or an email news that's or even just to revisit stuff that I found meaningful in the past I can read the transcript and it will give me a timestamp which will take me to the air quote where I can listen okay so for my last one we're going to go a little bit back to a concept you talked about at the beginning of this video which was the whole text snippet replacement on windows there are many apps that can do this but the one that I use is called auto hotkey and essentially you can write out scripts that will let you define keyboard shortcuts do almost anything and I honestly have only just barely scratched the surface so I've got a demo script here and all of these are little scripts that will do specific things so these are some of my keyboard snippets here I've anonymized some of the addresses but if I'm feeling at a form or if I'm maybe talking to somebody in Slack I can just put like HARDR hit space and it will automatically expand to have that address in there or if I'm going through and like one of these is affiliate commissions I have to type this a million times every time I'm doing my bookkeeping in zero so I can just put AC1 space affiliate commissions and that is probably the simplest thing you can do this one's fun so these are some clipboard replacement scripts so like I said earlier with notion if I want to share a link to a notion page if I click this and I copy the link and I want to share it in Slack by default it's going to be this HTTPS version if I click that it opens in my browser where I don't want it I can edit this to have the notion slash slash thing but it's on my clipboard so if I just hit Ctrl Alt V which is the keyboard shortcut I have defined here with these symbols so this means Ctrl this means all N and V then it's automatically that notion version link and it will open up in my desktop app and then the last thing that I've done here is I want a way to very quickly open folders that I use all the time so this is like my main YouTube folder this is the Google Drive folder with all of the thumbnails so I can access it if I'm traveling and these are just opening instantly when I'm hitting a hot key so what I've done is define a series of keyboard shortcuts so this is Ctrl Alt Shift 4 that opens a specific file path but I don't want to hit Ctrl Alt Shift 4 because it's a really weird awkward hand position so I've got a Corsair K95 keyboard and that comes with this Corsair software and I have multiple profiles on here so this one is called every day and I've got actions defined so these are just macros of me hitting this shortcut or this key so Ctrl Shift Alt 7 for example is recorded here and then it's just bound to one of these G keys on the side well thanks for joining me Ollie if people want to find you or should they go thank you very much for having me my YouTube channel will be linked in the video description I'm sure and yeah if you can check out my stuff there thanks for having me it's a real honor absolutely now before we wrap this video up I want to tell you in a couple more resources that you might not know about if you tend to watch Ollie and myself here on YouTube exclusively which are our respective websites both Ollie and I have personal websites where we create content and also let the world know about ourselves and I don't know about a leave personally I view my personal website as my online home base my biggest audience exists here on YouTube yes but at any time YouTube could go away or it could change in a way that I don't like or that's just had been tages to me and with my personal websites that's not really a threat because it's a platform that I control 100 percent I can do whatever I want with it and I can make it the sort of home base for all my online operations and for that reason and for other reasons as well I think it's a great idea to start thinking about building a personal website for yourself if you haven't done so already and of course the first step to getting started along this path is to get yourself a domain name such as mine which is ThomasJ Frank dot com I was born a little bit too late to snack Thomas Frank dot com but I was at least able to get them along with my middle initial but that's the thing about domain names once somebody grabs it if they don't let it expire that's kind of taken and you can't get it which is why you want to get your domain name as quickly as possible even if you're not ready to start building that website get that domain name locked down and go over to hover to do it hover is the best place on the internet to get your hands on a domain name not least of which because they have an extremely streamlined and hassle free checkout process where you can actually buy a domain in less than 30 seconds I have time to myself on this before when I bought Thomas dot LOL and I've also bought Thomas dot blog and all sorts of other interesting ones and that's because hover also has over 400 domain extensions you got your classic dot com dot me which are great for personal website but you've also got dot LOL that limo dot block there's tons to choose from and of course once you have your domain on hover you got a ton of different options for how to use it you can build a professional email address like Thomas at college and bogey.com or use their connect feature to hook it up to website builders or even online store builders so to lock down that domain name view wants and no one else can take it and to save 10% off your first purchase go over to hover dot com slash Thomas Frank and sign up big thanks as always to hover for
