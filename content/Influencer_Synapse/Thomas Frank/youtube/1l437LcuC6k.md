## Transcript
 Hey guys, so this is going to be a pretty quick video, but I have a couple of things that I wanted to talk to you about. One of them being the book that I announced in the last video, which is going to be free and is over getting better grades. So I'll tell you a little bit more about that book and my progress in it in just a couple seconds. But first, I want to just say thank you. Yesterday, we reached 2,500 subscribers on this channel, and my mind is just completely blown. I had no expectations of even hitting 1000 before the year was over. When I started making videos back in August, I was sitting at 90 subscribers, and I figured that it would be maybe like 500 by the end of the year. But we've hit 2500, and the fact that you guys are ambitious enough and interested enough in the content that I'm making and the study tips that I'm researching and making videos about, to watch them and subscribe and share and everything just is insanely motivating for me. And I'm going to keep doing my best to make better and better videos every week. So definitely stick around. If you want to share this channel with your friends or professors or anybody that would be awesome, but seriously, just thank you. I want to let you know I have a ton of gratitude for the support that you've given me so far. So on to the book, and I'm just going to put a picture of it right here, so you can check out more details about it whenever you want to. But the book is called 10 steps, starting awesome grades while studying less. I am currently about 14,000 words into my first draft of the book. And I'm on track to getting it finished and out to you, right as January starts and the spring semester gets underway. So if you want to get that, you can click the annotation that is around this picture of the book over here. And just become part of the college and book it newsletter. You'll get newsletter updates about blog posts and podcasts and new videos every week. And I also send you a copy of that book, the moment it's out. And whenever you sign up, you'll get it immediately. So I'm really excited to share that with you. The book's going to go over how to pay better attention in class, how to take better notes, defeating price procrastination, better study strategies, tackling group projects, writing papers, basically everything that I wished I would have had tips and hacks and strategies for tackling more efficiently in college. I'm writing that in this book. I'm trying to make it short, concise and entertaining. So hopefully you guys like it. And that's all I've got for this video. So once again, thank you so much. We've hit 2500 and I'll probably make another one for 5000. So this is not the only video this week. I will have one out on Thursday. So I don't think I'm copying out on that. But I just wanted to make a quick update and say once again, thank you.
