## Transcript
 Hey friends, welcome back to the channel. This is the annual what is on my iPhone video which is always super super exciting and in fact super excitingly this year I'm actually going to be showing you all of the different apps that I use categorized by the room of the house The location that I use the app since let's start with location number one. Alright, let's talk about apps that I use in the bedroom now The only one that I consider myself allowed to use in the bedroom is audible because often If I'm getting ready for bed. I will have my AirPods in I'll be listening to a book on audible I've just finished the rosy project by Graham Simceon Simceon which is apparently one of Bill Gates's favorite books, and it's about a genetics professor with autism who's trying to find a wife So that was relatable in some ways and at the moment I'm listening to the pillars of the earth series by Ken Follett which is very good Not normally I try to not bring my phone into bed with me But occasionally I do and that is when I end up spending lots of time on clubhouse Then spending a fair bit of time on clubhouse recently you can follow me on there if you like clubhouse if you're not familiar is like audio Sort of like discord and discord audio rooms for different topics and so occasionally I see that some of my friends in America like youtubers in my agency are doing an event Which in America time ends up being midnight in the UK and often then I open clubhouse thinking oh I'll just listen in for a few minutes and then I get like involved and then I get sucked in and then I'm there I'm three o'clock in the morning. Obviously if I do take my phone into bed I inevitably end up wasting time on Instagram often I scroll through Instagram and sometimes If I'm feeling particularly narcissistic or scroll through my own Instagram feed and watch some of my old stuff and of course I also spend large amounts of time scrolling through Twitter and Twitter and Instagram or the baines of my life And that's why I try my very best to not to bring my phone into bed with me Oh and one more app which I don't really use actively but which is passively tracking my sleep is called auto sleep So depending on how I'm feeling Often I will track my sleep using my hour ring and my Apple watch which I'm not wearing at the moment because I've been wearing it for so long That it's caused some like you know dermatitis on my skin or something like that But normally I track my sleep using my Apple watch and auto sleep takes all that data It tells me how well I'm sleeping. I haven't really found the trends to be particularly helpful But I though I thought hey the data's there so I might be able to query it at some point So those were the apps I use in the bedroom. Let's now head over to the bathroom Okay, now we're in the bathroom. Don't judge me for this I know you do the same thing. We all bring our phone into the bathroom and then we end up using lots of apps in the bathroom Now one and being a waste man the ones that I scroll through are Twitter and Instagram which we've talked about already And YouTube studio the bathroom is actually where I respond to most of my YouTube comments So I'll go on YouTube studio. I'll click on the comments thing usually I if I see a comment I just like it because then it helps me keep track of what the comment is and I will try my very best to reply to people's comments Well, I'm on the toilet so that's if I'm being a waste man But one thing I'm trying to do when I'm in the bathroom instead of using Twitter Instagram and YouTube I'm instead trying to use Insta paper now Insta paper is the app that I use to collect all of the articles that I've stumbled across on the internet That I know I want to read later at some point, but if I don't have time to read them there and then Usually when I'm on the computer, I'll save them to Insta paper and then they'll be in a nice little feed on my phone And hopefully what I'm hoping is that When I have free time like when I'm on the toilet I will read through an article that I wanted to save already and the really cool thing about Insta paper is that I can highlight things And thanks to the app called Readwise, which I'll talk more about later It also basically synchronizes to Rome and a notion which are two of my kind of pivotal note taking apps that I'll talk about in a little bit as well Is an interesting one the modern trap of feeling obligated to turn hobbies into hustles So clearly I saved that to Insta paper thinking oh, this is an interesting article I should read that Now let's say what a highlight a bit of it. I'll hit the highlight button and now it's gonna show up in my room research from my daily note And it's pretty magical. So that's what I do when I'm sitting on the toilet Let's now move into the kitchen. All right, so now we come to the kitchen and normally when I'm in the kitchen I make myself a cup of coffee and as the coffee is going I ask Alexa to set me a two minute timer and then in those two minutes Usually I'm checking my calendar to see one of my days looking at so the calendar app I use is called fantastic Cal it's pretty solid been using it for the last like I don't know four or five years at this point A little bit expensive, but it's pretty good and the cool thing about fantastic colors that it like sings with Google calendar and I cloud calendar and all the other calendars And I can subscribe to different calendars It's all the same stuff that any other calendar app does but because I've been using it so long I have basically no reason to switch away from it occasionally one of the kitchen as well I will also browse a little bit of TikTok recently. I've started to become more active on TikTok So you should follow me on TikTok if you want already and it's mostly like the life of bicycle stuff that I post on TikTok You know it like a little bit of a TikTok captions and emojis and trying to keep it short and sweet But sometimes I'm the post experimental content on TikTok as well So this is me trying to do a Harry Potter impression. I have rabbit, perhaps string home Try this water into rum Then again Clearly some of her have come to Hogwarts and position of a relative so formidable that you feel confident enough to not Per attention and again And finally depending on whether I'm trying to hit my goals of getting six pack abs I'm not right now I will occasionally use my fitness pal to track my calories and my macros and that kind of stuff Then if you look for the last year I started off at 73 kilograms this time last year and I'm currently about 79 kilograms So things are not going great on the front of front I get shredded with six pack abs And then usually I grab my coffee from the kitchen and make my way into this armchair Where I sit with my feet up and my blanket usually and when I'm not sitting here playing PlayStation or watching TV I like to treat this as a bit of an alternative work corner as an alternative to my desk And so the main app that I spend a lot of my time in a slack This is how my team and I communicate and it's how we talk about stuff around the YouTube channel And a podcast and brainstorming titles and thumbnail ideas for videos That sort of thing slack is also what we use to host the members only community for the pod time youtuber In a circle which is our membership community for the alumni of the pod time youtuber academy And so we've got a channel for like general gear questions feedback on videos Tiles and thumbnails support tips and tricks that sort of stuff. It's a very nice wholesome community While I'm sitting here on my phone I often use the app drafts to take any notes on anything on this top of mind Generally the app that I use for note taking these days is room research, but Rome is still a little bit temperamentals Often I switch to draft if I have any to write something down in particular If I have a random idea for a new video, which I often have what I'm sitting on coffee in the morning And on my phone then I'll just try to try and write a quick script and draft So this is what my intro to Bitcoin video started off as as a draft script written on my phone And that'll be linked up there somewhere another cool app I've been using recently is called short form Short form is like really good summaries of popular nonfiction books So for example if we read the summary for the war of art This is what we used to create a video which is I think coming out next week around this book the war of art And it's really nice because they give you like a really detailed one page summary But then on top of the one page summary you get a full summary as well And that sort of gives you a chapter by chapter summary of the book and I don't use short form as an alternative for reading books I use it as like an in addition or if I come across a book and I'm not sure I want to read it I'll see if they've got a summary of it on short form and for a lot of them they do and then if I like the short form summary Then I'll actually read the book. So those are the absolute useful. I'm sitting on the on-chair Let's now move on to the sofa where I do my relaxing on my phone sometimes while I'm here on the couch I will just mind this scroll through Instagram Twitter and YouTube Studio and occasionally TikTok But if I'm feeling particularly frisky, I might hang out a little bit on hinge and check out some of my matches This is what my profile looks like for whatever it's worth Do let me know if if there's any ways I can improve it down in the video in the comments below Obviously flexing my minion subscribers plaque as the very first thing on my hinge profile The whole mark of a good relationship is where we spend 90% of our time doing our own thing and 10% of it hanging out so I'm doing stuff together Got my uniform nice picture of me if loving this is wrong I don't want to be right long road trips listening to audiobooks at 2x speed And yeah, that's a profile How many oh 69 match it so far or likes so far because I've got hinge premium So I can see who likes me before they can see that I've liked them so which saves me a lot of time I've also still got subscriptions to Tinder gold and bumble premium I actually have a lifetime membership to bumble premium because it was on sale and I thought you know what why not But hinges where it's had these days so I don't really use any of the others sometimes If I'm in the mood to read a book, I'll use the Kindle app which is surprisingly good If I can't get coming bothered to get my Kindle which is all the way across the flat in my bedroom Then I'll just read on the Kindle app on my phone Just finish reading open the autobiography of Andre Agassie which was absolutely fantastic and I'm now reading a book called How to find fulfilling work Which is published by the School of Life Which is very interesting and date talks about all the different ways in which we find a meaning in our jobs And the quest for meaning and all the ways in which sometimes the jobs can feel meaningless Alternatively if I'm feeling like listening to a podcast and then the app that I use is called Air Audio Which I think is still only on iOS unfortunately the cool thing about air is that while you're listening to a podcast You can hit the air quote button and it will save a quote from the podcast and usually they have transcripts of the most popular podcast Including mine and my brothers and so it like clips the last 30 seconds that you were listening to and so you've got that saved And the really cool thing is that I've got this synchronized with a readwise into my notion and my room setup So I can immediately see the transcripts that I've air quoted from podcasts that I've listened to So for example, you know this Seth go to an episode I heard in October loads and loads of air quotes from me And I can go through the air quotes and I can be like oh, yeah, I can I can revisit the stuff This is all kind of theoretical I have never once actually gone through my air quotes for a podcast and actually done something with them But it makes me feel better to know that they're there and it's not just you know going in one ear and now the other and then I've used to have this real problem. I still have this real problem. We're always forgetting the wisdom that I picked up in podcast and finally While I'm on the sofa. I might occasionally go into light room. I might take a selfie of myself And then go into light room to edit it to upload on to Instagram and so if for example I want to edit a thumbnail that I can do adjustments to it in light room and then I can upload it to Instagram With some fancier effects put in if that's what I mean to next we have one app that I use when I'm on the piano keyboard rather and that is ultimate guitar tabs The cool thing about this app is that you can search for any song in the world and you can find the chords to that song and then you can play the song So these are the songs in my favorite list if we pick can you feel the left tonight Now just tell me the chords for it so I can be like So that's ultimate guitar tabs and you can follow me on Instagram to see more of that singing type stuff if you're into that So that's ultimate guitar tabs, but now as I film this it's around 10pm and I'm feeling a little bit hungry So my housemate Sheen and I are going to go to McDonald's to grab a drive through and the really cool thing Is that I now have the Tesla app on my phone which lets me pre-warm the car so that when we get into it It will be warm so we click on the climate button and I can hit turn on climate and I can heat the Front driver and passenger seat remotely at the moment the interior is two degrees Celsius Which is very cold but because I've turned on climate it's gonna warm up in about five minutes and then we're gonna go into the car Grabbing McDonald's and this is this is pretty cool hashtag flex all right so when the car We're just about to go to McDonald's usually when I'm in the car by myself I like to listen to audio books on audible at double speed or podcasts on air audio at triple speed But because Sheen my housemate is with me. We're not allowed to do that and instead we've got my boy Ed Sheeran playing on the Spotify And then put the phone on the wireless charger so that it'll charge wirelessly while the car is going Now see you in my dolls. Thank you very much. Oh, all right. Yeah, it's in my way Alrighty Yes, I cannot wait for this mackeys. It's gonna be lit Shall we even get home or now? All right, so food is arrived now. We're gonna turn on the old Get cozy And this is how Sheen and I eat on McDonald's together. Isn't it sheen? And finally we come to the desk now. There's actually very few things that I do with my phone on my desk because it's just A hundred times more efficient to use apps on my Mac rather than on my phone and basically every app I use for productivity is Cross-platform so it works on my phone Mac iPad whatever but because this is a what's on my iPhone video The app that I use for all of my note taking is Rome research these days mostly on desktop I very rarely use it on on on on iPhone but it does have a reasonable quick capture way of Taking notes and I'll put a video up there. It shows more about how I use Roman case. You want to check it up So Rome is what I use for personal note taking but the app that we use for team note taking is notion unsurprisingly Notion is how me and my team and my business and almost my life apart from personal note taking There's how we organize everything video schedule book reviews Courses website podcast research for my book. It's all going into various notion pages and notion is what We use for absolutely everything again put a link over there and in the video description to more videos where I talk in depth About exactly how I use notion because I've talked about that at Nauseam on this channel so far The app that I use for private journaling is called a day one and I'm not gonna show you all my journal looks like because I Well, it's you know a private journal Usually I don't use day one on my phone, but again cross-platforms so if I want to type anything into day one I usually just type it on my Mac usually before I go to sleep or in the morning when I'm doing my morning journaling Chuck it's training to day one. I've been using day one since like 2014 or 2015 or something like that So I actually have five years worth of journal entries in day one and yeah, you can see these blue days are the ones where I've actually used it I have kind of periods where I use it quite a lot and periods where I don't use it at all But you know, it's actually quite nice to be able to look back on my life and it gives you these things of You know on this day five years ago. This is what you wrote and I'm like oh dad on this day in 2016 This is what I was thinking that's kind of interesting music wise spot if I've absolutely everything I would love to be an Apple music sort of person but it's just so bad compared to Spotify and Right now I'm playing an instrumental playlist for homework club for my part-time youtuber Academy where Me and like Other people were all filming various videos for our YouTube channels and just doing it together Oh, and in terms of email, I actually use the email app superhuman superhuman is apparently the fastest way to do email I've been using superhuman since like June of 2019 and it's a very solid app have fun no reason to switch It's a bit expensive It basically let's give you the privilege of paying to check your Gmail But I actually really like it and it's It's a it's a pretty solid app so yeah Superhuman across all my devices is how I check my email and finally and after I've actually been using relatively Recently is discord now. I dabbled with having a kind of fan discord server at one point But it just became way too much to manage baby thinking about restarting one if anyone's interested in being a moderator for it I'll have helping me start when I've dropped me an email Me email dresses on the website and in the video description But now I use it like for the last for the last few days. I've been playing call of duty Cold war modern warfare cold war black ops cold war black ops Whatever it's called with some friends. We've been playing like domination mode And so we have a voice channel on discord where I'll sit on and sit on the couch play PlayStation with my AirPods in and I'll be on discord with the boys and the final app I want to talk to you about is actually one that I often use while I'm on the sofa Because it's just so easy to access on my phone But I also use it on the iPad and on desktop if sometimes I feel like it and that is the app brilliant who are very kindly sponsoring this video And Brandon is actually a fantastic app that has courses in all sorts of topics of maths science and computer science Recently I've completed their course on crypto currencies, which was particularly interesting as an introduction to how things like Bitcoin work and like Cryptographic hash functions and all the interesting science behind that and I've recently started doing the programming with Python course Learn one of the most in-demand programming languages the fun way and I've been doubling with the courses on brilliant for around 18 months now And I'm always like genuinely impressed by how engaging and interactive and fun it actually is to go through the thing And so often if I'm in a bit of a slump where I'm like, okay It's like the afternoon and I can't be bothered to get to back get back to work. I'll just do a course on brilliant and just work through some of the exercises And it's often like so engaging that it just gets my brain back into gear so that I can actually do work properly If you're interested in learning how to code by understanding the fundamentals of Python the was most popular programming language Or if you want to join me in checking out any of the other courses in maths science at computer science Then head over to brilliant.org for slash early and the first 200 people to hit that link which is also in the video description We'll get 20% off the annual premium subscription So thank you brilliant for sponsoring this video.
