## Transcript
 Hey guys, welcome back to the channel and to another video in the monthly favorite series where every month I talk about some of the interesting slash cool slash maybe interesting things I've discovered that month, but today we're going to be talking about a physical product, a book, a podcast, and a blog post, and as usual, timestamps for all those are going to be linked in the video description and in a pinned comment. So feel free to skip around if you feel like it, but now let's just get started. The first thing I want to talk about is this Loish term 1917 a five shaped notebook and yeah, it's a physical notebook and I never thought I'd be a final physical notebook, but I found, I've actually really enjoyed writing in it and I've got the the dotted version, I started this on the 24th of May 2019. So in the last kind of five weeks, four and four and a bit weeks, I've filled 80 pages of it already and I found that like if I just have this sitting there kind of with my iPad in front of me or even without my iPad like I went to a coffee shop once just having my my cheeky latte and this book in front of me and just with a little pen and just like free writing, I've actually come up with lots of kind of insights and ideas for new things I can do with my website and new things I can do with this YouTube channel just having like you know pages free pages just right whatever and like draw arrows and do diagrams and stuff. It's just actually been really really helpful and I think partly there is the fact that I feel like a bit more of a badass because I mean everyone uses tech these days, but there's something there's something romantic and nice about getting out your physical notebook, getting out your pen sitting in a coffee shop, sipping your latte like a pretentious type and just kind of writing stuff in your physical notebook. Plus it's also such a delight to write in this thing that it actually encourages me to do more writing. It's quite nice writing with the iPad Pro and an Apple Pencil, but at this point because I've been doing it for like the last two years, it just feels very normal like that is the sort of writing that I am now used to as a default. So when I get my pen out and write in this odd term, 1917 notebook, it feels like a different sort of experience and I think that novelty so far hasn't yet worn out even though it's been five weeks and I hope it won't wear out because it's genuinely nice to write in this. So yeah, I recommend one of these. I'll stick an Amazon affiliate link in the description below if you fancy letting me make 1% commission on the sale price of this. I think I've got this for like 15 pounds or something. It's even a bit expensive for a notebook, but this lodge terms 17 apparently are the ones that Neil Gaiman uses and he knows what he's doing. Secondly I want to talk about a book this book but before I do, I talked about this book in last month's video. Congratulations to the real Jason KO who says an aspiring physician from Canada here. Thanks for the inspiring videos. You're welcome. I would love to receive a copy of the book. Okay, the real Jason Coat. This book is yours. I'll write a little message for you. If you message me on Instagram or send me an email, actually send me an email and like in the subject line, tell me that you're the winner of this book and include your address and I will mail out a copy of this book to you. That said, let's talk about this month's book and that is Shudog by Phil Knight. Now, I never really thought I'd be one for nonfiction. I think I said this last month when I talked about bad blood and how I like incredible it was and how surprised I was that this was like a like an actually good nonfiction, non-self-help, non-businessy kind of book. So I was really surprised by that and then I thought, you know what, I'm going to give other nonfiction books to try. Why don't I read a note of biography and around the same time someone recommended this book Shudog by Phil Knight, Phil Knight, the founder of Nike. And memoir by the creator of Nike, Warren Buffett and apparently said the best book I read last year, Phil is a gifted storyteller and I have to agree with this. This is actually really, really good. It's not, it's not like a standard business book which is full of like advice and stuff. It's just kind of the story of how Nike is the brand started and how this guy fills his love of running, made him and he's like he had a coach who really cared about running shoes and then he thought he could and then Phil thought he could go to Japan and manufacture a certain type of shoe called Tigers and how they made this company called Blue, a pronounce, not blue, a pronounce, not blue, a pronounce, not blue, a pronounce, a Korean language code. But eventually that led to Nike the brand and it's just such a, like firstly like a well written book, like it really makes you want to turn the page, it really kept me hooked and entertained and the way he talks about his story is not at all bragging, it's just, it's a very inspiring memoir of how much hard work and how much kind of grind goes into building something like Nike and there's a lot of interesting kind of insights along the way about the athlete deals that he's done and like the ending of this is actually really good so I won't spoil it but I I was actually properly in tears like I never thought I'd cry at the end of like a non-fiction book but like I was like genuinely crying at the ending and the epilogue is particularly powerful where he talks about what it's like to be rich and I always think that's a very interesting thing to hear people talk about because it's an aspect of the human experience that we all it into to some extent or another like we all want to be rich and so getting an insight into what it's actually like to be rich from one of the world's richest men is very very interesting he also talks about the Nike sweatshop scandal and how that kind of evolved and spread throughout their company like 10 years ago I think this was but it's just overall like really really good oh quick from Bill Gates a refreshingly honest reminder of what the part of business success really looks like it's an amazing tale yeah 100% agree with that it really is an amazing tale I'm always feeling emotional talking about it so I don't actually love this so much and I bought it for a friend and started gifting this to people because it's just really really really good thirdly I want to talk about a podcast that I recently discovered and really enjoyed and that is called deviate by Rolf Pots and Rolf Pots is an author and in 2002 ages ago he wrote a book called Vagabonding which is all about the uncommon guide to long-term world travel and in this book he talks about his journey of traveling the world and kind of shows that actually this dream of world travel is not as ridiculous and not as expensive and not as difficult as people just by default would make it out to be so I read Vagabonding several years ago and I really enjoyed it but at the time I was in university and so this idea of for example like long-term world travel wasn't really on the cards but now now that in about a year's time I'm going to be free from the shackles of full-time employment and then I can kind of do whatever I want I really like the idea of doing like a long-term world travel trip alongside doing some medical stuff in various different countries so anyway in this podcast deviate Rolf Pots the author of this book Vagabonding interviews lots of people and this is a standard kind of podcast where you get long-form conversations but the episodes that I particularly enjoyed are the ones where he's interviewing other people who are really into this travel thing so he did want it to so where he interviewed some guy who travels around the world with absolutely nothing like a pot from like his passport in his pocket and like his wallet he doesn't carry a bag or anything like that he interviewed some woman who travels the world just with one backpack he in his interview lots of like travel journalists travel writers travel photographers and it's it's so inspiring like it really gave me the bug for travel and ever since I started a little starting listening to this I started actually trying to make concrete plans for my hopefully semi long-term world travely thing and listening to this podcast it seems a lot less daunting than it once did to me so if you're into this sort of travely thing then deviate by Rolf Pots would highly recommend it's not just about travel they also go off topic and it's always it's always very interesting especially hearing people who've done these cool things with the lives then talking about you know any any old topic it's it's just going to be interesting so yeah I have listened to it if you haven't heard it already deviate by Rolf Pots finally I want to talk about a blog post and this is a blog post that was written on a blog called Get Rich Slowly bit of a crap name but it's actually one of my favorite personal finance blogs and there's a ton of really really good advice on Get Rich Slowly about how to build your well for bad things like saving things like investing and of breaking these common myths about how investing is so hard and such a big deal and talking about the kind of low cost low effort ways to go about it but the blog post that I want to talk about is called the psychology of passive and it's actually a guest post so it was written by someone else on the blog and the person it was written by that I only found out like right at the end after I read this because I didn't I didn't realise um it's a guy called a remit saithy saithy something like that and remit saithy saithy is quite famous amongst the personal finance community because he wrote a book called I will teach you to be rich which is also a really really really terrible like click baiti spammy sounding title but it's actually a really really really good book kind of like Tim Peres is the four-hour work week it sounds like an absolutely terrible title title but the content in it is is really good anyway so remit saithy this is a guest blog post on Get Rich Slowly back from like 2009 anyway after that all all this background that probably no one really cares about um I'll link in the description below obviously and you read it and the whole blog post is basically about this idea of passive barriers um an idea that I like to refer to as friction you know I mean it's not an original idea but it means lots of people have come up with it basically the idea that often it's not anything particularly big or insurmountable that stops us from achieving our goals or from you know getting good habits or doing the things that we want to do often it's just the passive barriers that are in place so it argues for when it comes to the realm of personal finance it's about reducing these barriers like he talks about a story of some guy who knew who had a check for like $3,000 and just never got around to caching it and a few months later the company who sent in the check went bankrupt so he essentially lost $3,000 and then he asked him okay like why didn't you cast a check he was like oh right um I just didn't have an envelope on me and it's just like such a such a pointless passive barrier that caused him to lose $3,000 equally there's loads of other stories in this blog post and I found myself reflecting on my own life about all the various passive barriers that happen to be there in my own life that stopped me from doing the things that I want to do and I kind of discovered this um when I want to start making these YouTube videos and the process of setting up all this equipment we've got a microphone there a massive light there camera screen like the process of setting this up at the start it took so long that this was like a big passive barrier to me actually you know sitting down and filming a video whereas I realise that if I can streamline this process if I can reduce the friction then it makes it a lot easier and more pleasant for me to sit down and turn out a video and that just has good things in general also you know there's things in for example in atomic habits by James Clear he talks about how if we want to build good habits we should make those habits obvious so for example if you want to floss you know that tea thing then you would stick you a floss in front of the counter on your bathroom rather than inside the cabinet if you want to stop playing playstation so often all you have to do is just put the playstation away and it's covered such that it becomes a barrier a passive barrier it becomes some sort of friction that you have to overcome in order to then take it out again so this blog post psychology of passive barriers kind of breaks this down in a lot better detail than I'm currently doing and it just explores it really nicely and it was probably the main the main blog post that really resonated with me in the month of June when I read it so yeah I'll stop talking I'll link all this stuff in the in the video description you should get this notebook really like it it's good good vibes if you like notebooks Amazon affiliate link in the description below you should get a shoe dog really really really bloody good book also I'm gonna give this away so if you want to if you want the book and you've gotten this far in the video after all my rambling then please comment anything down below and put your Instagram username thing but also yeah like quick thing here can you start your comment with like some kind of emoji because then I'll know that you've actually watched to the end of this video and I will pick comments that have emojis on them because I'm curious like the YouTube retention graph show that only about like 10-15% of people watch to the end of my video so if you want to those people then thank you very much stick an emoji and your Instagram username and what I will message one lucky winner and ask for your address on Instagram and you can get this copy of this book with a little message written in the front from me so yeah that's it for this month's monthly favorite thank you very much for watching if you like the video please give it a thumbs up if you haven't seen my other
