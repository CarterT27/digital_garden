## Transcript
 Want to go guys, welcome back to the vlog. Today is an exciting day because it's the final day of our final written paper of Cambridge Medical School. It's going to be a 125 question long multiple choice paper that's going to take about two and a half hours. And then after that we're going to be free. For the past two days, very kindly, some of the Goatian Medics have given me a lift. So I'm on my way to their place at the moment. But the Emmanuel Medics in my year, we're quite good friends with the Goatian Medics. Hey because we're both awesome. And secondly because quite a lot of us were like together in dissection in first year. You get into clinical school because all the groups and stuff are randomized. It no longer really matters what college you go to and you end up even being friends with everyone. Morning. Like it's very lucky. Well it's been nostalgia really because it kind of makes means that you're nearly end up six years. I mean yesterday was hilarious. So I don't think I don't think today can be anywhere. So I don't think today can be anywhere. Two hours later. I'm glad I'm done. But that was really hard. That was a really, really hard exam. Like was it? It was the effect of mental collitis. It's one of them was. Why don't we? I give one go. No. No. You didn't have all the problems. That's the idea. It's IGG. You can't plan this already. Lander is the best animal in the journey. And he had Amaroid come. You have Amaroid come. All right, exam done. That was really quite hard. We just spent some time engaging in post exams. Discussion as we do. Some people always look at us weird for doing that because like the exam is over. But I think it's quite a good learning experience. And it's always fun. And it's discussing the exam. And realizing how many questions you got wrong. So next off is the local pub for lunch. And then we've got a more celebration plan for the rest of the day. Along the side. It's discussing the exam for me. Hello again. So we are now back in the house. Having had lunch at the pub and then run around town for a bit. Plan now is to do some video editing for a few hours. I've been neglecting that a little bit with the exam and stuff. So yeah, I'm going to make myself a quick coffee. And then get down to do some medical ethics video editing. And I'll see you in a while. All right. So the rest of my college medics have been building for the last three hours. While I've been editing this medical ethics video, which still isn't done. Just got to keep hustling as Gary Vee would say. And now I'm going to meet up with all of them again. We are going to this restaurant buffet place. We're going to come back here to play board games afterwards. This has been a pretty great day. So for our exam was hard. And we've just been kind of chilling ever since. And doing a bit of video editing. What could be better than that? So yeah, time to skateboard. To 9's buffet restaurant. See you there. All right. All right. Last thing is the night. The others are all still at the boating alley. While myself, Catherine Paul, have come back home. And now we're going to be playing three ages. Which is a new board game. We discovered earlier the day. And it's amazing. So thank you very much for watching. If you liked the video, please give it a thumbs up. If you haven't subscribed yet, please consider doing so. Have a lovely night. I'll see you in the next video. Bye.
