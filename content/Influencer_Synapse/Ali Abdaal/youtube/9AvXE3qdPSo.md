## Transcript
 Hey guys, welcome back to the vlog. Today is going to be an interesting day. Hey, cause it's my birthday, but more importantly, today is the day that we're getting our exam results. We're going to find out at some point in softening, whether we're going to be doctors. Why does the color of fibers and spray time? Red the color of blood from my days. Who is the color of when you were leaving? Tell me. Alright, so we just had the morning handover in the obstetric unit. The only behind the handover is that the night team updates the day team as to what happened overnight. There were a few women who were in the middle of labor. A few that weren't progressing through laborers, so they had to give them prosthetic land and fisheries to kind of speed that process up. And then we talked about some of the guinea patients. So there was a lady who I quite clapped in yesterday who was having a few scans and a couple of people going to theater. So it's just kind of getting all the information so that everyone on the team knows what's going on. And it's quite cool here because they use iPads for everything under delivery units. Everything seems all very high tech in the old careers. I've had the round and kind of type in them, so there's not really much paper around, which is awesome. So I'm currently working on putting together a loop or drive, which allows everyone to share the notes and collaborate and building each other's notes. So Paul is actually president of the Medical Education Society. I happen to be vice president of it and Paul is leading this initiative to get everyone to share their notes in an openly accessible Google Drive so that everyone can benefit from them. Yeah. Hope everyone can get on board. Today, our celebrate nurses day international nurses day. We've been having a free tea and a company thanks for the nurses. And all the staff in the hospital, lots of chocolate and we've just been really living all the time. So we've got lots and lots of lovely pictures of nurses who work here now, and they're so worked in the west and all of a go for the last 10 years. It was the color of when you were leaving. Tell me, let me know what you feel inside. Now, it's a really sunny day. We're about to head home, but before we do so, I happen to have the drone with me. So I'm going to be really extra and trying to get some drone shots of Kingsland. Hopefully, here we go. Alright, we're all throughout Dr. Langman and Dr. Seem. Congratulations. How do you feel?

We're just on our way to the clinical school. For a talk by Dr. Barley. We just love him. He's an amazing director. He's got the easy cares about us. He really shows us when we're sad. And he just gets stuff done. He's just an absolute orant sick guy. Definitely an inspiration for the kind of doctor that I want to be like in future. So, he's giving a talk about how he got our ears and like tangers on the way and all that stuff. Just for the record, if any electronic skateboard manufacturers like boosted or one wheel want to sponsor me, I would definitely not say no to that. I was really good talk by Dr. Barley. He was kind of talking about the highs and lows of zone medical career and giving us tips on sort of what he wishes he would have known. What he wishes he would have known. So it's like a specific perfect imperfect. Would have was knowing new. Yeah, have known, have known. I have known. It's going to post perfect conditional type of thing. Thank you. Thank you.
