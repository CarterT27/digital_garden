## Transcript
 Hey friends, welcome back to the book club series where we distill and discuss highlights from some of my favorite books, and today we're talking about your money or your life by Vicky Robbins, which is one of the most important books that completely changed my relationship with money. It's subtitle is nine steps to transforming your relationship with money and achieving financial independence, which sounds a bit like self-helpy, but actually it's a very well put together book that when I read it, read, changed my mindset when it came to work and money and how it kind of fits into my life. Let's start with a passage from the book that really resonated with me. Once upon a time earning a living was the means to an end. The means was earning and the end was living. But over time, our relationship with money, earning it's spending it investing it, owning it, protecting it, worrying about it, has taken over the major part of our lives. Most of us spend more than 40 hours of the weeks total of 168 hours earning money. We must take time to dress for our jobs, commute to our jobs, think about our jobs at work, and when we're at home, decompress from our jobs. We must spend money to maintain our jobs, job costuming, commuting costs, food board, expensively at the workplace, with all that time and money spent on and around our jobs. Is there any wonder that we've come to take our identities from them? When asked, what do you do? We don't say I do plumbing, we say I am a plumber. She goes on to make the point that we're not really making a living from work. Do we come home from our making a living activity with more life? Do we bound through the door, refreshed and energized, ready for a great evening with family and friends? Where's all the life that we supposedly made at work? And she says that for many of us, we're not making a living. Instead, we are making a dying. We are essentially wiling away our life energy on this thing that we call our job in the hope that it's going to bring us meaning and fulfilment and joy and happiness and money. And we say that the things that we value our friends, our family, our local community, and certainly in every study that's been done on happiness, those are the things that lead to a happy, meaningful and fulfilled life. And yet, most of the hours that we spend of our life energy is devoted to our jobs. This is making a dying rather than making a living. So that was point number one. The next major theme in the book is about the question, what is enough? In an environment of more is better enough is like the horizon, always receding. And there's a concept that she talks about that really illustrates this and it's called the fulfilment curve. It shows the relationship between the experience of fulfilment and the amount of money that we spend. At the beginning of our lives, more possessions means more fulfilment as we get our basic needs meant. And as we move from the bare necessities to the niceties, the positive relationship between new things and fulfilment becomes more deeply embedded. We then move beyond niceties to luxuries and throughout these stages, we increasingly come to associate more money with increased levels of fulfilment because that's the way the curve's going. But then one day we hit a fulfilment ceiling where more money and more possessions don't actually give us lasting fulfilment. And beyond that peak of enough, we then started to accumulate more and more clutter than more and more stuff we buy, and then the fulfilment curve starts to go downwards. The more we spend, the more we accumulate, but the less satisfaction we're able to accrue from these possessions. And so with this in mind, what I think about all the time is like where is my concept of enough, like in all the different aspect of life. And in fact, this research from Nobel Prize winning economist Daniel Kahneman about this relationship between money and happiness. And he finds that at a certain point, more money does not lead to more happiness. And that point of enough, in some of the studies, it's around $75,000 a year. And so ultimately, as Robin says, fulfilment is our compass and our rudder for transforming our relationship with money. A thirdly, she talks a lot about how instead of thinking of money as this nebulous concept, we can think of money as our life energy. Like the concept of money is quite hard to define, but what's always going to be true is that money is what we exchange our life energy for. Our life energy is essentially our allotment of time here on earth, the precious hours of life available to us. So every expense that we have everything that we buy is actually equivalent to hours of life energy that we've given up to earn the money to buy the thing. And once we start thinking of money as this proxy for life energy, we can start to calculate the real cost of stuff in terms of life energy. For example, if we're ironing up that new iPad air that costs $800 and we're working in a job that pays us $10 an hour, that would be 80 hours of life energy we're exchanging for this iPad or two weeks of full-time work. And then we can ask ourselves, is that really worth it? On that note, one thing that really is worth the life energy that we exchange for it is investing in ourselves, investing in learning, investing in our skills, and a fantastic way of doing that is by taking online courses over a brilliant who are very kind of sponsoring this video. If you haven't heard, Brilliant is an amazing platform for interactive courses on maths, science and computer science. The courses are all engaging an interactive and fun in a way that really sort of teaches you the the bare bones of the concept and then lets you apply to real-life scenarios. So it's much more interesting than the way that we learn school stuff. One of the newer courses that I've quite liked is about knowledge and uncertainty. And that looks at things like Bayesian networks, causal inference and information theory, but all in a package that's engaging and accessible. If you want to join me in taking the class and investing in yourself then head over to Brilliant.org forward slash Ali and the first 200 people to hit that link will get 20% of the annual premium subscription. Obviously any amount of money that we spend is an exchange of our life energy, but as I said when we're investing in ourselves, that life energy is generally worth it and it certainly is the case for Brilliant. And in fact, one way to justify purchases of anything including Brilliant is by asking ourselves three questions when it comes to the stuff that we're buying. Firstly, did I receive fulfillment and satisfaction and value in proportion to the life energy spent? And this question is good because it forces us to think about how much life energy we're actually spending to acquire the things that we think that we want. Secondly, is this expenditure of life energy in alignment with my values and life purpose? And this encourages us to think about like, is the thing that we're buying actually in line with what we say we want from life and what we morally believe? And thirdly, how might this expenditure change if I didn't have to work for money? And this question is interesting because it forces us to think about like whether we're buying this thing because it relates to our job. For example, if we're buying a fancy suit to where to work to impress our colleagues or a fancy watch that, you know, our colleagues can give it not to. If we didn't have to go to work, would we still have that expense? And I think it really highlights an aspect of life that we don't often think about, which is that in order to maintain our jobs and maintain our standard of living supposedly for our peers, we end up spending a lot more money than we really have to. And so those were just three discussion points from the book. There is so much more to talk about. There's some really interesting stuff in here about jobs and the history of work and how we think about money and leisure and fulfillment and meaning and all that kind of stuff. But if you want to learn about how I've personally applied the principles in here to achieve financial independence and hit the playlist over here, which talks about how I developed very streams of passive income to get to this point of financial independence. Thank you very much for watching. I hope you enjoyed this video and I'll see you in the next one.
