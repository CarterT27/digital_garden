# A day in med school in the Caribbean - St George's University Grenada | Cambridge medic VLOG #37
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn8erxA7DHI
Slightly different episode from the usual today. A little while ago, I spent a few days in Grenada, an island in the Caribbean. On one of the days, I visited St George's University, a medical school in the capital city to experience life as a medical student in Grenada. I had a wonderful time being shown around by an old friend, and got some pretty sweet shots of the beautiful island. Enjoy xx

## Transcript
 Hey guys, welcome back to the vlog. Today is going to make a good day because I have to be in Grenada, which is an island of the Caribbean and there's a private medical school here called St. George's University. So I'm going to be spending the day at the university and living life in the day of the medical student of the Caribbean. Alright, so we're hanging out at the campus. Hi! My name is Sunderst. Do you want me to stay? I don't know, what if you like. And we know each other because Sunderst was a student at Cambridge two years ago. So she's going to be showing us around as we get to classes and things and we'll be filming what life is like as a med student and in Grenada. Alright, so we're having a path of this small group on hematology today. We just discussed like we discussed cases, clinical cases. So we just had an hour, sort of supervision style. It was like eight of us in the room and we were going over a hematology case. So it was sort of like our pre-conical supervision and that very discussion base very kind of back and forth between us and the facilitator. But these guys seem to do a lot of clinical stuff like right off the bat. Like this was a second year class. But in our second year, we would have just done the sciences, whereas they're doing basic sciences, but with a more clinical context. And yeah, the cost was really good. Everyone seemed to know quite a lot of stuff, really broke stuff about like a different types of one-villy brand disease and stuff that I'd never even heard of. But good fun. So this is the sort of view that you get if you're a medical student at St George's University. That's casually walking through the library area and this is the sort of view that you get. It's just not fair, really. Having a cheeky stroll through the grounds. More ridiculous views behind me. That looks like a private yacht sailing in the distance. The universities apparently been around for the last 41 years. I was chatting to some of the faculty guys that they were explaining kind of the founding of St George's University and how it started off as being not very good with any theory just because better and better and now it's become like an international even known center for medical academic excellence. All right, let's do some more exploring of the cliffs, because this is obviously what a standard medical student does when they're at this university. This seems like a pretty ideal place to spend a bit of time. If anyone from St George's University is watching this, then just for the record, I would be very happy for you to sponsor me to come back here again and make another video about your university, also medical applicants, watch this vlog. I hope. And yeah, given that you advertise in lots of places that medical applicants go. Maybe you might like to sponsor a YouTuber to visit your university more often, just putting that out there. All right, so we just had lunch. We got a really good chicken wrap from one of the vendors. Now we're going to find some place to fly the drone from. And then again, maybe around sunset time, apparently the sunset's very pretty. It's a sunset pretty. It is. It's gorgeous. Okay, perfect. This manga loss is really good. Feel like you can tell a lot about a place by the quality of its manga lossy. And this is the gym. All right, drone missions successful, got some pretty cool shots. We were almost hit by warnings for the no-fly zone, because the airport is about two miles away, and a no-fly zone is technically a mile and a half radius from the airport. Now, what have we got next in this? Lectures, fun. Going in. All right, we're walking and walking into the lecture, fostered out the camera. People are probably looking at us weird. There's a lot of, like, international faces around. And we're going to sit near the front, because we're super keen to learn about pain and inflammation. Okay, so we've just had two hours of pharmacology that's just talking about the pharmacology of pain. There are about 700 people in this lecture theater, and they've got a really interesting way of monitoring attendance to use these like clicker devices. And everyone has their own little clicker. And in every lecture there is at least one question, and you have to answer it with your specific clicker, because you're a clicker is linked to your account, and therefore they can tell who's in the lecture. Okay, so the medical students who actually go here, they've got another two hours of lectures, which are going to be about endocrinology, which might have been quite fun, but I thought coming all the way to the Caribbean to sit in an exercise for a solid four hours might not have been the best use of time. So instead, I'm going to sit on this bench, I'll be looking to see have a few bites of a chicken wrap, and do a bit of work. This should be a solid two hours, and then we're going to fly the drone later. All right, so it's six o'clock. We're approaching Golden Hour. The sun is on the verge of setting the light is pretty great in sky, so we're going to switch to the drone, try and get some shots of the sunset for the for the gram, as they say, and yeah, hopefully, hopefully the footage should turn out all right.
