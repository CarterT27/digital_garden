## Transcript
 Hey friends, welcome back to the channel. Today is a very exciting day because my AirPods Pro have just arrived and my original AirPods are probably the third most valuable piece of tech that I own in my life. The first one being my camera that helped me start my YouTube channel and the second being my Kindle that has allowed me to read hundreds of books over the last few years, video on that link in description. But yeah, AirPods are probably third place and so as soon as I heard about the AirPods Pro, I didn't even read anything about them. I literally went on the Apple website added them to my cart. So let's unbox them and we'll try them out and see if they're worth the $250. I suspect they probably will be. Designed by Apple in California, but manufactured in China probably. Whoa. Oh, look at that. So this is what the original thing was and this is the new one. The new one is a little bit bigger. Look at that engraved with my name. I don't know if this is even going to be visible in a light, but hey, immediately this case does feel a little bit more flimsy than the other one. Yeah, they are the AirPods. So this is what they look like on the inside. We've got my little engraving at the front. You'll see it says a little doll, don't know if you notice and then we take them out. And so compared to the originals, we've got the new one here, and we've got the old one there. So new ones are a little bit smaller, but a little bit more bulky. Let's actually try these out. Whoa. The noise canceling on these. The noise canceling is pretty sick. I can completely drowns out like there's definitely a hum in the room. I think from the fridge, putting these in. Oh, wow. Oh, this feels really nice. Oh, man. These might just become any favorite pair of headphones. So like comparing it to these ones. So this one feels a little bit more flimsy. The original AirPods are what always felt a little bit flimsy in my ear, and I was always very pleasantly surprised when they never fell out. But these new ones. There's just so much noise canceling. This is amazing. All right. I'm going to play some tunes. Actually, let's start by playing something unordable because that's what I normally use my AirPods for. Listening to the the great hunt by Robert Jordan. There'll be a link down below if you care to subscribe to audible free trial blah blah blah. Okay, audiobook sounds pretty good, but it's kind of what you'd expect. We don't really expect there to be a huge kind of quality difference in listening to an audiobook. Let's try and play some music now. So let's go on to my Spotify. This is my FY2 playlist, FY2's foundation year two. It's the second year of being a doctor. So I have different playlists for each of my different years of medical school and beyond. Anyway, let's play. Remember the name. I can't decide how I feel about this because immediately when I listen to them, it feels like the noise cancellation is somewhat affecting the music transmission. It feels a little bit more teeny than what I'm used to hearing. Let's compare them to the normal AirPods. Okay, so the audio quality is fairly similar for to my untrained non-ordial file. Love that sounds weird audio file. To my untrained non-ordial file is the audio quality sounds kind of similar to the original AirPods, but actually I think it sounds very slightly more tinny than the original AirPods because of the noise cancellation feature that's introduced in these. In terms of the look and the fit, like this is just the default earbuds. Come to the charging table and it comes with more like different sized buds for your ears, but I think these ones fit my ears pretty well. So this is what it looks like if I show you the side profile by face, which I'm never a fan of because I think my nose looks really big on the side profile, but you know, that's just an aside. This is what they look like. And yeah, they feel very, very compact. They feel very nice. I would be totally comfortable to like place squash maybe. Well, I'd go to the gym with these. But given that this isn't a proper review or do a proper review later, I think given that the main reason I use AirPods is when I'm in the gym or when I'm at an about listening to audiobooks and listening to podcasts, this would be absolutely perfect for that because I'm sure I'll appreciate the noise cancellation. So I'll try these out when I go to the gym and see what how it fares in like a more sort of noise intense environment. But yeah, at the moment, I am very much liking how these sound and how they cancel noise. And I guess yeah, objectively, if you've got the original iPods, then I'm not really sure there's going to be much point in upgrading unless you've really value the noise cancellation or unless you just love these so much. Like I said at the start, these are the third most valuable piece of tech that I own. And the main reason for that is just because they massively reduce the friction to to listening to podcasts and listening to audiobooks on audible link below, not even a sponsored video of lol. There's massively reduced the friction for all those things, which means that even when I'm doing something simple like washing the dishes or hanging the clothes up and putting out the trash, it's so easy to just whack out my AirPods and shove them in my ear and listen to something. And that means that overall I've ended up listening to so many more podcasts and so many more audiobooks, then I would have if I had to get out my proper headphones or even know where they are, because I used them so free so infrequently or if I had to get out like a pair of wide headphones. So yeah, the main value at the AirPods is in the friction reduction and now in the noise reduction of the AirPods Pro. So oh yeah, I don't know, they're pretty cool. I'm going to start sporting these and then people will see that I'm really cool because I've got the AirPods Pro and I suppose that's a big reason why they're people are going to be buying it. Is it worth $250? Okay, so the normal AirPods you can buy for 159 pounds and that I think is totally worth it. Like I would absolutely spend 159 pounds on these AirPods in a heartbeat for the original AirPods, but then is it worth spending an extra $100 for the extra noise cancellation and slightly reduce sound quality in my non-expert opinion maybe that'll change? At the moment, I think probably not unless you're really value that noise cancellation. Maybe if you love listening to your AirPods in the car, hopefully when you're not driving, maybe when you're a passenger and you just don't want to engage with other people in the car, then it might be worth paying the extra $100 for the noise cancellation, but otherwise given that for me the main purpose is audiobooks and podcasts, I'm not sure like objectively like 150 pounds is a lot for a pair of earphones, but I think these are totally worth it and I think 250 is probably a little bit excessive for these AirPods Pro, but hey I guess that's why the AirPods Pro, you know the iPad Pro is excessively expensive the iPhone 11 Pro is excessively expensive compared to the normal version and I quite like this new naming convention that Apple is doing and that the Pro products are clearly the more expensive more legit ones whereas I think back in the day the MacBook Pro was like the default choice for a little laptops, these days that should be the MacBook Air and only Pro's need a MacBook Pro, but anyway, Ramly video done, this was an unboxing and impressions of the AirPods, other things are in the box, this thing, yeah I'll do a proper review about these but I just want to get this out because everyone's doing it, thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next video, bye bye.
