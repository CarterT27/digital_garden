## Transcript
 Hey friends welcome back to the channel. In this video we are doing the long requested long-awaited what is in my bag every day carry tour for 2021. Let's get into it. So first off we have the bag itself. This is the truly VR 24 litre backpack. Links to all the stuff in the video description of course. I've had this bag for the last like three years. They sent it to me in like 2017-2018 some time and I've just I just absolutely love it. I use it every day. It's fantastic. Moving into the bag itself we have the main pocket. Now in the main pocket it's some not very exciting things. So first of all we have my everyday carry laptop of choice. This is the M1 2020 2021 2020 MacBook Pro 13 inches which is fully specced out with the maximum SSD in the maximum RAM. And on top of that we also have the iPad Pro 12.9 inch. This is not quite the brand new one. It is the model from last year. This is pretty solid. I usually carry with it the Apple Pencil. I don't usually carry the magic keyboard with it because well the MacBook Pro is so good that I don't I almost never need to type on my iPad. But it's quite nice having the Apple Pencil in the iPad Pro for 100 and no taking and diagrams and all that fun stuff. Now within here we have this other like little zip pocket and I have a few interesting things in here. So firstly I have this little more fee cable carrying pouch thing which contains three cables USB-C USB-C lightning to USB-C and USB-A to lightning. This is ridiculous expensive. It was like 50 pounds or $60 from the Apple website but it stays in my bag at all times because I know that if I ever need any sort of cable this will come in handy. Inside as well we have three pens. We have the Unable Air Micro. We have the Unable Air which are two of my favorite pens and then I usually just have a pilot ball whatever this one is. Usually in a random color if I need to highlight things. And finally in this pocket we also have a nail cutter nail clipper type thing. I often find that my nail is got a bit long and I only notice it when I'm out of the house and I'm typing and I notice my typing speed slowing down. So then it's always nice to have a nail cutter that I can use to sort my nails out there and then in the the little boys room as they say. So that's it for the main compartment. Let's now move on to the secondary compartment. Now the most interesting one I think is this one at the top which is like a easy access front pocket. Now the coolest thing I've got in here is a brand new addition to the everyday carry and that is the Lyca Q2 camera. This is a ridiculously fancy Lyca camera that I've been using for the last few days to take pictures of everything and it's basically my go-to photography camera. These fancy cameras that I'm using for this sort of stuff they only ever stay in the house as part of the filming studio but this is just such a beautiful camera to take photos with that I've been dabbling with on the ground recently. I could if you're watching this feel if we just want to review video unfortunately I actually had to buy this which is you know first of all problems. Next we have my everyday carry wallet. I never need to actually carry this with me in my pockets because while I've got an Apple watch and Apple Pay and stuff but this is the Bell Roy. Bell Roy something I'll put in the video description. This is where I carry a few cards, my organ donation card, my Tesla keys, my we work co-working space card and recently my covid vaccine passport as well so that's all fun. This days in my bag at all times I almost never need to take it out and we have here a mask. This is from Agamunk and use lots of other Agamunk accessories linked in the video description if you want to check it out. Nice little mask to a you know, space safe. And finally in here I usually carry my keys as well. Again I don't really like these dangling around in my pocket because they're a bit painful but this has the new Apple AirTag with the red leather sleeve holder type thing so that if I ever lose my keys the sound can play and I can find them using fine demand on my iPhone. Next this thing comes off and then we unlock a whole separate compartment for the bag and there are three things in this bag. Firstly we have the Microsoft Surface Headphones 2. Yes, I am not using the Apple AirPods Max, the Surface Headphones 2 are my favorite headphones these days, noise canceling wise, they're better than the QC 700s and the AirPods Max. Sorry Apple, next we have this cool thing. This is the Apple G hype mic. Now this is a really cool portable microphone that plugs in to my MacBook via USB-C and so this means that if I'm out of the house but I need to record a podcast or something I can just plug this in to my laptop and it will give me amazing quality audio. That comes in a nice little carry case. This is quite expensive I think it was about $405 but totally worth it for the fantastic audio quality and not having to lug around XLR cables and all that jazz. Finally this pocket I keep my hoodie. I don't know what material it is but it's quite nice. Blue little hoodie from Lulu Lemon because you know I wanted to be a yoga instructor so I thought I'd get some Lulu Lemon outfits. And this just stays in my bag at all times if I get a bit cold it like packs down quite small. Chuck it into the bag and it matches the bluest that it as well. And finally in the bag there is also a pocket at the bottom of it and this is normally designed for shoes because this is one of those like commuter bags that you can put clothing and shoes in it but at the bottom this is where I have my keep this charger. This is the RAV power 65V so what's USB-C and USB-A charger so I have a USB-C and a lightning cable connected to this so I can always charge my iPad, my MacBook and my iPhone if I need to. In the bag I also have the Logitech MX Master 3 mouse. I almost never use this but if for some reason I need to play World of Warcraft while I'm out of the house then I hook up the mouse to my MacBook and then I can play to my hards content. In here as well we also usually have a kind of deodorant. This is the right god extreme not a huge fan of it. I also have a couple of lip balms. We've got the birch bees, beeswax lip balm and the cocoa butter formula from Polos just to keep the old puckers nice and nice and hydrated. And finally we have the Allure Home by Channel. This is the ADC on Blanche or something which is the perfume that I sometimes use if I need to in a gf while I'm out and about. And finally three other items in my everyday carry. Firstly we have the iPhone 11 Pro Max. No I've not yet upgraded to the iPhone 12 because I couldn't be bothered. I have an 11 is totally fine and it's just such a nightmare like resetting like Google Authenticator and online banking and all that kind of stuff. Next we have the old professional AirPods. These are great. These are with me in my pocket for in my ears basically everywhere I go. And finally we have the Apple Watch Series 6. This is with the blue leather bracelet strap type thing. This is quite nice. I generally wear this one. I'm out and about and it helps me. Actually to be honest mostly the only thing I use the Apple Watch for is Apple Pay because it doesn't really have much of a function beyond that. Occasionally it also reminds me to like stand up and take a breath and because I'm trying to be more mindful that's kind of useful in my life. So that's everything that I carry with me in my bag for 2021. Recently I've been working from WeWork, a co-working space. I'll put a link in the video description if you want to check it out. I think I have like a free trial on it at the moment. Not sponsored. Hashtag, not an ad. Hashtag.
