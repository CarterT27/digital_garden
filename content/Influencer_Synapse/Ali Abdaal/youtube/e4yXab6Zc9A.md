 Hello everyone, my name is Ali and this is my first attempt at vlog. I just got this iPhone back actually It got completely wrecked when we went to this cool place called camp pot for the weekend in Cambodia And ended up renting motorcycles or scooters actually there was scooters not much of bikes driving up a mountain to a national park for It just was like the first time me and my friend were riding motor bikes So we went to this national park and there was this amazing waterfall there. I was leading the way because I was like, you know what, I'm such a dog And turned out that when we go into the waterfall A, I slept on a rock and broke a rib A, bruised a rib, something like that and B I took the fact that I fell in the water resistant to mean that they were waterproof and swam with it and took loads of ice photos But then when I got out of the waterfall It started crashing a bit and then stopped working. So I took it to the apple store in Cambodia Turns out there isn't an apple store in Cambodia So instead I took it to one of those official apple authorised retainers Service people and yeah, I've got it back today and they replaced it completely free of charge No questions asked it's pretty fantastic really anyway So for the past few days, I've kind of had the idea that it would be really cool to start with vlogging I really enjoy watching vlogs on YouTube and I think there's really not many in the UK at least of Medical students Such doctors doing vlogs What I would really want to do is vlog my experiences of being a doctor from beginning to end So starting on August the 1st 2018 and ending whenever whenever the vlog ends But in the meantime what I want to do is vlog maybe my experiences of elective and Experiences of my final year of university at Cambridge They say that when whenever you're starting on YouTube your first 50 videos are gonna be terrible So I'm kind of hoping that over the next year I make my 50 terrible videos and then when we hit August the 1st 2018 when life is a junior doctor starts and then I'd be able to Hit the ground running and then be able to actually film decent vlogs Maybe once a week talking about aspects of being a junior doctor and hopefully people will find it It's fun and interesting. Why am I vlogging? It's not really something I've ever done before. I've made a few videos over the last few weeks While in Cambodia giving tips for the B-match the biomedical admissions test Which is a test that people have to do to get into studying medicine at Oxford and Cambridge and some other Universities. I've been teaching people how to do well in this test the last few years So I thought it makes my videos about it and that turned out to actually make quite fun And around the same time I started getting into Casey Neistar and the other sort of big people in the YouTube vlogging community and it seems like a really nice community. It seems like a really fun thing to do I'm hoping that like very worst case scenario even if no one ends up watching these videos Which is pretty likely It'll probably just be friends and maybe my grandma occasionally Pretty sure my brother will watch each one He's cool like that even if no one else watches these videos at the very least it'll be a fun thing to do Firstly it'll be it'll kind of stretch my creative muscles give me a sort of creative outlet while while going through medical school and while being a doctor and And it'll be really nice to I mean at least I hope it'll be really nice to look back on in a few years time and Be able to see the behind the scenes and and document the process of what it was like to be a medical student What it was like to be a junior doctor. Yeah, so that's what I'm gonna do this and it's it's pretty scary You really do need to have a not giving a toss about what other people think type attitude But I think it'll be quite fun and if you're watching this that it means it's probably on the internet somewhere Which is not what I was planning when I initially pressed the record button and pointed the camera my face But I suppose it goes to start somewhere And the first few two videos are gonna be terrible anyway, so don't watch them, but yeah, I'll see how it goes You
