## Transcript
 Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Lisa Disco-Deswraport. She is 20-12 square feet. We are now today 23-12 square feet. Hey friends, welcome back to the vlog. We are here in Monaco, where they're gearing up for the Monaco Yacht Show, which is happening in about two weeks. We're here for that. The old super expensive, we're not quite there just yet. We're here to interview a chap called Oliver Cookson, who's the founder of my protein. This is a chap who's written a book about entrepreneurship, which is very good. I've just been reading it on the plane one of the live in here. And interviewing him tomorrow, so today we're just roaming around Monaco, getting a feel of the place, marvelling at how ridiculous the expensive some of these yachts are. And it's going to be a productive two or three days here with the team. So we're tuning in to Starbucks, where the Wi-Fi is reliable. We're doing work for a couple of hours before dinner. We're going to have a look at what's going on. We're going to have a look at what's going on. We're going to have a look at what's going on. We're doing work for a couple of hours before dinner. This sort of thing is one of my favorite things to do when I'm on holiday. I'm always hates this because she's like, you're on holiday. Why are you working? When I feel like it's like, well, the nice thing about being able to work from anywhere is that you can also then kind of randomly go to Monaco for a few days. So a ratio for a week and still do the work stuff. The work stuff is fun. And so the way I see it's like, as long as I'm having fun, it doesn't really matter whether I am doing more sports or sightseeing or anything on that top. So right now, I'm sitting on that top. I think I want to be doing. So here we are. Or maybe I'm just bushing myself. And this is just like toxic productivity in the wild, but I genuinely don't think that's the case. At least for now. Oh, okay. I don't know. Should we? To go. Go. Go. Go. I don't know. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. The isolation is never a talashing party. Okay, make that question, you ask every guest on your entreenario. Whoo. Can you give her a welcome? And you can and you'll know it. Yeah. The questions? Is that okay? That's so nice. I mean. Alright. So it's end of day one, but a good day growing around Monica doing lot of work. And going with demand. Now, we're having a semi-o tonight with this 10 30 p.m. We're going to have a solid 10 hours of sleep. And then tomorrow is the big interview day. So thank you for being with us for day one. And good night. We'll see you tomorrow. I'm just a stalker. Alright, day two of the Monica trick, chilling in the hotel again, just grabbing a new cheeky, functional breakfast of the pass-on, and a huge orange, and cafe Ola. Yeah, am I right? We've got the interview with Oliver in about three and a bit hours. So, give me some time to prepare for it. And to do a bunch of other work. And yeah, we've got Amber and Angus and Matt here as well. So, I guess we'll just hang out here in the hotel. We'll do some work for the next few hours. And then we'll do the interview. There's one tip for someone looking for success. One tip. One tip. And this is our biggest appreciation. Well, it is important. It is important. And looking as if we're saying that another isn't fair as a liar, and it is sort of a big coin-ing, but it's so important. Soon you realise that these fearful faults are going to bring absolutely no positive impact to you. They're not going to serve you at all. They're more important than stuff. Right, so we wrapped up the interview with Oliver. He was very nice. Invited us into his home at a chat for like two and a bit hours. That was pretty soon. And now we he recommended us to chill at this Starbucks, which is overlooking the sea. And I guess the views would normally be quite good, but they've got a load of construction there, happening right now for these fancy sea view apartments. So, yeah, just hanging out for a couple of hours, killing time, doing some productive work, until we can go for dinner somewhere. So, it has given us a few recommendations. We're going to try and land a reservation at some fancy restaurants this evening as a final result from the Monaco trip. So, yeah, work time and then dinner time. Let's go. Alright, so we've sneaked in to the free Monaco hotel Monte Carlo, and we're at the Horizon rooftop restaurant, where there's pretty nice view. And we can see a few super super yachts with the view. Alright, so we've sneaked in to the free Monaco hotel Monte Carlo, and we're at the Horizon rooftop restaurant, where there's pretty nice view. And we can see a few super super yachts with people having parties. And, yeah, chilling here for our final decadent meal of the Monaco trip, and having DNCs about life. Well, not yet, but they're going to start soon. And the food is going to be lit, I hope. Yeah. Alright, we've just come out of the casino. We had a little excursion in there. We got some free credits to play some roulette table, I think it was. And Matt wants the money, and then lots of money, and we all ended up losing money in the end. But hey, good times. We've got some free credits to play some roulette table, I think it was. And Matt wants the money, and then lots of money, and we all ended up losing money in the end. But hey, good times. Interesting experience. Never again. We'd recommend visiting, so that's an interesting, interesting place to hang out. Now it's absolutely pouring down with rain. We've got to figure out a way of getting home without getting drenched. So, let's see what we can do. Alright, we made it. I'm just thank you for taking one for the team and getting wet. How did you feel? I feel damp. Soky. Nice. All words we like to hear. Alright, so that's the end of day two of the trip. We've done most of the things tomorrow. We're going to wake up at breakfast. Do some work and fly back to the UK. So night night and see you tomorrow. Alright, it's day three. We've been spending the last three hours at the hotel, just doing some work. And now we are going out about to go on a little thumbnail mission. Try and find a thumbnail for this vlog. We need to take a bunch of photos. Some of which hopefully we can use on the ground as well. And just kind of scatter the area, find a nice, pretty place. And take some hits. Alright, so that's it. We've got some now. This wraps up our three day productive trip to Monaco. Hope you guys enjoyed it. Thank you very much for watching this vlog. Do hit subscribe if you aren't ready and we'll see you hopefully in the next video. Bye.
