## Transcript
 Hey guys, welcome back to the channel. If you're new here, my name is Ali. I'm a junior doctor working in Cambridge and this video is going to be behind the scenes look at the new podcast that I'm starting It'll be linked in the description below at the moment. It's called intercourse and the website is intercourse.fm But I am very thinking about changing the name after feedback from various people who were not fans of the name I'm decided yet. We'll see anyway in this video I'm going to be unboxing all of this new gear that's just arrived from Amazon which should hopefully step up the audio quality and the video quality of the podcast And then once it's all set up, I'm going to be hopefully using one of these fancy new microphones to share my thoughts and reflections about why I'm starting the podcast Firstly, and also a little bit about kind of why I spent so much money on all this gear even though I have just I've never done this podcast thing before And I'll talk a little bit about how I'm learning this whole process of audio production podcasting in general. I quite like documenting the behind the scenes of stuff that I'm doing And I wish it something that people did more often Because generally we get to see the final result. We don't see the first time a podcaster did their first podcast and how they felt about it and stuff And like personally, I really enjoy watching behind the scenes of stuff like whether it's youtubers or podcasters or authors Because I think seeing how they got started is always quite inspirational because it reinforces the idea that Anyone could do this sort of stuff and you don't need anything special to do it You just need a kind of a willingness to learn and adapt and all that stuff So whether or not this podcast goes anywhere I still think it'll be interesting to see the behind the scenes of it and I'd be very released It'll be something good to look back on in a few years time that oh, okay, that was something that I I felt like doing back in the day anyway So let's get this stuff unboxed and set up and then hopefully we can try out the new microphone and then I'll ramble on a little bit more about And my thoughts on this whole podcasty and documentary topic, okay So I'm gonna put this stuff away because the thumbnail is done, and I don't need it anymore for now. Let's start with The audio recorder now this is the zoom h5 which I picked up on the Amazon Prime day sale a few weeks ago Good thing about this is that you can plug in multiple XLR inputs and the way I wanted this podcast to work is that I wanted to have at least two microphones one for each of the guests Plug into a into an audio recorder and then both guests be able to monitor the audio the inspiration for this whole setup is Matt Develops podcast the ground up show the the production value on that is literally the best Production value of any kind of interview format that I've ever seen in my life with the exception of maybe masterclass the masterclass videos I absolutely sick, but that's like multimillion dollar Operation Matt developers podcast is a one-man operation and it just looks so so good and that's kind of where the inspiration for this This setup came from and apparently from watching YouTube videos because I really don't know anything about this audio stuff Apparently the pre-amps in this are quite good So you get you see you can get a good amount of gain my understanding of this whole audio stuff is that when you plug in microphone It's like these into a recorder. You need you need to you need to give them a lot of volume boost if you have a good volume boosty Sort of device like this or you can get external as well, but there's cost more money if you have a good gain Adding device it adds it adds volume to the to the audio without adding background hiss if you just took Audio from this plug into a laptop and then tried to bump with the volume you'd get so much hits in the background It would just be completely unusable next we have two road procasters I spent ages on YouTube looking at reviews and stuff of all these microphones I was considering the short SM70s, which is the one that Matt developers use is the white combination podcast users a lot of Propodcasters use the short microphones, but that was a little bit on the expensive side I thought these road procasters were you know quite pretty and a good sweet spot between price and quality All right, so let's see what this is like Oh, it comes in a little leather pouch thing. That's that that's a good touch Now moving to truth. Here we go. Oh, oh, this feels legit. This feels off this metal This feels like like a premium product. This is nice. I like this. That's it. I'm enjoying this so far All right here is number two Next we've got the road PSA studio arm which is what you attach the microphone to and again I spent ages with new YouTube reviews and scarring into that and this seemed to be a good option It will quite expensive I bought the prices in the in the description below if you're interested But you know investing in quality will talk a little bit more about that at the end of the video Oh Hello, yeah, this feels good. I'm liking this so far All right number two. Let's have a look like next we have the shock mount again Look on the internet these PSM one shock mounts seem the most legit option. So why not? This is cool. And then finally we've got these pop shields And these minimize like the plosive pea sounds so that's everything unboxed Let's now set up one of the microphones and and we'll see if it's any good Hey guys, welcome back to the channel. Okay, so we've got the boom arm the shock mount and the microphone with the pop filter set up I'm already noticing a few issues with water focusing like if I move this into the wrong place The camera will probably focus on on the microphone instead of my face so Need to either start respecting manual focus or work out a way around this I think it should be all right at this angle, but yeah, that's it Let's now plug some XLR pebbles in and see what the audio quality is like So next thing you hear is gonna be audio from from this microphone So there were a few quick things that I wanted to talk about and this is it seems like a good a chance as any Firstly, why did I start this this podcast? Why did I get all this gear? Essentially the main reason is that there are a lot of videos that I wanted to do with friends of mine People that I admire in one way or another and I think they've got a lot of advice A lot of tips that they can share with the audience of this YouTube channel So in the past when I've done collaborations like with ibsmo and with matacus and with path and and and and with other people We've kind of just been using a a standard sort of two people sitting on a sofa format and That's all right, but because I you know I quite like pushing the boundaries of production value and because Got inspiration from mat divela and his his style. I thought that Creating a podcast for the purpose of facilitating interviews between me and my friends I think that that was kind of the main reason for it The podcast at the moment. I'm not planning for it to be a regular thing It'll just be a whenever I've got a friend coming over or if I'm going around a friend's place and we've got something to say Then I'll take the podcast equipment and we'll record the podcast out of it We'll film them and then we'll turn some of that into a YouTube video and some of that and like the whole audio will stick on on the podcast So at the moment, it's quite a low effort thing to maintain. I hope But having said that I still wanted the production value to be quite high hence all of the all of this Hence all of this equipment Secondly, why did I why did I get all of this equipment? This was at least a few hundred pounds I think in the region of five six hundred pounds and this this two schools of thought here The first one is that the gear doesn't really matter the content is far more important Provided you have like a baseline level of audio quality because audio quality is Parmore important the video quality Um, provided you have that baseline level people care much more about the content than they do about the production value Then there's the other school of thought that's like yeah that might be true to an extent but If you can add production value then people do appreciate that and that's what I noticed from Matt Develops podcast as well. He said like really early on um that There are so many podcasts that they're in the world But the one thing that he knew he could make his his own one stand out is by because he was a filmmaker By having just really good production value good audio good video filmed really nicely with good color grading et cetera et cetera And the sorts of people that watch his show are the sorts of people that would appreciate that level of production value So the way I think about it. Yeah, I agree that content is the most important thing and to an extent gear doesn't matter But I kind of view buying gear as investing as sort of as investing in myself So I'm a big fan of personal finance big fan of investing in stuff in general and I keep in the back of my mind What I call the 10% rule. I don't know if I came up with it. It's probably a thing someone else came up with as well The the premise of the 10% rule is that An investment is generally considered good if it yields you 10% a year So for example, if you buy a house and you can rent it out for whatever and Let's say you put in 100,000 into the house back in the day That's no longer really possible especially in the south and the UK Let's say you bought a house for 100,000 pounds traditional teaching on this matter is that if you can get a 10% return on that I eat every year you would make 10% of that value back So you'd every year you'd be making 10,000 pounds in rent that would be considered a really good investment So by the end of 10 years you will have made back your initial investment because you know 10% a year And then beyond that point any additional money you make from that would be pure profit So 10% is kind of like the gold the gold standard in terms of real estate These days in the south of England. It's just it's almost impossible to get a 10% yield on it on anything I've done a few back at the envelope calculations for houses that my family and my friend rent And you know the yield their landlord is getting is sometimes 1% sometimes 2 sometimes 3% So 10% is kind of the ideal 10% is also sort of close to the figure of if you invest in something like the S&P 500 Which is a stock market index that's made up of the top 500 companies in the US On average that returns in the region of 10% a year or has done for the last 30 years Depending on who you ask kind of hovers around 7% 9% depending on what sort of assumptions you make Anyway, so 10% is like if you can get the 10% return by investing in the S&P 500 that's also pretty good The way I view spending money on like investing money and stuff like this is I ask myself the question of Fine, I've spent let's say a thousand pounds on audio equipment Will like do I anticipate getting a 10% return on that I eat in the next 10 years will I make that thousand pounds back And then this thing will continue to hopefully generate revenue and when it comes to stuff like camera equipment or You know upgrading my upgrading my microphones or you know getting a studio monitor or getting some lighting The answer to that is generally yes, like I've definitely spent at least about 5,000 pounds if not more on camera and microphone equipment throughout the last few years And I've actually pretty much made all of that back already in I like after about a year of doing YouTube From like YouTube ad revenue and brand deals and and all this sort of stuff I also have this business on the side that runs courses for medicine applicants six men to code at UK and People have gone to that from my YouTube videos so in a way The like it almost doesn't matter how much money I spend on equipment for YouTube videos and for podcasts and stuff Because all it needs is just to hand foot of people to be in that market of applying to medicine and then see my content and think oh This guy's pretty good. I like his content and then they follow the follow the link in the video description to my courses And then the sign up for one of our courses or our online question bank and then that money kind of comes back to me So In a roundabout way the way I view buying buying all the stuff is that it's an investment and I think it's it's an investment that will have a greater than 10% yield Which is why I don't feel bad at all when I buy fairly expensive camera gear because I kind of know that or I vaguely have this idea that okay I'm pretty sure that in the next 10 years I'll probably make this money back And so far that's turned out to be a bet that's worked every every time maybe the podcast won't go anywhere I'm having very very low expectations about it and that's another thing that I like to I like to do like not really having goals in terms of the numbers not really having expectations in terms of how I think things will work out There's a really good episode of the Tim Ferriss show one of my favorite podcasts where he's interviewing Jason Fried who is a software developer A founded the company base camp And he's talking and Jason talks about how he doesn't like to have goals or doesn't like to have expectations And this is a very stoicism thing as well This is generally good practice according to stoicism and I fully agree with this to not really have many expectations in your life at all So I'm putting a lot of effort into this podcast. I've got the equipment I'm hopefully going to get the production value right But I have pretty much zero expectation in terms of how it'll work out and even if no one downloads it I still think it'll have some value because the main purpose of the podcast in a way is to facilitate Making YouTube videos with my friends and even if no one watches those YouTube videos at least it gives me You know a couple of hours to have a conversation with my friends, which is you know the The sort of conversation that you tend not to have outside of a podcast format Like you know the stuff I'd want to ask my friends is about their morning routines about their favorite quotes about You know methods they use to it for productivity and you know having a structured conversation about that It's just not something that you would do in real life outside of a podcast format so you know Very worst case scenario no one listens to the podcast no one watches the videos But I still get to have these conversations with my friends and over time that is absolutely worth the I don't know 600 pounds of paid for this for this podcast equipment finally the reason I'm documenting sort of the behind the scenes of this is that Having having been doing YouTube for just over a year. I've got a lot of messages from people saying How did you first learn editing or you know have you got any tips for editing and also when I put videos on my Instagram story You can follow me on Instagram When I put videos on my Instagram story of me playing the piano and singing songs I also get a lot of messages of how did you learn to play the piano? How did you learn to sing? I was kind of west that oh like I only learned to play the piano like three years ago and I really wish I Videoed myself and learning how to play because just seeing seeing the progression I at this point if people see my videos of me playing the piano and singing people people will think that oh Just got pretty good at piano and hopefully they'll think he's pretty good at singing but that really wasn't the case and I think I think if I'd videoed myself or if if anyone in that position videos themselves or or makes Any kind of content that shows how they first got started and then they get to a point where people think they're good I think that is a really good way of Inspiring people and be teaching people what they can do to get to that level if that's what they want to do So I'm gonna be working on some videos talking about how my like my method of learning how to play the piano But pretty much just following YouTube videos and doing chords and then singing along with them And I've got some tricks for that, but it's not quite the same as you know if I had the footage from four years ago when I was first learning And one of the people I admire on the internet Gary Vaynerchuk says this a lot He has this idea of document don't create like when you're a content creator and you're in in this whole industry His ideas that you want to be documenting the process of you doing stuff rather than thinking that you have to create content anyway And he makes the point that 10 years ago when he was starting his one library business for the first time It would have been absolutely amazing if he'd kind of made videos talking about his thoughts and feelings at the time Now he's a multimillionaire and charge of a multimillion dollar company But it would have been really cool to see how he got started What his what his thoughts and feelings were as this whole thing sort of happened So I've kind of taken this mantra on board document don't create and I hope that Hey, it's it's it's quite fun for me. I quite like documenting the process. It's fun to look back on I look back on my initial vlogs from elective and I think oh, you know I'm glad I did that but secondly, I hope at some point you know it might be useful slash inspirational slash Whatever for anyone else who's watching this and finally While we're on this kind of just general stream of consciousness There's another principle that I came across in a book. I think it's called show your work By Austin Cleon and I wrote about this on my blog when the when first starting a blog for the first time in January 2016 that was my new years resolution his his thing is Like often a lot of a lot of us and definitely this was the case for me and this is definitely the case for people I've spoken to and talked to by Instagram people asking me questions is that there's this barrier in our heads Like we want to create something like starting a blog or a podcast or a you know a YouTube channel or whatever But we think that no one's gonna care and we think that oh, you know who am I to comment on on you know Starting a podcast I've never started a podcast before who am I to start a YouTube channel What do I have put what do I possibly have to say that anyone would be interested in and he says that in in this book He says that just ask yourself will what I'm making help at least one person in some way or another And in most cases the answer to that is yes Like you know, let's say you're a secondary school student and you're just starting your GCSEs and you make a video about you know How how you how you found arising for physics that might seem like a pretty like standard thing and you're probably gonna be thinking oh No one's gonna care about that But if you ask yourself will this help at least one person then the answer is yes There is gonna be at least one person in the world who will find that video useful and I think that's a good bar to set That's at least why I try to do so this video for example It's it's not really the sort of video. I normally make on this channel, but you know I'm thinking will it help at least one person and I think the answer is yes I think in a way I'm making this video for myself a few months ago I would have liked to see a video like this of someone just starting a podcast app for the first time Showing what set up they're using and then kind of explaining the rationale behind it I think that's an interesting video so will I help at least one person? I certainly hope so and and yeah That's that's pretty much it hopefully the audio quality from this is good if not we'll just revert to the road video my ProPlus and I'll probably switch it around a bit So that we can compare but thank you very much for watching if you like this video please give it a thumbs up if you haven't Subscribe to the YouTube channel please consider doing so and if you want to check out the podcast You can go on into course.fm Bit of a rogue name. I know if you have any ideas for other things like a name the podcast Please let me know in the comments or via Instagram or whatever Thanks so much for watching and I'll see you in the next video. Goodbye
