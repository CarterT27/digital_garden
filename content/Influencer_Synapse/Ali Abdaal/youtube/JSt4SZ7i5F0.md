## Transcript
 Hey guys, welcome back to the channel. If you're new here, my name is Ali. I'm a final year medical student at Cambridge University And it's absolutely lovely to see today We're going to be talking about how to answer the common interview question of what is your biggest weakness? And I know this is a question that feels a lot of people would dread because there's a bit of uncertainty about whether you talk about a weakness and then turn into a strength Or whether you're actually honest about your weaknesses or whether you say you're a perfectionist So hopefully by the end of this video You'll have a better idea about how to answer that question to that end We'll be hearing from six different medical students who are offering their own perspective on how to answer the question And then we'll have a segment of myself and my friend Kenny actually answering the question as if we would in an actual interview So you have an idea of what an answer might look like but the biggest thing to say is kind of like with all of these videos and any kind of book that you read about interview preparation Is that there really isn't a right or wrong answer the right answer just depends on what you think your biggest weakness is You can pretty much say anything and I think a good formula to follow is that pick something that actually is a weakness for you But then talk about how you're improving on it and I think that's probably the formula that most people follow when answering this question and then you just kind of Customize it personalize it make it your answer and hopefully deliver it in a nice way with like smiling and you know Just kind of trying to be engaging with the answer and you'll be absolutely fine This question isn't really something to worry about But it is something you want to be thinking about in advance of the interview so that you're not completely thrown by it If it comes your way now We're gonna hear from six medical students who are offering their own different perspectives about how to answer this question And then we'll be hearing from myself and Kenny doing a mock interview answer for that question So six medical students coming up giving you tips on how to answer the question and I'll see you in just a moment So it's a bit of a mean question don't go too hard on yourself Don't kind of say oh, you know, I'm lazy. I'm terrible with my time But similarly, don't say you're a perfectionist because medicine's not really the career for you if you are and That's a bit cliche. You know, one of the things I've heard people say is that they take on too much They find it hard to say no to opportunity is prioritizing When they've got lots of things on their plate or all things that they could work on So anything that's not too sort of self There's not to sort of self-daming But another good way to follow it up is to say how you're working on it So I'm not good with my time management However, I've taken steps to adjust this and I'm now getting better Prioritizing things that need to be done immediately versus things that could possibly wait just something basic like that So if the watch your biggest weekend weakness question, I think a lot of people will see it as like a trick question And if you like they have to say you know, my biggest weakness is that I'm such a perfectionist or something like that Basically turning a strength into weakness. I didn't do that I was very honest about my biggest weakness which for me is anxiety as Jealous with anxiety and that's something that I am where could impact my practice in future But instead of pretending that I had a strength what I did is actually talk about how I'm going to improve my weakness So I said I have anxiety but I speak to my GP about it regularly I have counselling I it's something that I tell people when I when I enter a stressful situation and Basically the tips and tricks that I was doing myself to improve my weakness So don't feel like you have to sort of sell a strength as a weakness be open and honest about things that you really do Consider weaknesses, but talk about how you're going to make those better and how you're going to change with in yourself to make sure that they don't impact your clinical practice I think it's actually worth actually thinking again, you know, make it about you and what is your biggest weakness? What do you struggle with because everyone does struggle with some things? So for me, I know that my confidence was not very good It's still with something I struggle with now and so that was really true I could say that actually I know that as a doctor one of the things I'm going to have to do is be confident in myself and my abilities to a point And I know that I have to learn where that point is so that I'm not too confident and I'm not under confident because actually both of those are bad for patients Efting so if you can if you can link it to something that is true and realistic for you But also something that you're showing your learning from it You're saying that I know that this is something that needs work and this is how I'm going to change it So people get really worried about this question because they think Oh crap, how do I talk about my weaknesses that's having to weak? How do I sound like I'm not just being myself up by saying I'm a perfectionist or something else Appreciate like that again. I think it's good to be honest, but not too honest So for example, I wouldn't have said that I have poor time keeping which is true very true Because that's not a good quality in a doctor and less I could really justify how I've worked and it really well and improved a lot No, your weakness is such an important part of medicine and all through your career You'll be encouraged to self-reflect every day through portfolios through revalidation So this is a really crucial question not just for interviews, but just for life So I actually just think honestly about it think where your weakness lies and how you would You know go about to improve that so for me in particular I was I was always very much a perfectionist a very kind of like a lot of medics I always kind of and quite thorough with things almost to the point where it impairs the job So I think just being aware of that and saying you'll be aware of that and having strategies to deal with it Okay, so that was six medical students giving tips on how to answer the question. What is your greatest weakness? Now we're going to hear from myself and my friend Kenny who are going to be giving mock interview answers to the camera As if we were in an actual interview. So I obviously knew the question was coming up But the answer I gave on camera is very similar to the answer I would have given back in the day when doing interviews And actually I think I got asked that question like three times out of the foreign to these and I gave pretty much the exact same answer every time Kenny didn't know the question was coming up So he's honestly completely off the cuff, but I still think it's pretty good answer and hopefully you guys might learn something from it And might sort of get an idea of what an answer might look like But equally, it's important to say don't try and copy answers. You should never be copying answers from anywhere The right answer is what's the right answer for you? So this is just to give you an idea of what some people might want to say But please don't think you have to copy this format anyway all that aside Let's now hear from myself and Kenny giving answers to the question and I'll see you in the moment So I'd say my biggest weakness Is probably public speaking so I've had a stutter since I was about age four And that has made it quite difficult for me to do public speaking in the past and also you know everyone everyone's got a fear of public speaking So maybe I'm just using that as an excuse, but I I kind of realized this when when being asked to do presentations in English class, you know even something as simple as a book review Would really get my heart rate of get me sweating and I I kind of thought that If if I if I do want to be a doctor and if I do want to teach because I quite like the idea of teaching then public speaking is something I do have to work on so I have been trying to improve my public speaking skills When I was in year 12 I decided to become a close-up magician So I look if you magic tricks and then volunteer to the local hospice to perform magic for the for the guests for the residents there And I performed with that Christmas party which was really really scary, but it did help me improve my public speaking and Apart from that I've also started working I've also started helping GCC in A-level students with within maths and science and while it's not really public speaking as such It has kind of improved my confidence and help me kind of realize that when when I know what I'm talking about then the confidence Kind of kind of comes across and yeah, it's it's still a working progress You can probably tell from this interview that you know I'm still quite nervous when it comes to when it comes to speaking in front of people, but it is something I'm working on But yeah, I would say that's probably my biggest weakness at this point I think one of my biggest weaknesses can be summarized with the phrase if you want something done well Do it yourself because I think I'm a person that likes to do everything and I like to do everything because some times I think that I might not in an arrogant way But some to that thing I might be able to get it down maybe quicker than someone or maybe to the way that I want it Even though there's multiple ways of doing things in this and there's multiple ways that things might be able to be done so I think the fact that I always want to kind of take on take on a burden or take on almost every role is something that I need to Definitely work on because in a hospital environment Drs have one wrong nose seven up a row help care since I have have enough role, so but everyone Kind of all past all works together and I also need to realize that I have my own limitations just because I want to do everything doesn't mean I'm good at everything that I do So I think it's it's definitely important for me to To learn or to take on board that there are some things that I might be better at than other people There are some things that people can do better than I can do and that's definitely something that I learnt during my time in a committee when I was in school and essentially what this committee was was every other week we had to put put on a Not a not a show, but we had to put on almost like we would be essentially had to fill up an hour of Kind of the year groups time and I was allocating chairman of that committee and when I've given that right Thought okay, it's up to me to tell you these with people to come in and talk to the you group It's up to me to liais with the committee members and finding that it's up to me to liais with teachers and I quickly found out that I can't do all of that by myself and that the reason I'm in a committee is because there's other people who I'm able to delegate tasks to what other people who might be able to do things better than I can so that's definitely a way that I Improved what was my weakness and it's definitely something I think I still need to work on but it's something I'm not afraid to work on all right cool that brings us to the end of the video We've heard from six medical students giving their perspective on how to answer the question What's your greatest weakness we've heard from myself and can it giving mock answers to the interview question as if we were actually in an interview And yeah, I really hope you found that useful I know this question cause a lot of anxiety, but hopefully by now you've realized that it's not too bad and you've had some ideas about what you can say when you're faced with this question In the interview and just to reiterate, the biggest thing is that you make your answer personal to you and that really isn't a right or wrong answer So yeah, I really hope you found that useful if you've got any questions at all about the medicine application or about anything else or if you go any suggestions for videos that we could be doing on the
