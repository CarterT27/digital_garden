## Transcript
 I've been walking home talking long See your shoulders leaving close to you Never touch, you're getting drawn Staying awake enough to you Yeah, I know it's slipping at the edge Holdin' something we don't need All this delusion in our heads It's gonna bring us to our knees We're gonna feelin' that I'm goin' under But I know that I'll make it out alive If I quit calling you my lover Come on, let it go Just let it be Why don't you be old I'll be old Everything is wrong Leave it to the breeze Why don't you be old I'll be old Just like a walk onto a plane I'm only learning how could I sense the pain Your bits are hot cold to the tide Now we're eating for our soul I'm left seeing red on my own I'm gonna feelin' that I'm goin' under But I know that I'll make it out alive If I quit calling you my lover Come on, let it go Just let it be I'm shaking pullin' onto my knees Now that I'm without your kisses I'll be needed stitches I'm tripping over myself I'm making you to come now And now that I'm without your kisses I'll be needed stitches Come on, let it go Just let it be Why don't you be old I'll be old Everything is wrong Leave it to the breeze Why don't you be old I'll be old I'll be old I'll be old
