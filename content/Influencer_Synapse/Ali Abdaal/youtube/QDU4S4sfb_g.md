## Transcript
 Hey friends, welcome back to the vlog now. A question that no one ever asks me is, Ali, you're a doctor who saves lives and stuff, what do you do when you're not a work? So to answer that question, I'll take you through a random day off where I tried my best to be super productive to combat the inevitable existential dread. Normally, I wake up at 6.30 to get to work on time, but today I set my alarm for 7.30 a.m., but end up snoozing it until half past 8. And then just lying in bed doing absolutely nothing until 9. At 9 a.m., I negotiate myself out of bed into the shower and into a somewhat fresh pair of clothes. By 9.30, I've packed my bag and I'm ready to leave the house, but the urge to open my bowels delays me by another 20 minutes. Not to have my productivity thwarted by mere biology. I bust out my phone and start writing the voice over script for this very video. I leave the house at 10 a.m. and drive to Cambridge Town Centre, parking in the grand arcade shopping centre. By 10.30, I've taken a seat at my favorite coffee shop in town, Jamaica Blue, and after ordering a cheeky latte and vegan brunch, hashtag save the planet. I make a start on marking some physiology essays. It takes me around an hour and a half to get through 5 of the 10 essays that I need to mark. But alongside, I keep track of what factors go into a good essay for an upcoming video. For example, I immediately realise why the introduction of an essay is so vitally important, because it's actually really hard as an examiner to actually maintain concentration and read and understand every word of a student's essay, especially if the handwriting isn't great. But there's usually a pretty good correlation between how good the introduction is and how good the overall essay is. This is something I like to call the halo effect. So if you're a student writing an essay, you want your introduction and general production value of the essay, you know, the handwriting the diagrams. You want all of that to be fairly top-notch, so that if an examiner is feeding lazy, they're more tempted to give you a high mark because immediately at a glance they see that your essay looks the part. Anyway, at 1215 p.m., I head to the restaurant bills for lunch with a lovely chap called Liam, who I randomly ran into outside the hospital a few days ago. He recognized me from my videos. We had a brief chat and turns out he's an ex-professional footballer who's now a business coach who helps grow and scale businesses. This is exactly what I'm trying to do at the moment, and so we arranged to meet up and we end up chatting about general life and business strategy for the next hour and a half. At 2 p.m., we part ways and thanks to all the T and coffee I'd consume throughout the morning, I end up taking another trip to the bathroom. Again, I never let mere physiology get in the way of my productivity, and so while in the bathroom I have a go at the daily challenge on the brilliant iPhone app. The daily challenges are great because they give you a problem, introduce you to the main concepts you need to solve it, and then let you have a go at applying that knowledge. This particular challenge is a variation on the Sudoku theme, and I find that it exercises my mind while my digestive systems in overdrive. If you like the problem and want to learn more, you can go through the relevant course to explore it in more detail, and I particularly enjoy the computer science courses they've got on Brilliant. I've been coding since the age of 12, but before I discovered Brilliant, I didn't bother trying to learn the fundamentals of computer science, or the principles behind algorithms and stuff, so it's really helpful understanding that stuff at this stage. If you'd like to shop on your own mind with the maths, science, and computer sciences courses on Brilliant, you can sign up at Brilliant.org for what's slash Ali, or click the link in the video description, and the first 200 people to use the coupon code Ali at checkout will get 20% of the annual premium subscription isn't that exciting. After extricating myself, from the bills bathroom, I decided to have another work session and head to my second favorite study location in town, and that's the Waterstone's Book Shop Cafe. I grab a cheeky, old, great tea, and spend another 90 minutes finishing marking the essays. I find that marking essays is actually quite fun when you're doing it in a nice, a billy location with good ambience, and by the end of it, I've refreshed my knowledge of nerves, muscles, and cardiac physiology, which is a good bonus. At 330 pm, I quickly go through the mock exam paper that my students and I will be going over that evening to make sure that most of it makes sense, and then at 340 pm, I head out of waterstones and back into the grand arcade shopping centre to pick up a new bike. The bike shop guy recognizes me from YouTube, and actually has his own YouTube channel, and so we chat a bit about what's like to be a delisted celebrity, and about creating content on the internet. By 430 pm, the bike is sorted, I've done a test ride, and so I grab some donuts for the students as a new year's treat, and drive over to go to college for the physiology supervision. The supervision lasts around an hour, and in that time we go through the mock multiple choice exam paper that they all did yesterday under time conditions, and I give them some general advice about what makes a good essay. At 630 pm, I drive back into town, park in some random side road, and make my way towards Anglia Ruskin University's Mumford Theatre, for this year's Adam Brooks Pantamime, which is put on by medical students at Cambridge University, and this year it's called The Little Mermaid. It tells a story of a natural science student called Ariel, who's desperate to become a medical student, and the evil octopus Ursula who's trying to take over the world. I took part in the Pantamime for all three of my clinical years, first as a singing treat member, then as a director, and then as a cast member, and aside from this YouTube channel, it's the most rewarding thing I've ever done in my life, and so it'll always have a place in my heart. Personal favorites from this year were a parody of Shawn Mendez's absolute bang-up treat you better, which in this context was all about the NHS, the UK's National Health Service, and how it's terrible, and how we can treat you better with private health care. And a parody of the classic song you've got a friend in me, except they changed the lyrics so it's you've got an STD instead. For the under-14s amongst us, STD stands for sexually transmitted disease. Sorry YouTube, please don't demonetize this video. The Pantamime finishes at 11pm. I say hello to a few people outside the theatre, and then drive home to back up the corpus footage I filmed from today. I make my customary night time peppermint tea and sit on the sofa to write the script for this very video. Then, at around 13 am, I decide to leave the house and head home to some organs where my family lives. And on the way, I pick up one of my friends who's staying over tonight. So that is basically the end of this kind of day in the life. What I get up to on a day off work. I hope you found that vaguely entertaining, enjoyable, useful, possibly not.
