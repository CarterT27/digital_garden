## Transcript
 Hey friends welcome back to the channel. If you're new here, my name is Ali and I'm a doctor working in Cambridge and today We're gonna be going through 35 my favorite iPad Pro apps and just for your convenience I've split them up into five categories and those are create consume coordinate Connect and Serubrate the last ones a bit weird, but it had to be five seas and we've got timestamps in the video description and an opinion comments You can skip around as I feel like it, but yeah, let's just get into it So we've got nine apps in the create category and the create categories for kind of creation of things So for me that's mostly writing and photo related things and the first app on this list is a draft A draft is fantastic because it's basically a really great tool for quick capture So anytime I have a thought wherever I am I can open up the drafts app and any of my platforms I've had iPhone Apple Watch or Mac and I can just immediately start writing it down So normally when you open up draft it opens up to a new note so you can just kind of start typing straight away And so for example over here I was taking some notes on a podcast that I was listening to in the car and I suspect that I dictated this one into my Apple Watch Because obviously I was driving and I couldn't type anything out Or for example if I'm if I'm planning out like a study with me video Then I will use drafts to type out all the things that I'm doing throughout the day And it's basically a nicer alternative to the default Apple Notes app which it doesn't have dictation support built in Next on the create list we have a notion and I've made three videos about notion already talking about how I use it As my favorite productivity app how I use it as a resonance calendar and how I do my annual reviews using notion and I pretty much use notion to organize absolutely everything in my life So like for example all the video ideas that I've got I also use it to track my workouts at the gym So since the 23rd of September I've been tracking all my workouts in notion and I've got 19 times since then It's not bad. I think I did reasonably well in December, but then you know I had like a 10 day break and I only went to the gym earlier today. I'm sorry. It's bad And there's absolutely loads of other ways that I use notion for like studying for productivity and that sort of stuff And I've actually got a new series of videos called Workflow where I take a deep dive into some of the ways that I use some of my favorite apps Including notion and all the videos in this workflow series are available on Nebula which is a new streaming platform that's built by a team of Creators that I happen to be a part of it's sort of like a playground where creators can experiment with different types of content Without worrying about the YouTube algorithm. So I've got like tons of apps on my iPad iPhone Mac and I want to just kind of Deep dive into all the niche nerdy specifics of how I use them to maximize my productivity But that sort of kind of granular level of detail doesn't really work well on YouTube and so I've put those videos in this Workflow series on Nebula and so far there are four videos on there and I'm going to be adding loads more over time So if you're a subscriber to Nebula you can access them on my Nebula profile But very excitingly we've actually teamed up with CuriosityStream who are sponsoring this video CuriosityStream as you probably know is the ultimate documentary streaming subscription platform and because they support independent creators What they've done is that if you have a CuriosityStream membership or a free trial you automatically get free access to Nebula So a CuriosityStream subscription is less than three dollars a month and so four three dollars a month you get access to this like huge library of eight documentaries on CuriosityStream Which are amazing but also all this independent stuff created by creators and Nebula Including some of the niche videos that I won't necessarily put on YouTube Thirdly let's talk about the old boomer of the app kind of ecosystem and that is ever Not ever knows been around for years. I've been using evonaut since like 2011 or something I often get comments on on my notion video saying that oh, you know, why haven't you replaced evonaut with notion? And I don't really see them as you know notion replacing evonaut I think evonaut is fantastic because it's still probably the most comprehensive note taking out part there And it really excels in the note taking department. I've got like notebooks for everything. I can think of and And the way I think of evonaut is that it's sort of like my long-term memory So what I use notion for is for things like project management and to do lists and for projects that are Important but not necessarily urgent whereas evonaut is where I store a lot of the kind of archives or highlights from books and articles that I've read Or kind of random bits of writing that I've done because the great thing about evonaut is that you can just search for whatever you want So let's say I'm writing one of my weekly email newsletter path productivity for example I can just search my notes for the word productivity And now immediately I will get all of the notes that I've ever saved since 2011 I have the word productivity in them or I can search for more specific things or whatever But it's just a fantastic kind of bank of stuff like to access the long-term memory that you can search through and The other apps like notion don't quite have those features yet So who knows one day I might replace evonaut with one of these hot new note taking apps but so far I haven't managed to do that just yet and I'm gonna be trying apps like room research and stuff But I suspect evonaut is gonna be a big part of my kind of second brain for quite a long time Just because I've got so much stuff in there and it's really good and it's easy to search Fourthly let's talk about Ulysses and Ulysses is a very specific writing app That's available only for iPad and Mac so if you're an iOS user then this is fantastic It's probably the most pleasurable writing experience I've made a video before about this Apple smart keyboard thing and how it's the nicest typing experience I've ever experienced Writing in Ulysses is the nicest writing experience I've ever experienced and so if I'm writing like long form things like my weekly email newsletter Then I usually open up Ulysses create a new thing I type in it using Markdown so I can use hashtag email I don't know I think we're an issue 95 of my weekly email newsletter It's called Sunday snippets you can sign up for the link in the description if you like But you know I would I would use you this season You know I'd be able to kind of write whatever I want I can insert in like quotes This is a quote and it's just like a really nice pleasurable markdown writing experience So this is what I use for long form writing which is still under the create category point number five is an app that I've Started to use a bit less, but I still use sometimes and that is bear Bear is sort of like a cross between drafts and Ulysses in that it's very good as like a general Catch-all note taking up, but it's also a really nice writing experience so you know You can make a new note in bear and just like with Ulysses you can write in markdown And from bear you can do things like published a PDF or text documents or word documents or even published two word press and ghosting and things like that And the times when I use bear mostly are if I've got my phone or iPad handy And I want to take kind of medium form notes on something so let's say I'm listening to a podcast at the gym I might just open up bear on my iPhone and then then be like you know Tim Ferris episode with Jim Collins and then I would kind of take a few notes on that as I kind of come across stuff and I would normally kind of Reference the timestamp that I've heard that bit in the podcast so if I want to come back to it at a later date I'll be able to see it But yeah, I don't really use bear that much anymore like drafts has sort of replaced its functionality for me Just because drafts is available in the Apple Watch and has like an amazing mutation features So I feel like I might as well use draft Ab number six is noteability and noteability is what I use for handwritten notes all of the other note taking apps that I've been talking about Are absolutely terrible like in that they don't have very good Apple Pencil support So if I'm in a lecture for example a medical lecture and there's lots of evidence that kind of writing notes by hand Is better for our retention and understanding of the sort of the subject than typing them out while we're listening to the lecture Then I will open up noteability and I will kind of do handwritten notes. So for example Let's see near exam. So this was Handwritten notes that I've made throughout medical school including kind of various bits of this was a course that I went on with That was teaching us about neurology and how to do a neurologic examination So I took kind of photos of the course book put them into noteability and it took them This sort of stuff you just can't really do in any other app that I've found I've tried using good notes. I do actually have good notes installed But after doing like extensive testing of both of them I decided that no stability was better And I'm gonna be making a more dedicated review about good notes versus no stability because everyone seems to have that question But yeah, so far I'm much prefer no stability and I just kind of use it for all my handwriting needs Seventhly we've got day one and day one is the best journaling app for iPad iOS and Mac and it's just like a journal So I have I have different journals within day one I've got my actual journal which I'm not gonna show you because that's private for my eyes only little I have like a journal of nice comments or ice cream shot and you know copy and paste nice comments People have got so this was a comment that I got one of the one of the videos I'm showing you because it was a public comment on the video. It wasn't a private email And I just like collecting these kind of nice comments and how many have I never got 421 of them So if I'm feeling sad I just kind of have a flick through my nice comments and then just kind of read some of them I'm gonna think it's just quite nice when you make videos and you just kind of interacting with strangers across the internet mostly It's nice having like a place to put kind of nice things I don't know I don't think it's a it's a nothing to have Also go a memorability memorabilia journal where I usually You know take photos of like birthday cards or letters or you know things things like that that I kind of want to throw away Because I don't like keeping paper around but you know I take the photos put them in memorabilia This was actually something that I picked up while watching like minimalism related videos because we all say that oh this this thing is a memory there I don't want to get rid of it But you kind of just take a photo of it and then get rid of it. So I started kind of doing that and I've got loads of stuff in an I photos photo album with memorabilia. I just need to transfer it all into day one just so it's all in one place Next we have light room and light room is the app that I use for all my photo editing needs when I'm posting photos to the Gram so for example while I was the work the other day with my iPad out This was a photo that I took to put on the Gram but this is the edited version and this is the I've not edited version So I just applied like a preset to a did some hue saturation adjustment. They are sort of stuff on light room And it's quite nice like that. So just kind of transforms standard photos into slightly nicer photo. So this is before editing and this is after editing it just kind of makes it pop a little bit more Let's do another example. This was some like a random selfie that I took in bed that looked like this Normally with my iPhone then I applied a few edits in light room to it and it looks like this Just thinks a little bit nicer. So I like editing photos in light room before putting them on the Gram And finally we have a really good app called spark post in this category and this is the app that I use to make all of my thumbnails So the great thing about this is that you can just add a photo and then You can just like move stuff around. So if I wanted to change things with this thumbnail Like it's sort of do it like this. I could move this around Like that can go sort of in the middle and might think the background is not dark enough. So I can adjust the darkness of the background sort of like this and this is yeah, it's just like a nice uniform way of making these thumbnails So those were the apps in the create category. Let's now talk about seven apps in the consumer category So in the consumer category we've got seven apps and that's for things like watching listening to and reading stuff So the first app in this category is InstaPaper and InstaPaper is what I use to store articles that I want to read later So you know InstaPaper has like share extensions for everything on iOS So if I want if I get a link and I don't have time to read it there and then I just share it to InstaPaper It's also got an email address that you can email stuff to those loads of ways of getting stuff into InstaPaper And it's basically a library of articles that I'm going to read so that when I have a spare moment of time in the toilet or on a train or on a bus or whatever I usually like the first app that I go to is usually InstaPaper and then I find not to call that I want to read and then I can read it And I don't see any ads. I don't see any kind of like pointless website stuff I just see the article in this nice typography and the great thing about InstaPaper is that you can highlight stuff So this is an article about anti-frightal planning that I read a few days ago and I've highlighted various bits of it So to highlight stuff he just literally press on it drag and highlight and And the really cool thing is that when I highlight stuff it automatically gets synced to Evernote via a service called Readwise and actually one of the episodes of workflow that series that I've got Nebula talks about exactly how this whole thing works behind the scenes and the benefits that I found With exporting my all my InstaPaper highlights to Evernote and the various ways in which I use them So just to remind you if you want to hear more about this process and why I find it useful you can check that video on Nebula Alternatively if you've got a curiosity stream membership which you should because it's amazing and really cheap and just gives you loads of documentaries If you have a curiosity stream membership you get free access to Nebula as well So you can just find my niche videos about this workflow stuff while I'll explain all this stuff in much more detail But yeah, InstaPaper is what I used to read stuff next. We have the Kindle app The Kindle app is amazing because I don't actually read much on the Kindle app on my iPad But for example if I'm reading a non-fiction book and want to take notes on it I would usually open it up in Kindle and then I'll have a split screen with drafts You to seize or bear and so what I can do is that while reading in Kindle I can kind of take notes on the side The other great thing about the Kindle app is again. It's got a highlight feature and I've I've been highlighting stuff on Kindle since like 2010 or 2008 when I first got a Kindle and another great thing about Kindle is that all my Kindle highlights are again Singe to Evernote using Readwise and and again to plug Nebula. I've got another video about how the Kindle Readwise everno integration works With some examples of how I've used this export feature of Kindle highlights and why I found it immensely valuable to save all of my Kindle highlights to Evernote So again, you should sign up to Nebula via CuriosityStream, sign up to CuriosityStream You'll get free access to Nebula link in the video description and then you can see these videos if you're interested in seeing me talk about the stuff in like really Ainal detail next in terms of consuming stuff. We've got Spotify Spotify's my streaming app of choice I have tried Apple Music. I still subscribed to Apple Music because I forgot into council my subscription. I think But you know, I've really tried hard. I tried for about six months to switch, you know, exclusively to Apple music And I just couldn't do it and I went back to Spotify and it's just so nice and I actually love Spotify It's just so glorious and I have different playlist for every year of med school and beyond My most famous playlist is the study with me playlist which currently has 23,700 followers And this has filled up like a thousand instrumental tracks from like various sources classical music film music TV shows You know planet earth Hans Zimmer all this stuff loads of stuff from game of thrones So when I'm studying then I put this on and none of these songs have any words in them So they don't interfere with the word processing which can sometimes some some of the evidence says is not good When you try to learn stuff But there also makes studying much more fun because I've got this like you know parts of the Caribbean banging in the background while I'm trying to Not about respiratory physiology. So yeah, I'll spotify for consuming music then we have an RSS feed reader app And that is called unread now RSS feeds are amazing and also I'm gonna do a workflow video about this on Nebula Just because there's a lot to dig into about how to set up an RSS feed and and like how to set it up But feedly and how to get into an app and various use cases for RSS feeds But essentially RSS feeds are how I keep up with all the blogs that I follow and I sometimes get comments from people who read my weekly email news letters Sunday snippets think that it's really a description if you want to sign up I get emails from people saying go oh, you know you've shared these three really good articles this week How did you come across this stuff like how do you keep up with the stuff and I don't usually have time to reply to all of these But now I'm saying it now it's all based on RSS feeds So you kind of subscribe to different blogs and then you get to see them all in one place So I've got 156 on read articles and so let's say I want to read this article in the journal of medical ethics But let's say I don't quite have time But I can say it into into into into into into paper and so then whenever I want I can then read it on insta paper And it just immediately lets me see what all of the blogs that I've followed published But yeah, more on that in the workflow series on Nebula which is gonna be appearing later this month Next we have curiosity stream itself who was kind of sponsoring the video. Thanks guys curiosity stream world's best documentary streaming subscription platform founded by John Hendrix who's the founder of the discovery channel And on curiosity stream you've got thousands of documentaries across all sorts of genres Some of the ones that I personally enjoy are about nutrition trying to get better at cooking and healthy eating and stuff So there's a really good series of about nutrition that I've been watching recently But yeah, there's other documentaries on curiosity stream and as I've said because curiosity stream are amazing and Support independent creators they're partnering up with us that Nebula So if you subscribe to curiosity stream you get free access to Nebula So go to curiosity stream.com forward slash Ali and enter the coupon called Ali at checkout and that will give you a Free trial that you can sample all the documentaries to your hearts content and then an annual subscription is like less than three dollars a month Which is totally worth it for these amazing documentaries and this amazing like independent content on Nebula Apple number six is YouTube I'm not really gonna talk about that because YouTube is not very exciting, but you know, we all know what YouTube does And finally the app that I use to read PDF normally is PDF expert Which actually started using recently previously. I used to only read PDFs and notoriety because I'd be able to annotate them using the apple pencil But PDF expert is genuinely quite nice for kind of reading PDFs and the nice thing about this which like newtability Can't do is that it automatically works out like the structure of of the PDFs So you can kind of skip around so for example in this Oxford handbook of emergency medicine There's like different bits of this and I can actually Skip around to the different sections using the sidebar whereas if I were reading this PDF from notoriety I would have to like scroll absolutely tons or use to search feature or weird things like that But yeah if I'm reading the structured PDF like an ebook then I'll use PDF expert for that So those were the seven apps in the consumer category. Let's now move on to the coordinate category And in the coordinate series it's sort of like productivity general utilities But it had to stop with a C which is why it's called coordinate so you know Email client the one that I use is superhuman and superhuman is a bit weird because it costs $30 a month to check your email But it's speeded up my email workflow by about two x so given that I spend so much time doing emails I'm more than happy to pay $30 a month to cut that time down by a significant chunk and so with these emails for example I can immediately just like get rid of them Thomas Frank. Oh, he's got a new habits course and it just kind of makes it a bit more of a pleasure to get through email And so it just kind of makes sense Apple number two is fantastical fantastical is my calendar app of choice and the nice thing about fantastical is that it's got really good natural language processing And that's the main reason why I use it so if I wanted to create a new event I can say Jam session with Sahel and Katharine 18th Jan 10 a.m. at Sahel's house and what it's going to do is it's going to Recognize all the metadata in that and it's created this event jams session with Sahel and Katharine the location is Sahel's house And it's at 10 a.m. so like it just makes it so easy to put events into my calendar which means that I actually now use a calendar Next in the coordinate category we have to do is to do is to manage my to do lists I used to use things in the video this time last year. I was using things three But then I thought I'd try to do is because it's a bit more cross-platform It is available on windows unlike things and I just kind of thought that you know why not give this a go To be honest the apps don't really matter and I say this in like a long-ass video about all the apps that I use The apps really don't matter what matters is the principles and then any app that kind of does the job fulfills fulfills that purpose if you get one I mean anyway, so into do-est I keep track of everything I need to do But it's all of the Usually kind of time sensitive stuff That normally has some kind of a deadline So for example if it's a shopping list or if it's a reminder to water the plans or to call my grandma or to kind of do these little bits and bobs like Submit something to the PMJ It's tough to my Medicine E portfolio kind of little things like that then I would put those into do-est Whereas if it's like bigger projects like an online course or like a video series and stuff that would go in notion So I use notion for big project management and I used to do it for little things and remind us to call my grandma and to water the plants and to publish the podcast and email news Let's hope which I actually did on Sunday I haven't yet watered the plants. I should have done that yesterday So it's just a reminder for me to water the plants next we have white Studio and the nice thing about this is that it shows all the comments across all my videos in chronological order So one thing I like to do is reply to any specific questions if I can on YouTube comments if I've got some time And so when I'm on the toilet or whatever and I do have time to reply to stuff instead of using YouTube the actual app I use the YouTube studio app and that lets me kind of reply to people and stuff It also lets me kind of change like descriptions of videos update thumbnails that sort of stuff And so it's just generally quite nice to have as a YouTube creator for more apps and I'm just gonna blitz through first We've got Google Drive that I use just basically my my entire life is stored on Google Drive So everything is in there next we've got frame.io Which is a good video collaboration platform so for example If my editor Christian is editing a video he uploads it to frame.io and then I can like comment on the different timestamps in the video And so we can kind of collaborate on what the edit should look like ultimately then on this screen We've got the app zero that are used for accounting for my business and we've got dash lane Which is my password manager of choice again Not gonna show you any of my passwords within that But yeah, those are the apps in the coordinate category to help me coordinate my life keep my life together Be organized to be productive all that good stuff All right, we have four apps in the connect category that allows me to connect to other people and the most important one that I use every day is Slack And I'm part of a few different Slack groups. This one is called the round reads. There's a a blogger that I follow called Kay he I think that's how you pronounce his name But this is really nice like Slack group where everyone who kind of follows him is part of this group You know entrepreneurship money productivity books Financial independence, you know stuff like that and people are just generally nice very friendly and kind of share recommendations for interesting articles There's also the 40 labs Slack group. This is another blog that I follow and has the course building a second brain that I took a few months ago And also standard which is the agency that I'm part of that's full of creators and standard is the agency that's built nebula again You know standard accuracy stream please You'll get free access to nebula blah blah blah all that stuff you had it before and then there's The team of people that helped me out with my stuff. So normally I used to come to chat with question my editor But if there's other people helping out with writing content and doing other stuff that helped me out Then they go into the eight team Slack channels, so that's like my team name the eight team It's a bit tongue-in-cheek haven't really figured out a proper name for it, but that's what it is for now Next we have discord and discord is very exciting because a few weeks ago I set up a discord server and so far we've got how many we've got 259 people online and I think like 5000 people in the server and total and it's got like fancy bots and stuff and answer people that ask for help with their homework You know studying is pretty active. We've got a group for podcasts books productivity tech where we discuss all this kind of stuff Again link in the video description if you want to join the discord. It's free and you know I just hang out there sometimes if I'm pretty bored. I'm like, you know what I don't want to make a video today And we just go and discord and reply to some people. So this is how I like you know chat with people in sort of real time on discord I want to make more use of it when I've got actual time off work So maybe kind of use it using it within gaming haven't quite decided yet, but yeah, it's all very nice It's very wholesome. You should definitely join the community on discord next just quickly the app that used for Twitter is tweet bot I think exciting here. It's a Twitter app and the app that I use for messages is Apple messages and Obviously messages are synced across my phone Apple Watch Mac, iPad, etc And it's probably one of the main reasons why I don't use any kind of non-alcohol products just because It's so convenient when you can reply to text on your laptop or on your iPad or on your phone depending on which device you have Rather than having to always type out stuff on your phone, which is what I would have to do if I were using an Android phone And finally at the end of this incredibly long video We've got six apps that I use for studying and learning stuff And I've had to call this Sarah Brit because that sort of means thinking and it's total to the sea So now we've got five seas within this video. I hope you guys appreciate the effort that it takes to make up stuff like this And the first app on this list is brilliant brilliant is like an online courses platform that helps you learn stuff with daily Challenges and things they sponsored loads of my videos so I use brilliant when I'm Feeding like I want to kind of get an injection of knowledge into my head Secondly, we've got Skillshare which is a platform for online classes again they sponsored some of the videos I've actually got my own course in Skillshare like 33 videos 35 videos something like that about how to edit videos in Final Cut Pro Yeah three hours and 15 minutes long So if you want to become a youtuber in edit videos like this one you can check out my course on Skillshare if you like Next we have Ankeen which is my flashcard app of choice and Ankees what I used while throughout medical school to learn drugs and Announce me and all sorts of stuff and now I'm sort of using Ankeen to help prepare for my postgraduate medical exams I'll be doing much more videos about that in depth Probably on workflow first that series on Nebula but then in the videos that do well I'll kind of distill them into youtube videos in a few months time that's the plan next we have tabs HD which is Basically like let's you get chords for any song in the world so let's say I want to play I don't know fearless by Taylor Swift I can just find the chords for it. So it would it would give me the lyrics give me the chords So if I'm playing on a piano or the guitar I can be like Hey, there's something about the way the street looks when it's just right. There's a glow of the pay Whatever, I could do that all playing guitar and piano I can also trans post stuff so I have this set of trans poses minus five because I can't sing the song and it's normal pitch because my voice is quite deep Therefore I transpose it down a few semi tones the app does it automatically it's great And yeah, you can just kind of play anything in the world if you just have the chords for it and you can sing along It's fantastic and finally I want to talk about notion again because I do actually use notion for studying I'll show you some of my notes in notion We've got let's see where are we? Home means physiology or homeostasis So within the topic of nerves for example, I've got essays within this database that are related to the topic of nerves I've got key active recall questions that I've again got in notion and I basically just have all the notes that I've written for this topic Organize a notion with a different topic titles and the nice thing about notion is got this toggle feature So you can kind of hide loads of information inside these toggle bars But if you want to hear more about the stuff, I actually talked about it in a live stream that I did in the official notion of his hours And actually the recordings from that are available as part of the workflow series on nebula So as a very final plug if you want to hear me dive more into detail about a lot of these apps including notion You should check out the series on nebula and if you don't have a nebula subscription That's fine. You can sign up to curiosity stream free trial subscription and you'll get free access to nebula automatically So you can support independent creators like me because you know, there's no ads on it We just get a cut of the kind of subscription revenue which is fantastic There's no algorithms you see everything that ever created produces Thirdly you can see all the stuff in my workflow series and finally you've got loads of other content from loads of other independent creators And actually we've got this really cool series called working titles where different creators break down like How different title screens and like title animations of different TV shows are made so we've got one for house It's done by my friend Medlife crisis Dr. Rohan he's a cardiologist working in London and loads of other TV shows as well And we've had loads of emails from people saying that just that series working titles Is alone worth the price of the nebula curiosity stream subscription So if you want to check it out you can but yeah that was 35 apps across five different categories This is the annual video that I do every year It's always really long and I was kind of updated a little bit with new apps that I'm using so if you've got this file And thank you so much for watching if you like the video please give it a thumbs up if you like this video You will like firstly the works of videos in the nebula series, but also I'll put a playlist over there somewhere that has like more App themed videos that you might like thank you so much for watching and I'll see you in the next video.
