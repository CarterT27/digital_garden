## Transcript
 Whether in a personal or professional lives, we're constantly bombarded by external noise. What if we could develop a mindset that both cut out that noise and helped to clarify our own intentions free from the influence of others? What if we could learn that mindset, not from top executives or the richest people in the world? But instead, from the humble monk. This is what monk and current celebrity YouTuber Jay Shetty talks about in his new book, Think Like a Monk, which, unsurprisingly, is the subject of this episode of Book Club, the series where I distill and discuss highlights from some of my favorite books. In the book, Jay takes the wisdom and traditions of monks and teaches us how we can apply them to live less anxious and more meaningful lives. Drawing upon ancient wisdom and his own experience, Jay outlines how the thinking of monks offers valuable lessons that are pertinent even in the 21st century. But he doesn't want to sort of suddenly become monks instead he wants us to think like them to help combat the anxieties and pressures that we face in the modern world. The book divided into three parts that's letting go, giving and growing and so we're going to discuss each of those in turn and figure out what lessons we can take from the book to apply to our own lives. Part one is about letting go and this revolves around four key pillars. Finding our identity, reducing negativity, detaching from fear and learning to live intentionally. Firstly, we need to address our identity, which, as Jay says, is intrinsically wrapped up in our values. He points out that actually a lot of the values that we think we hold, they're not necessarily our own, but we've acquired them through societal conditioning. He writes, when we tune out the opinions, expectations and obligations of the world around us, we begin to hear ourselves. And the idea is that if we can filter out this noise and give us the space to consider our own values, then we can begin to direct our lives towards higher values, like gratitude, service, truthfulness and compassion, which ultimately propel us towards happiness, fulfillment and meaning, and away from lower values like greed, lust, anger and envy, which ultimately just pushes towards anxiety, depression and suffering. The next part of letting go is addressing negativity, which is one of those things that we always come across. And if you're anything like me, you can sometimes let it affect your day and kind of get to you in a way that you wouldn't like. But as Jay says in the book, negativity is a trait, not someone's identity, and so we can learn to let it go. Monks talk about the process of awareness, addressing and amending, which Jay distills down to a three stage process of spot, stop, and swap. So this three part process of observing, reflecting, and then modifying our behavior, it's kind of what the stoics used to talk about as well, and it's a really good way of addressing negativity, but it's also a pretty good way of addressing fear, which is part three of letting go. Monks believes that the root cause of fear is closely related to attachment or are need to own or control things. If the cause of fear is attachment, Jay says that the cure for fear is detachment. We might sometimes think that detachment means indifference, but actually Jay has a really good quote for this. He says that detachment is not that you should own nothing, but that nothing should own you. And again, this is a classic stoicism concept that I think about a lot. Like when it comes to being attached to stuff like tech or keyboards or cameras or even our friends and family, stoicism teaches us that these things are preferred in difference, that I can prefer to have a 49 inch ultra wide monitor with the fancy asked keyboard and mouse, but it's ultimately an indifferent, I don't need it to be happy, I'm not attached to it. The final part of letting go involves questioning ourselves so that we can live more intentionally. Jay talks about how our motivations revolve around fear, desire, duty and love. And he talks about the why ladder as a way of understanding or through motivations for doing stuff. He writes, to live intentionally, we must dig to the deepest why behind the want. And this can be quite a fun thing to do or maybe not because it involves questioning ourselves until we can get to the root of our intentions. So if I were to ask myself, why don't I want to make YouTube videos? One reason might be because I wanted to teach people and I want to help people in inspire others or things like that. But then if I was to why did I want to do that? I'd probably say, well, I want to do that because it seems like fun. And if I asked why does that seem like fun, then I might get to the true cause, which is that secretly I crave the admiration and respect of other people. And that's why I'm making YouTube videos like this one. Anyway, by living intentionally without negativity and without fear, we can begin to let go of the stuff that's been holding us back. And we can make space for the second part of the book which talks about growth. As with letting go, growth also revolves around some key principles, which include finding our purpose, training our mind and mastering our ego. So if we start with purpose, J talks about how we can identify our Dharma, which is a Sanskrit term that roughly translates in English to your calling. He says that finding on Dharma isn't just about figuring out our passion and skill, but it's about figuring out a passion and skill that we have that can also be useful to others. And so passion plus expertise plus usefulness equals Dharma. And there's a nice quote here, which is, our passion becomes our purpose when we use it to serve others. If you're like me and you haven't quite figured out what your Dharma or your purpose or your mission or your calling in life is, then one way of figuring this out is by using the quadrants of potential as J calls it. Many of us spend most of our days in quadrant one, skill no passion, or quadrant four, passion no skill. But to actually grow and develop our purpose, we should aspire to be in quadrant two, skill and passion so that we're spending our time using our talents doing what we love. So ultimately by combining passion with expertise in the service of others, crucially, that helps us figure out a purpose and figure out where we're going to go. There's a more capitalist version of the Dharma equation, which is sort of how I think about it, which is that what do I enjoy? What am I good at? And what will the market pay me for? And the market will pay me for something. It's sort of a proxy for this is useful to other people. So that's another way of framing it if you find the sort of idea of how can this be useful to others a little bit hard to wrap your head around. So step one along this journey of personal growth is finding our purpose. And then step two is developing the right mindset. And here, J gives us the comparison between the monk mind and the monkey mind. The monkey mind is one that struggles with overthinking business and switches aimlessly from thought to thought. The monk mindset on the other hand lifts us out of our confusion and distraction and helps us find clarity, meaning and direction. And like, as I'm saying this, I'm recognizing that this stuff can seem very abstract. Firstly, you should read the book because it's good and he gives more practical advice about this. And there's only so much I can squeeze into like, I don't know, a 10 minute long YouTube video. But essentially, the way to change any kind of mindset or develop any kind of mindset is to use J's three pot framework or a variance of it, which is spot, stop and swap. And so if we find ourselves thinking in a certain thought pattern like recognizing a destructive pattern of thought, which itself takes some like practice, we observe it. So we spot. And then we stop thinking like it. And then we swap it for something else. And again, this is so much easier said than done. But it is ultimately the foundation that also things like cognitive behavior of therapy and stuff, rest on this idea that yes, we can control our thoughts and our actions. But it's only through practice that we can actually do that. Anyway, assuming we're all on this journey of getting a monk mind rather than a monkey mind, which is very much a work in progress for all of us, the third step on this path to growth is letting go of our ego. J talks about how the monks teach that our ego is one of the main obstacles to our growth. And in fact, most of our ego's are too faced in that one moment, it's telling us that we're the best. And the next moment, it's telling us that we're the absolute worst. J talks about how true humility is understanding that our mind wants to take us to one of these extremes and instead opting for a middle ground where we're actively recognizing our weaknesses and working to improve on them. And to help foster humility, there are two things we need to think about and two things we need to forget. We need to remember the bad that we've done to others and the good others have done for us and we need to forget the good that we've done for others and the bad that others have done to us. And if we can do this consistently, we are restraining our ego that wants to be selfish and think that we're the best and we're generally increasing our own gratitude and the gratitude that we put out to the world, which is always going to be a good thing. The final part of the book is probably the most important and it talks about how we can learn to look beyond just ourselves and instead think about how we might act in service to other people. The previous ideas of letting go and growing are ultimately about detaching ourselves from our own selfishness so that we're in a position to give back to society and to others through service. But although giving to other people is a fundamental part of service, the monks actually teach that there is some kind of reciprocal exchange going on in that when we serve others we actually feel good about ourselves. And Jake put it nicely when he says in the book that selflessness heals the self. Apparently loads of research about this as well that says that when you go after compassionate goals like serving other people in some way that actually leads to your own increased inner feelings of happiness and contentment. And the monks themselves talk about the four different ways in which giving service to other people helps ourselves. Firstly, it connects us. IE you have to actually go out into the world to help other people or put yourself out there on the internet which is a connecting thing. Secondly, it amplifies gratitude like giving to others and helping other people helps us realize how grateful we are for the things that we do have. Thirdly, it increases compassion. IE helps open up our eyes to the needs of other people which again is a good thing for ourselves. And fourthly it builds self esteem by giving us a mission and a meaning beyond just satisfying the self. And so ultimately thinking like a monk might seem like a bit of an abstract idea but as Jake talks about in the introduction like given the amount of anxiety and hecticness and freneticness that we've got in the world at the moment. Why wouldn't we learn from the people who are calm, peaceful and happy people like monks? So overall think like a monk, very good book definitely worth reading. There's going to be a link in the video description if you want to pick yourself up a copy if you haven't got it yet. Again in this video I've only touched on a sliver of the surface of the ideas in here. There's a lot more stuff. He illustrates it with lots of stories which is very nice. And of course you can check out J's YouTube channel which is a constant source of inspiration for many millions of people and J if you're watching this which is a collab sometime. If you like this episode you might like to check out this video here which is my book club episode of Ryan Holidays. The obstacle is the way which covers similar themes to think like a monk but approaches it from the lens of stoicism using lots of historical examples to check that out over there. Thank you so much for watching and I'll see you in the next video. Bye bye.
