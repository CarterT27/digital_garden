## Transcript
 Hey friends, welcome back to the channel. In this video we're going to be combining some of my favorite things in life so that's no taking studying tech apps and specifically one of my favorite apps of all time and that is notion and I'll be showing you how I take notes in medical school using notion and we'll split the video up into three parts of firstly understanding, second be memorising and thirdly organising and as usual you'll find timestamps to all of those things in the video description and in a pinned comment so you can skip around the video if you feel like it and just before we get started just to let you know the kind guys that notion are actually sponsoring this video and they've given a thousand codes that you can use to get a free personal plan for notion and I'll be telling you the details about that sometime in this video so please do make sure you watch the whole video if then you can catch this special code then you can get notion for free uh yeah let's move on. Okay so there's basically two main components of learning anything when we're at university and that is number one understanding and then secondly memorising and note taking itself like summarising content with the book open of summarising content from election notes in general according to the evidence base it's considered a fairly poor technique for retaining information but there are a few things we can do to our note taking technique to actually make it useful as a way of firstly understanding and secondly memorising the content so I will take you through my notion set up for human physiology which is a lecture series that I am helping teach medical students at the University of Cambridge and I'll show you how I use notion to well help understand and memorize the stuff so let's start with understanding and essentially we're going to take this topic which is cardiology and it's open it as page and I will dive into all the various bits so firstly I think one of the great things about notion that actually makes it separate to every single other note taking system is the fact that it's got the simple toggle thingies associated with it so basically like this and you can hide ton of information in toggles and you can make the toggles go as far as you want so for example you know learning objectives I've hidden that and within that we've got the seven seven learning objectives for this particular lecture uh within I don't know fetal circulation what if we got within within fetal circulation we've got handful of other uh of other toggles this one has nothing in it which is why it's gray but this one what is the oxygen dissociation curve for him a globe in look like comparing maternal versus fetal that has the oxygen dissociation curve where curve which I've screen shot it from my lecture notes and just shoved into notion because the notion is gray and it can take almost any type of content whether it's text, images, PDFs etc and it sort of makes it look quite pretty okay so how does this sort of thing help with understanding um so essentially when we're taking notes and anything it's it's really important that we keep in mind what the big picture is whereas it's very easy like especially when the subject is difficult it's really easy to just like focus in on the details so for example when I was going through medical school the the first time around I made the mistake initially of always focusing on the details because the amount of stuff we get tested on in our exams would be so my new and so like like almost pointless levels of detail that I would often sort of lose the forest from the trees as I were like I would be so deep down in the details that I would forget what the kind of big picture is but since discovering notion I've actually worked out a really good way of doing that and that is that I summarized basically all of the subheadings of my lecture notes so for example here lecture number one is overview plus why we need a circulation lecture number two is cardiac function lecture three hemodynamics and lecture four integration of reflex control but within this I have essentially turned all of the subheadings and the lecture notes into their own little toggles so if I want to revisit the lecture on cardiac function I can add a glance no exactly all the different topics that are in that lecture and if I want to dive into specific topic I can just you know sort the toggle out for it who discovered the ECG William I'm hoping an Augustus wall of 1909 I had no idea clearly I wrote it a few months ago when I was studying the topic for the first time that's a great thing about notion is let's you hide all the details within these toggles if if there was only one thing about notion that I think makes it fantastic for students it is literally just that toggle feature and it's such a simple feature that like literally no other note taking up has it's not in one note it's not an ever note it's not in no to abilities not in good notes it's not in like I don't even know what I don't know what I've been taking up so I have but this is this is amazing stuff so yeah going back to understanding having this sort of toggle thing lets us basically have kind of the big picture understanding of what's of what our content is just based on these toggles and the second way in which I think notion helps with understanding content is that basically whenever there's some extra information it's super easy to put it in the notes but again not lose track of the big picture so a problem I used to have when I was using one note and when I was using ever note is if there was a specific topic that I didn't quite understand and I wanted to kind of dive in in more detail into that topic it would end up clogging up my my notes quite a lot so back when I was using one note I was sort of have a side thing and ended up having sort of enormous horizontal scrolling canvas just trying to get extra information into it but notion makes this really easy and I'll show you in the nerves lecture series like a point where this illustrates this nicely so let's open it as a page we're talking about these essays in a little bit over here so this was lecture number five by electricity and membrane potentials and you know I was a little bit lazy I've summarized a few of the main points here and over here and then there was some extra stuff about membrane structure and about the nernst equation and the goldman Hodgkin cat's constant field equation that I knew I wanted to kind of make a note of but I didn't want it like plugging up my actual notes so with membrane structure for example I remember that while I was taking these notes I was doing it sort of in line because as as we're kind of going through the lectures we don't necessarily know exactly what are sort of end note state is going to look like but that's another thing notion really helps with so if I just kind of paste some of the stuff that I wrote about this you know I was talking about the history of membrane structure you know in 1774 a minimum frankly in blah blah blah and then in the 1890 load really and then a few decades later blah blah so I was writing all this sort of stuff and then as we got to around about this bit this fry and edited in Johns Hopkins bit I realized that actually this whole lecture is about biodiversity and membrane potentials and the structure of cell membranes is a fairly sort of it's an important part but it's not like a key structural part and I realized that I was actually you know losing the forest from the trees like I was so deep into the detail of membrane structure that it was clogging up the notes so the absolutely amazing thing that you can do in motion is you can just make a new page wherever you want and you can just put stuff in it so if I want a new page I can just write membrane structure for example and what I can do is I can click this little thing turn into page now membrane structure is a page it's a blank page at the moment let's add an icon to it let's make it pretty cell no battery let's do a battery because a cell cell is sort of like a battery that's kind of funny but now I've got this blank page where are we called membrane structure but the absolutely game changing thing for notion is what I can do is I can select all of this stuff all of this stuff that's totally irrelevant to sort of my main main lecture stuff and I can just drag and drop it straight into that page and so now if I click on membrane structure there we go we have retained the structure and the integrity of all of our notes but we've put it in a place where it sort of makes a bit more sense so those were just some of the ways in which notion by the way that it's designed actually helps me personally understand stuff a little bit better in a way that no other note taking out that I've seen does so that was understanding let's move on now to memorizing and how notion helps with that okay so having understood the topic how do we then commit it to memory and there's loads of effective revision techniques for doing that note taking is not one of them note taking is generally considered middle to bottom of the pile when it comes to efficiently trying to get stuff into our brains the stuff that does work is a technique called active recall which involves testing ourselves and stuff and a technique called space repetition which involves you know spacing or repetition of the topic over time and I've done lots of videos tackling those in in specific detail but in this video I want to show you how I use notion to help accomplish active recall and space repetition within the context of taking notes because just to retrace taking notes by itself you know if you're just copying notes out of a text book or typing up notes from a lecture that itself according to evidence is a very poor way of actually retaining the stuff but if you add these superchargy bits to note taking I think it becomes a fairly effective way of retaining stuff and that's what I'm going to go over in this video so firstly one of the techniques that I use to help memorize stuff using notion is something called the Cornell note taking system now the fantastic thing about the Cornell note taking system is that it's got active recall built into it so the problem with taking notes is that it's a very passive thing and usually when we reread on notes we're just passively rereading them or highlighting them or writing them out again which is a totally pointless and completely passive but the way that we can actually make our notes useful is by asking ourselves questions and essentially testing ourselves on the content so the way the Cornell method usually works is that on one side of the page you would have your notes and on the other side of the page you would write questions about those notes and so when you're going over your notes rather than just reading them you would cover up the side of the page that had the answers and just look at the questions and then you'd be like okay cool what are the four chambers of the heart and then that would be kind of the bit in your answer as a simple example and the way I use notion for this is again using the toggle feature which as I said is like the single best thing about notion so for example let's go into lecture one which is overview and why we need a circulation and within for example this topic of gross growth structure of the heart I've got a question for myself how much blood is the heart pump over a lifetime and at the moment I can't remember the answer to this and so I click on my toggle and it's like oh 200 million litres which is 500 to mink pulls 240 million joules of work that's quite a lot of work but like normally what I'd be tempted to do is like and I think what we're all tempted to do is we would have this information sort of like as bullet points in a way so for example we could turn this into bullet points and so for most of us when we'd see our notes would be gross so for the heart oh it you know 200 million litres 500 to something pulls but we wouldn't bother actively testing ourselves on that information and so the fact that it can go straight into a toggle and actually we can just drag and drop this in there means that when when I look at these notes now I'm actually forced to test myself on it so you know really I don't actually care about how much work the heart does but something like this is a lot more interesting so the gross structure of blood vessels I've got a toggle saying diagram of blood vessel structure with labels so you know at this point if I'm actually going through this properly I would get a piece of paper out I would draw a diagram of blood vessel structure with the labels on it and then I would click on the toggle and it would give me the answer but the point is I'm engaging brain beforehand I'm not just including the you know the diagram of the notes equally what is the tunica intimate made up of mostly endothelial cells isn't it? I endothelial cells and the acetic connective tissue so I missed out that bit so that bit you know but the point is I tried to drag out this information from my brain so the very fact that I tried to recall it will strengthen the the the memory in my mind was the tunica media made up of and I think this is mostly smooth muscle I want to say smooth muscle smooth muscle cells with bands fibers of an acetic tissue fine and was the tunica adventition made up of I would say mostly connective tissue like collagen and stuff. Collageness is actually a major to the fiber of blood vessels and nerves as rigidity and form to the blood vessels. Great but again the point is I'm asking myself the questions first and then I'm trying to answer them in my head or out loud or on paper or whatever and only then am I looking at the answers and this is basically the Cornell note taking method in action in notion and that turns on notes from a passively rereading pointless waste of time which is what I wonder what it would be by default into something that genuinely helps our brain develop because you know it's just so much research that shows that getting information out of our brain like active recall testing ourselves on the information is by far a better way of retaining that information then just rereading it and trying to put the information in again. So yeah that's all I'm going to say about active recall for now and I'll link a video up there and in the video description which is much like 25 minutes long about why active recall at the best thing ever and that talks about evidence and shows you animated graphs and all this stuff to really help drive home the message that active recall is a way of life and active recall is the single most valuable thing that any of us can do to get better in our exams and there's actually a really good book called Make It Stick which is about the science of the fact of learning and the authors of that book having studied hundreds of thousands of students say that you know if you're struggling if you're not getting the results that you want to get in school chances are you're just not testing yourself enough testing ourselves is the way to get better results in a very efficient fashion. So that's what I'm going to say about my active recall preaching I've been doing that a lot over the last three years and you know how to don it for a while so you know that was a preach mode let's now talk about the second thing that I love to preach about all the time and that is space repetition. Now space repetition it basically helps us counteract the forgetting curve. Now the forgetting curve is something that was discovered by a chap called Ebing House in the 1800s and he discovered that if you learn anything the memory for that thing will just decay exponentially over time which is why we get the phenomenon that you know when we learn something and we come back to it a week later we realise we've forgotten all of it and sometimes we think that oh damn you know I must be stupid because all my friends can retain the stuff but why can't I and actually all of our friends have that problem as well we like it's an innate part of how memory works that you would just forget stuff that you don't revisit. So the idea behind space repetition is that you want to repeat the the topic at space intervals over time to interrupt the forgetting curve. So let's say you would do a topic on day one and then you would do it again the next day great now you've interrupted the forgetting curve but because you've interrupted it actually takes you longer to forget it so then you do the topic a week later and again you've interrupted the forgetting curve and then let's just let's say you do it a month later and by spacing the repetitions of that topic over time we end up basically getting the topic into a long-term memory. Now I've got a video that basically talks about the method that I use for doing this I think I released this video in 2019 before I discovered notion and prior to that point I was using Google Sheets for this method so I had a spreadsheet how it works is that I've got a list of topics down one bit of the spreadsheet and then I'm writing down the dates for whenever I'm repeating the topic and now I basically do this on notion because it lets me have everything on one place. So for example the topic of nerves I called this the retrospective revision timetable so the topic of nerves I first did you know repetition one on the first of January and then I repeated it again on the seventh of January and then again on the 20th of February so it was one week in between these repetitions and then like a whole month and a bit in between these two repetitions but the point is I'm keeping track of when I'm repeating the topic. Equally muscles I did first on the first of January then on the eighth of January and then 21st of Feb third of Jan 10th of Jan 24th Feb I'm keeping track of how often I've repeated this and the idea is that when you know let's say today it's the 25th of February let's say today I know I want to study human physiology I will look at my retrospective revision timetable and I will think okay what is the topic that makes sense for me to do today so for example renal I've only done once in total that's all about the kidneys and I did that only 18th of February so I'd probably be doing that today 25th of Feb and maybe if I had time I'd possibly repeat respiratory another important thing with this is that in brackets I'm rating how difficult I found the topic or rather how well I knew the topic after kind of going over it so for example the first time I did nerves on the first of January I rated it a two out of five which means I wasn't really good at it but then the next time I did it a week later I rated it a four out of five and then when I did it a month later I rated it five out of five which means I know the topic almost back to front and if I'm like 30 hundred percent confident am I rate six out of five just to let myself know how well I knew the topic and that means let's say there's a topic here you know let's say actually respiratory was a one let's say I don't didn't know anything about respiratory medicine now this is really useful information for me to have because now it's a 25th of February and I can decide that actually maybe my time's better spent repeating respiratory medicine because it was only one out of five a week ago so why don't I do that today maybe on top of renal or maybe instead of renal and the idea is that over time we're keeping track of how difficult we found these topics so we can build our space repetition intervals from that there are a lot of people that prefer to create their own study time table and you can absolutely do that on notion notion is amazing it's got like tables and graphs and you know can bandboards you see so you can make a revision time table that looks forward a prospective revision time table as I said in another video which I'll link up there somewhere I'm just not a fan of this method because it involves way too much guesswork you know how will I know two months from now what my day is going to look like and therefore which three topics I should study instead I prefer to do it this way where on any given day I can just take a glance at my revision time table and I can decide okay what is the topic that I need to most do keeping in mind the principle of space repetition and keeping in mind the idea that I should probably be tackling the the subjects that I'm least comfortable with because what's the point of revising nerves again that I'm a five out of five on I should really spend my time studying something that number two out of five on for example and one of the nice things about notion that I was going about it's just it's just kind of a pleasure to use so let's say you know you want to be a little bit fancy you don't want to do two out of five you can actually just use emojis so if I you know I could just do it two stars so you could do a star and just copy and paste it that could be two stars you know this could be four stars and this could be five stars and then one I'm looking at this just like oh it's just kind of nice alternative that you can use like a traffic like system like system emojis so let's say that was a one and I can use a red little dot thing that was a three so let's call it yellow I'm finding the yellow emoji and that was a four so let's call it I'm going to green and I'm finding a green emoji I think it was kind of used whatever emojis you want and that's one of the one of the sort of pleasurable parts of using notion that the emojis just add a little bit of spice to it and make more interesting to use so yeah you can kind of do what you want but the idea is that with this method you are encouraging yourself to use space repetition and tracking how difficult you found each topic so that over time and on a given day you can decide what topic you want to focus on and finally I just want to talk a little bit about organizing like your notion is really helpful for just like organizing everything I'm not really a student anymore so I teach physiology and I use notion to help kind of organize my lectures around that but I don't really have classes to go to or assignments to do as such and so I don't really find a use of it in that sense but I've seen loads of people's notion setups over the last few months like almost any time someone meets me like on the streets or like you know at a conference or I was ever vidcon over the weekend and like three different people came up to me and said oh I started using notion because of your videos and I was like great can you show over your setup and you know they were like showing me their setups and like like you know here's here's how I'm tracking my homework assignments here I'm here's how I'm tracking my essays here's how I'm using notions to track my dissertation there's all sorts of organizational techniques you can use in that and the nice thing about notion is that there is this whole library of templates that the notion staff but also that members of the community have made that you can just copy and I'll put link in the video description you can just kind of have a look through the sorts of ways in which other people are using notion and you can basically duplicate those templates and do your own thing but I'll show you the the way that I use notion is that I use to keep track of my students so here are some of the students that I've been teaching I've got 10 students that I teach you usually on a Thursday night Harry Ron Hermione, Ginny Neville, Luna, Sheamus Dean, Provorty and Show and occasionally I'll set them certain essays to do so I've actually got a whole bank of essays that I've taken from previous past papers for example you know describe the roles of sodium channels and the sodium pump and electrical activity of no fibers and I've linked that to the topic of nerves and that is like an actual link within the database and that's another really cool thing about notion that you can have these links between the databases so for example if I were to click on nerves it would take me to this nurse topic and the really cool thing about this is that when I'm on the nerves topic it shows me all of the related essays because the the essays database and the subjects databases linked so it shows me at a glance what all the different essays are within nerves that I've been tagged with nerves so you know all the nothing behavior initiation form and proper propagation of active action potentials all of this sort of stuff and so I've got some nerve essays some of the essays fit you know both nerves and muscles so I've tagged them with both so they appear in both so if I click on muscles for example you know you'll see all of the essays there's nine of them in total associated with muscles equally cardio respiratory, renal, endocrine etc etc but crucially I can also see which of the students I've assigned these essays to so let's say it goes to the end of the term and I need to write an end of term report for one of my students and let's say I'll go and run I can click on run and then you know notion is created like runs on profile and within that it tells me all of the different essays that run is done how is the strength of contraction regulation different types of muscles to what extent homie static mechanism and it's Baytree how does the body respond to an ascent to high altitude all interesting things so I can see what essays runs done and you know if I still got the physical copies or if I've got the word documents or whatever I can drag them up just to remind myself and I can also add kind of extra elements to this so for example in sort of the middle of michael misturm first term of university runs score in the exam was 80 percent in the multiple choice and the first class essay which is very good and let's say we were doing you know seconds term mock exam I could just make a property for that and then run score might be 95 percent or whatever so essentially like with notion I could just add whatever I need to to organize my life and I use that to help organize my students and keep track of what essays they're doing but if you're an actual student then obviously you can use the user to keep track of your assignments you're notes or whatever and so that's basically how I use notion to take notes in medical school I've seen so many people now who use notion for the same thing and everyone says oh my god notion has changed my life since I started using it for note taking so if you've gone to this point in the video then you're in luck because the kind people at notion who are very kindly sponsoring this video they've given us a thousand codes to upgrade your free notion account into a free personal account now the free notion account is easy to get started with because it gives you a thousand free blocks and blocks are like you know each of these lines is a block and each of these pages is a block and within each page like every sort of like block of content is a block a thousand blocks is pretty good to get started with and kind of play around with notion but really if you're using it for any kind of thing long term you will need to upgrade to the personal plan and the personal plan is four dollars a month or five dollars a month depending on whether you play it pay annually or monthly but if you watch this video on your at this point please do hit you know the thumbs up for the youtube algorithm as they say but also you can use a special code and that will be on screen and there's going to be instructions on screen here somewhere and maybe also in the video description about how you can upgrade your notion account into a free personal account for life or at least for a year I don't know how long it's for but it's like for a long time so that you don't have to pay for notion so actually if you're a student and you've got a dot ac or dot edu email address anyway you can just get a free personal account just anyway because notion is free for students to use so if you use the right email address you can just upgrade your account to a personal account for free but let's say you're a student from a different country where you don't have dot edu or dot ac emails or you know you're not a student you just want notion for free and don't want to pay the four dollars a month or whatever you know even though this sponsored my videos I still pay for notion I'm not yet on a free personal package but because of the very kind we've got a thousand of those so the first thousand people to visit that and put in that coupon code we'll get notion for free the personal plan it's great definitely check it out um before stopping this I just want to show you like one of the thing and that is uh this is something that I sort of always tell my students and tell them at the start of the term these are sort of the priorities as far as I'm considering for teaching them like priority number one to stay healthy because you know there's no other higher priority then kind of managing physical and mental health especially when we're at university and this kind of like really intense environment probably number two as far as I'm concerned is that you know they should preferably pass the exam because failing an exam if there's no exciting certain circumstances is usually a recipe for a lot of misery further down the line and if you can just pass the exam then life just becomes a lot easier then point number three understand physiology enjoy physiology enjoy the university experience enjoy the degree and the final priorities sort of right at the bottom of the list is to get a first class and so the thing that I tell my students is as far as I'm concerned all of these the all of these six things rank way higher than getting a first class degree or doing really well in the exams as long as they pass and at that point I'd much rather they enjoy the subject and enjoy the degree and enjoy the university experience then they kind of kill themselves trying to compete against you know the rest of the people in the year to try and get amazing exam results so just a little snippet of life advice that I sometimes offer my students for whatever it's worth so yeah that's it thanks for watching that was how to take notes of notion in medical school links here to more of my notion themed videos I think like in 2017 or 2018 I became known as like the iPad Pro guy but now when people stop me on the streets I seem to become known as the notion guy which is great because I love notion and use it absolutely thanks for watching see you in the next video bye bye
