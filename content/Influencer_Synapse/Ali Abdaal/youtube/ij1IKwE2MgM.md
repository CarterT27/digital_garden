## Transcript
 Hey guys, welcome back to the channel. If you're new here at my name is Ali, I'm a junior doctor working in Cambridge and this is going to be the final video in the WWDC recap series And in this video, I'm going to be indulging my love of all things that pulled by focusing on the funny bits and the banterous bits that were included in it As usual, there's going to be timestamps in the video description and in a pinned comment so you can skip around the video if you feel like it and you can even replay some of your favorite moments of banter, but now let's just get into So the event starts off fairly uneventfully with our boy Tim talking about TVOS and Apple Music and then he invites our friend Kevin to this day to talk about Apple Watch and this is where we get the first piece of banter from the keynote Our, you'll feel a silent tactic on your wrist. It if sound is on, you'll hear an audible chime like this Yes, that's a bird song It's actually a Robin captured an apple park. I mean, it was recorded an apple park The robins are okay No, no Kevin, mate. I don't know how you do it. That was an absolute cook or a lie. That maybe burst that laughing when I When I first heard it, so then Kevin talks a bit more about the Apple Watch and then we get a fellow medical doctor, Dr. Symbal Desi, talking about the health features of the Apple Watch Hearing loss is often so gradual. It's important to know when the sounds around you were loud enough to impact your hearing Like when you're in the middle of a construction zone at a sporting event or playing your music early loud to drown out your singing voice I do that all the time I mean, yeah, fair play to her. I think that got a few laughs from the audience. I'm actually very jealous of her career So she started off as a computer science undergraduate and then after a few years she went to medical school at Stanford And then she became the executive director of Stanford Medicine Center for Digital Health and then she was Snapped up by Apple as their VP of health. So that's a pretty cool career. Things crossed one day. We'll see The next piece of attempted banter comes from Haley Allen who's the Watch OS program lead Remind Marcus that just because you're almost seven does not mean you get to quote veto your bedtime Yeah, fair enough. I got a few chocolates from the parents in the audience who have seven year old children So they talk about the Apple Watch a bit more and then Tim Cook comes back on stage to introduce Craig who is everyone's favorite Apple presenter or Craig as the Americans would pronounce it. I'd like to hand it over to Craig Craig Now when it came to naming this release our crack marketing team the really surprised us this year by demonstrating their ability to count well into the double digits Yes, it's iOS 13 So I've been watching the Apple keynote for the last few years ever since I became an Apple fanboy and pretty much everyone on the internet agrees that Craig's presentations Within Apple are probably the funniest and he loves to poke fun at the marketing department and playing to those stereotypes Probably a little bit problematic in 2019, but I think I think he does it to a good level over here and you're calendar Your daily events never looked so awesome. This is really beautiful Ah, that's a Craig banter am I right anyway Craig then introduces the team behind the iOS dog mode feature happy times And did slowly begin They're descent into darkness We take the details very seriously Yeah, that's a pretty good touch and it seemed like everyone in the audience appreciated that then they talk a bit about Apple maps Which no one cares about and a few security privacy features that some people care about and then Craig thankfully comes back on stage to talk about messages I received messages like this like who is this guy? Well, wouldn't it be better if you could see something like this or maybe even This So he talks about these new messaging features and then we get this very weird interlude from two beauty youtubers that honestly I've never heard of before Probably because I'm not a beauty youtuber and they're using the new memoji feature to talk to each other It's a little bit weird and I think everyone in the audience kind of agrees that it's a little bit weird But then thankfully Craig comes back on stage and addresses the awkwardness in the room So I think that's given us all a great deal to think about Now and then Craig comes back on to talk about iPadOS and while he's demoing the split screen features he drops this fantastic line So in addition to notes here and pages I can have two Microsoft Word documents side by side I mean that's inappropriate right there So I actually laughed out loud the first time I saw that and there's a running joke amongst developers slash coders about enterprise software enterprise apps An enterprise apps are seen as being these like big bloated pieces of software that were made decades ago That enterprises are a big companies pay obscene amounts of money for and when you hear enterprise software You tend to think of Microsoft or like Oracle or Salesforce So these like big companies that are making very very expensive pieces of software that are used by these massive companies So here Craig is kind of giving a nod to that culture of making fun of enterprise and to pricey stuff By saying that two Microsoft Word Windows or oh that's enterprise And that sounds a lot less funny now that I've tried to explain the joke. I probably didn't even do a very good job of explaining it But anyway, then they talk about the new Mac Pro and the produce play XDR There's not a lot of band from those presentations until unintentionally right at the end when when the guy announces the price of the stand Abuse amount of effort of the 199 and the first and 99 and like the Mac Pro, they'll all be available in the fall So as soon as the announces that the stand is going to cost a thousand dollars You can hear the the outrage in the audience when everyone is kind of like muttering amongst themselves And then he kind of flounders a little bit in his presentation I think he might have been expecting some level of applause But instead he's got these people in the audience being like what the hell how an earth can you charge us a thousand dollars for a monitor stand Thankfully the awkwardness about hashtag stand gate. I think that's what we should call it is rescued by Craig again when he comes back on and delivers some chat about iTunes Well now customers love iTunes and everything it can do, but if there's one thing we hear over and over It's can iTunes do even more I think it can how about calendar in iTunes I mean you can have all of your appointments and your best tracks right in one app Could we take it further? I think so how about mail in iTunes and maybe Safari in iTunes And how are you going to switch between these apps full of course you'll add a doc I think we've nailed it I thought this segment was pretty great because Craig is poking fun at Apple at themselves for how bad iTunes is Like it's been a frustration for pretty much anyone using macOS that iTunes is absolutely terrible It tries to do too many things it's far too bloated and it's good that they're not taking themselves too seriously But they're able to kind of laugh at themselves before you know announcing that they're actually going to split it up into three different apps Which is met with a round of applause from everyone in the room although in fairness almost everything they say and this keynote is met with a round of applause So maybe that's not quite a prognostic factor for how good a feature is now when you plug in your phone This is what you see Nothing And again he's doing the classic Craig thing of poking fun at Apple while also announcing a new feature So then for the next 30 minutes they talk about changes for developers the things like swift and augmented reality And then for some very odd reason they invite two people who from the from the Minecraft team to come and demo the augmented reality version of Minecraft Which is very very weird and sort of like killing chickens and staff and it's a little bit awkward But then Craig comes back on and tries to add a little joke to the mix Yeah, just to be clear no chickens were harmed on stage WPC I know it was very life like but that was that was an illusion Yeah, fair enough. That's an easy shot to take and it seemed like the people in the audience appreciate to that And finally they ended the keynote by talking about this new thing called SwiftUI Which is a feature for developers that makes it a lot easier to actually build apps That's better, but we all know that product marketing chooses these names randomly So to get a feel that matches the reality Let's wrap our banner in a custom randomizer component that I built earlier to help us pick a name And now we're ready to choose the next name for macOS No, it's not great. Let's try one more Cute animals seems promising Well that one's perfect All right, so because SwiftUI includes built in support for integrating with other Apple frameworks I've got to be fun to use the new reality kit framework to envision the release of macOS 10 flying squirrel And it looks like it's going to be amazing And that's a quick look at pulling his inner faces with you And that's good for you So yeah, that obviously goes down really well amongst this audience of developers Because it actually is genuinely like an incredible feature that you can do all these new things with SwiftUI And it's kind of cool how instead of going with like some lame example they went for a fun example Which you might actually consider to be lame, but you know I quite enjoyed it People in the audience enjoyed it Yeah, so that was a highlight reel of Apple's WWDC focusing on the jokes The funiness, the banter that was at the event rather than the products themselves But you know there's loads of videos on the internet And I've done one myself where I talk about my top five highlights from WWDC And another one where I talk about my favorite new features coming to iPad OS Big shout out to Craig Federigi for being the most entertaining Apple presenter as usual I think maybe over half of the funny bits of this keynote came from him But I think the joke of the event has to go to the guy Kevin right at the start who made that joke about the Robin and heo that is again Our you'll feel a silent topic on your wrist It if sound is on you'll hear an audible chime like this Yes, that's a bird song It's actually a Robin captured an apple park I mean it was recorded an apple park The robins are okay Alright So thank you so much for watching this video I hope you found it vaguely entertaining I certainly enjoyed making it while I was watching the keynote I had this idea that oh you know there's some bits of this that I genuinely quite funny So why don't I just make a video talking about the funny bits because you know Who wants to just talk about tech all the time But yeah from from next week we're going to be returning to our regularly scheduled programming Where I make videos about medicine tech education productivity That's sort of stuff So more stuff coming soon if you like the video please give it a thumbs up If you haven't subscribed to the channel then please consider doing so have a lovely day And I'll see you in the next video. Goodbye
