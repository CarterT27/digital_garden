## Transcript
 All right, so obviously there's a lot that goes into financial success like luck and privilege and unfair advantages But because one of our goals on this channel is to help you get to financial freedom and because it makes for a nice click-back title in this video I'm gonna go over eight habits that have helped me become a millionaire. Let's go for it All right, habit number one is more of a mindset shift really and that is that those people don't become millionaires or achieve large amount of financial success through their day job. Usually if you want to acquire wealth in a short amount of time You have to a have multiple streams of income and b have streams of income that do not rely on you trading your time for money I first came across this idea in Tim Ferriss's fantastic book the four-hour workweek Which is really all about how to build these multiple streams of income in a way that doesn't take over your life and Since about the age of 17 when I started looking at the world in this way and thinking that okay I need to not be reliant on my day job to make money and need to make money through multiple streams of income That habit that mindset change allowed me to see lots of different opportunities in the world that I might not have seen otherwise habit number two I call a strategic laziness and this firstly relies on us recognizing the value of our own time Time is the most valuable non-renewable resource. It's the only thing we can't make more of we can always make more money But we can never make more time and that's why again since I discovered this book and came across this idea I've been trying to do whatever I can to optimize my time as much as possible And I call this strategic laziness, right because a lot of the time There are things that we can do to automate Processes that we do fairly regularly things that we can do to speed up will be more productive in our tasks So people see me as someone who's like completely obsessed with productivity That's possibly true to some extent But the reason that I love productivity so much is because it ultimately helps me save time And so if there is an app or an automation or a macro that I can set up on my computer that makes doing a repeated task more efficient Then I'll put in the investment of time to set that up because I know it's gonna save me time further down the line The other way in which I use strategic laziness is to really ask like What is the point of this thing that I'm trying to do? You know as it was going through university as it was going through school as I've been setting up my businesses I always have in my mind what is the outcome that I want and for example in my first year of medical school I wasn't thinking like this. I was thinking hey, I need to learn all of medicine because that's what makes me better doctor And I realize that that's actually a not what the exam is about and be being a good doctor is not about just learning the entire textbook And so the way I was approaching my school was in a very kind of heavy lift kind of fashion I thought it had to be like really really hard to learn the textbook But then from my second year onwards for the next five years I really asked myself Okay, how do I be strategically lazy about this? How do I make sure the stuff that I'm doing is the most efficient way of getting to my goal of abing a good doctor hopefully and be doing well in the exams And I think you can apply this habit and this general principle to everything across business You know often when someone starts up a business for the first time and I was guilty of this myself We spend absolutely ages making a website and making a business card and making sure the logo is legit and spending hundreds of hours on this pointless stuff Whereas if we're being strategically lazy we recognize the end goal is to get customers and to sell them something and so You know fancy website logo business card It really doesn't help with that particular end goal habit number three is to develop an entrepreneurial diagnostic mindset That is the sort of thing that like if you're interested in starting our businesses Which you probably want to be because that's the well easiest and quickest way to get wealthy very quickly in this day and age Again, it's not gonna be through your job But if you're interested in the idea of setting up businesses you need to have a decent idea for what business to sell up and The thing that dictates whether something is a good business idea is number one Identifying a problem that people have and number two figuring out a way to solve the problem and three Ideally people will want to pay you money for the solution and so the habit here is that as you're going out into the world and going about your day-to-day life You want to be recognizing whenever you notice that something really sucks or that there is a specific problem Like for example, if at one point you thought, oh, it really sucks that to order a takeaway I have to phone up a restaurant. I wish there were a better way to do it That might give you the idea for something like door-to-short deliver rule or just eat in the UK if you had the idea That ordering a taxi like really sucks like why don't have to phone up this company and be on hold for five minutes That might have given you the idea to start something like Uber or Lyft and the more you approach life with this entrepreneurial mindset You start seeing these ideas and absolutely everything and I get so many emails from people being like Hey, I want to make money, but I don't have a good business idea And the reason you don't have a good business idea is because you're not looking at the world from this lens of what are the problems? What really sucks out there in the world and therefore? What are the problems that I can create solutions for? habit number four is the growth mindset which you might have come across and the way I like to think of this is that everything is Figure outable often the non- Entrepreneurial-minded people will think about doing something like I don't know starting a YouTube channel and think oh I don't know how to do that that feels quite hard and it will stop them there Whereas the more entrepreneurial people will have an idea for I want to make this business with this app or this YouTube channel and instead of thinking I don't know how to do it there for I can't they'll be thinking I don't know how to do it But that's fine because I've got the internet and I can figure it out everything in the world is figure outable Stuff feels like much more of a black box than it actually is if you've ever thought about doing something But you've been stopped by this idea of I don't know how to do it then the everything is figure outable Approach is a great habit to adopt which is that your default is to Google something and figure it out Because literally everything on earth is available in the internet and you can teach yourself any skill that you want to That bring this on to habit number five which is that although everything is a skill and everything can be learned and you can Google Absolutely anything you want there is a point out which you can accelerate the process of learning or doing anything by asking the right people And there's a great book by Ben Hardy and Dan Sullivan called who not how which kind of embodies this approach when it comes to business Like when you have a problem you want to think who can help me solve this problem Rather than necessarily how can I solve this problem by myself If you're young and you're just getting started out in business and you don't know many people Then you kind of do have to do things by yourself and it makes a lot sense like you can figure out how to fit your edit or podcast edit or make a website or learn to code or any of these things For free using the internet, but when you get to the point where you have a certain amount of success or if you know people who are Interested into this business thing as well You can really start adopting the who not how habit which will really help you accelerate your results because now you're taking advantage of your network For example with me a few months ago, I started out in initiative called the part-time youtuber academy Which is a live online course that I've been teaching for two live cohorts now and Like you know, I was reading the book who not how at that time and I really thought okay I could try and figure this out by myself But instead I'm gonna reach out to friends that I've made on Twitter or people a part of my network and ask them how they've done the same thing and This like massively accelerated our learning curve for the part-time youtuber academy It made it into like you know our first launch was like 300,000 dollars a second launch was like 500,000 dollars It made like a stupidly insane amount of money and it got really really good reviews and I think a big part of that was that we got the right people Involved rather than me and my team trying to think hey, let's do everything ourselves Then bring this on to habit number six, which is to make friends with people in real life and more importantly I'm not more importantly, but but additionally on the internet and the single best way I find for doing this is Twitter Twitter is an incredible incredible incredible invention that you can use to make friends with people all around the world and Then I think about Twitter is that it's it's different to Instagram Instagram is very sort of visual and based on posting pretty pictures But Twitter is very much based on sharing good ideas and if you're sharing interesting ideas and you're connecting with other people who are sharing those similar ideas That automatically leads you to kind of becoming internet friends and then they follow you You followed them you chat a little bit in the DMs and over the last year I've met up with so many people who I initially met on Twitter and I've got friends all around the world who have never ever met in real life But we've talked on Twitter. We know we like the same stuff. We share the same ideas and these like a this just makes life much more fun But if we're talking about habits to get to becoming a millionaire I can point to lots of these different connections that are really accelerated to the growth of my business For example me and my mate Thomas Frank became friends on Twitter at like two weeks ago Thomas Frank then introduced me to standard, which is the YouTube urgency that I'm now part of and that completely changed the game for my business Secondly, there's two chaps Tiago 40 and David Perrell who run their own online courses We became friends on Twitter after I took their courses and started engaging with them on Twitter And then I DMed them when I wanted help for my own part on YouTube or Academy and they really helped with that and again That really accelerated the growth of the business to becoming a two million dollar business and when it comes to this making friends thing like it's It's one of those things that's very hard to like if you make friends with someone then it will lead to this It's more like you have this general habit this general attitude towards making friends with Whoever shares the same ideas that you and just generally trying to be a nice and helpful person and you know that eventually That lead to really interesting things happening in your life further down the line on a somewhat related note Habit number seven is reading a lot and just like we can get wisdom from our real life and our internet friends via Twitter We can get a lot more wisdom from people who have written books about stuff You know like if you speak to any One who's like successful in almost anyway, they will they will almost always say that They read a lot of books and they will also almost always say that every One else that they know who's successful also reads a lot of books So if you're telling yourself, I don't have time to read then you're kind of Scoring yourself because you know Basically every minute in our your ask will have spent tons and tons of time reading books And again the great thing about books is that you've got like you know five ten twenty years of Experience that someone has boiled down to a thing that takes you a few hours to read like Tim Ferriss was doing the Entrepreneur thing for like ten years before he wrote the book That's pretty sick that's ten years of wisdom that you can read in a few hours and If you read lots of books of this or entrepreneurship like business finance like any Basically anything you're interested in you can just get a huge amount of value from them And it doesn't really cost very much you can find PDFs on the internet for free if you're really a Verse to paying for books if that's if that's your vibe and it's just like such a great way to accelerate You're learning and almost anything if you didn't know I am also writing a book Which is probably gonna come out in two years time But I'll put a link to my book mailing list news that's a which is like I wear a share my book journey and what it's like to write and research a book and So I'm put chapters and getting the order into the opinion and stuff so that'll be linked in the video description If you want to check it out and finally habit number eight for becoming a millionaire is to acquire financial literacy Now this is one of those things that Like no one teaches us in school or university or college But it's just one of those things that you have to learn for yourself and you can get it through reading books such as for example This book Not crap the psychology of money by Morgan Housel which is now a little bit dilapidated I read this recently. It's really really really good 20 bite sized lessons about money Gonna make a video about that But also just like generally taking taking your financial life into your own hands and there's so many people who have sort of relegated their financial life to you know Oh, it's just something that the government will sort out or you know my hospital will figure out what taxes I need to pay and then I'll just kind of do it from there You know this like money is such an important part of life It's one of the biggest sources of stress in anyone's life if you don't have much of it and so much of a life It's been in the pursuit of money and financial freedom financial independence That if we don't have financial literacy if we don't understand the basics of saving or investing or how the stock market works So how taxes work and you've that kind of stuff again? We are just screwing ourselves because if you want to become a millionaire you have to have Some level of financial literacy to know what it takes to become a millionaire and how that might actually work So I recommend reading a book like the psychology of money by Morgan Housel or if you like you can check out this video over here Which is my ultimate guide to investing in stocks and shares That's like a half an hour long crash course on everything you need to know about investing if you don't know about Investing definitely check out that video. Thank you so much for watching. I hope you found this video useful and I'll see you in the next one. Bye
