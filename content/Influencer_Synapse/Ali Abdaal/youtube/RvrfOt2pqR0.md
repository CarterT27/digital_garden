 Hinge. Do I want to show you my edge profile? I'll show you my edge profile. Tinder and Bumble. Fairly similar. How's my profile and Tinder and Bumble? Let's not see anyone else. Okay, I have a junior doctor just to get the hang of things. I spend most of my evenings making YouTube videos and singing Ed Sheeran Baggers. Hey friends, welcome back to the channel. It is that time of the year. We are doing the classic What's on my iPhone? My favorite iPhone apps, genre, esk, type of video. I'm just going to go through them in order because I've kind of got them in a specific order and I'll skip over the boring stuff like Facebook, Messenger and Instagram because everyone knows what they do but I'll talk about some of the more interesting apps that I've maybe discovered this year or that I've been using in a particularly interesting way in my opinion. So maybe you'll get some ideas about apps that you can install onto your iPhone or Android phone if you're one of those heathens but seem to be watching this video for some reason. Anyway, let's go for it. So first of all, oh by the way, everything like timestamps, video description, pinned comment all around so you can skip to things that you want to see if you really want to I don't feel like you have to watch this whole video because I have no idea how long I'm going to go on for. Anyway, number one, fantastical is my calendar app. It's not particularly interesting. It's kind of expensive for a calendar app. The main reason I like it is because it's got some pretty decent natural language processing which means if I were to write for example. First date with Jane, 10pm at Fitzbilly's, it would recognize like all of the various bits of that so it would understand the location, understand the time and it's quite a nice way of dealing with with events. I don't have a first date with Jane, I wish. Next we have the app drafts and this is something that I've newly discovered this year a few months ago and I've been using it practically daily ever since and the idea behind draft is that it's a very quick and easy note taking app. So you hit the draft spot and it opens up a new note automatically, no having to fath around with the new note button and then you can pretty much type whatever you want and then that becomes a draft and so then you've got your inbox list of various drafts that you can have on here and usually I keep this as a sort of short-term memory ram random access memory type thing. So if throughout the day I'm having any kind of thought that I need to write down. So if it's an idea for a podcast or an idea for a video or just an idea of something in life or even like a little to-do list then often the easiest thing to do is just open up drafts on my iPhone and then I'll write it down there. Firstly let's talk about notion notions probably my favorite app of the year that I discovered and I use notion for a ton of stuff. I will link two of my other notion videos in the video description. One of them is like an introduction to notion and how it works specifically aimed at students and the second is about how I use notion as a resonance calendar. So if you haven't seen that one I basically make a list of everything that's every kind of content that I've consumed although that sounds really weird content consumption. Any kind of content that I've consumed like books, podcasts, videos, whatever that I've that has resonated with me in some way goes into my resonance calendar. So recently there was this water towers piece by Seth Goden and when you add it to notion it automatically like brings the article in for you and leaves you a link to the article recently as well. Oh there was this fantastic article by Paul Graham called the lesson to unlearn and it's got a link to that and I need to take some notes on it. So essentially anytime I come across something cool it goes into the resonance calendar. I also need to use a notion for a ton of other things so I use it as the idea of refinery for my various bits of content that I create. So I've got like this massive vast inbox of all the ideas that I'm currently working on that I've come across from various bits and then those might turn into ideas and then drafts and then email and newsletters. If you want to check out my email newsletter again to link in the video description and then once it's published it goes into the published category, I also use notion to keep track of all my various videos and video ideas that I've got upcoming sponsored videos, random video ideas. Essentially I use notion to track my entire life and I'll be making loads of more videos about notion throughout the next few months because I've just got like 10 different use cases for it and every month also I'm discovering new ways in which I can add notion to my life. So yeah probably my favorite app of the year. Anything else that I want to draw your attention to? Oh this is kind of cool. I have like this private life OS thing whereby I've started doing this thing where I have like a daily highlight of the day and this was like a productivity tip that I picked up from the book Make Time which I'll link over here some way and it talks about how it's important to have like a single highlight that you want to accomplish that day because you know the whole point of productivity is that we're doing the things that we actually want to do and not wasting time on the stuff that we don't want to do and so for example here my heart out of the day was filmed brilliant video and to notion office hours at 6pm so I kind of cheated and had to there but you know I just like to write down the one thing that I'm working on today so for example here what is this? notion video what's on my iPhone Skillshare video study with me voiceover that I've already done and I just got a few different things that I want to work on so I kind of I've I've I'm trying to build a habit where I kind of check into my daily highlight thing I haven't been doing for the last 10 days because I've been on holiday and I feel it's fair enough to not have you know a productivity mindset or intated goal when you're on holiday in Japan. Anyway yeah that's what I use notion for basically organizing my entire life. By the way thank you notion for sponsoring this video if you didn't see the little message that appeared at the start just for disclosure. Next we've got to do is which is my to do list app I use notion for most like project management he kind of thing so things that require my attention over a period of time but I use to do as to things like call nonny who's my grandmother and water the plants and sort of home insurance and hip na therapy and you know send my bill company and electric meter reading so things like that also if I ever need to make a shopping list for going to same sprees or whatever then I'll put it into to do it and I've sort of got different categories of different things like I've got this weekly reminder to publish the weekly podcast and publish my email newsletter which repeats every Sunday so I try and check to do this once a day just to make sure that I'm on top of the medial tasks that I need to be doing not saying they call it my grandma is a medial task but I think you know it's nice to have that reminder every other day that I should probably call my grandma. The podcast play of choice is Castro and initially I was using overcast for several years but then I switched to Castro because the nice thing about Castro is that it's got this really good library and inbox feature so I listen to a ton of podcast far too many to keep up with really but what Castro does is that it gives you like an inbox it's been a while since I've been through this inbox but it gives you an inbox and you can decide based on the titles of that podcast colors infuriate where do you see yourself in five years let's add that to my queue and you can add it to the top of your queue or to the bottom of your queue so that's add that to the bottom because then it'll come up after I've listened to the stuff I wanted this into already become the leader you would want to follow ignore how to resolve conflict like a martial artist don't care the morals philosophy of the good place don't care affiliate finding positive feedback loop so essentially I can go through all of the episodes that have come up in the podcast that I care about and then just sort of get rid of the ones I don't care about or add add the ones that interest me to the top of my queue or to the bottom of my queue and this is currently what my queue looks like so we've got this Ben Horowitz interview in Tim Ferris that I'm listening to at the moment a few episodes of Bulletproof Radio this episode of the alternative CV which is run by a friend of mine know a Kagan loads of episodes of the show which is one of his new podcasts but each episode is only like a minute long so you know that seems quite intimidating it's not really so yeah that's my podcast app of choice next we have Audible of course Audible best source for audiobooks I've just finished listening to the Dragon Reborn by Robert Jordan so I need to buy another one on there and I don't know I've I've actually been listening to Audible so much was it this month total in total in my life although I think that's just since I installed this phone perhaps in my life I've listened to 13 days and 15 hours of audiobooks and on average I'm listening to about one or two hours each day because I commute an hour to work and an hour back from work and so I usually listen to Audible on the middle of the car next we have Evernote which I still sort of sometimes kind of use so I use Evernote as the sort of long-term memory of my second brain I'll link a few articles down below that talk about this in a bit more detail and I'll be doing some more videos later on but essentially I've got like notebooks for all of the various things that I care about so what is it book club book publishing and building a second brain business content creation creativity decision making digital no matter your marketing entrepreneurship essays find cabinet getting things done happiness interesting life learning life advice management memory money online course patreon personal finance picky pk and personal knowledge management put cost notes productivity all of this sort of stuff and the idea is that when I come across stuff I put it into notion if it's like a resonance calendar piece and if I'm taking notes on it then I'll put it into Evernote so that if I'm I don't know writing something about how to study effectively for exams I can look at my where's my where's my studying thing oh yeah I can look through my notes for studying and I can find bits that I've aggregated over time from various different sources so that's what I use Evernote 4 then we have Lightroom which is the app that I used to edit photos so here are some examples so I edited recently this is a little before and after you can see if I yeah before after oh this one this was a picture from work so before what before and after before and after and I tend to use this Lightroom presets and a few other random edits to edit photos for my Instagram page so you can follow me of Instagram if you aren't already scan a bull's not very interesting and use it to scan staff and put it into Evernote day one is interesting oh hello so it's essentially a journaling app so I've got like a journal that I'm not going to show you I have a nice comments folder where I screen shot nice comments that I've gotten from like YouTube and Instagram and I put it into this journal so that if I'm feeling sad about life I can just kind of look through my nice comments journal and that acts as a little pick me up bear I used to use a lot before I discovered drafts so I still sometimes use bear for like long form writing for example if I'm taking notes on a book like these were some notes I was taking on a cardiovascular physiology textbook while I was on an airplane so I couldn't really use notion because it doesn't have offline features or if I'm writing features of my email newsletter then I tend to write them in bear so this was from the 25th of November 2019 and yeah I just use bear as a sort of long form writing kind of note taking hybrid sort of app but I'm kind of phasing bear out and sort of replacing it with the drafts and notion then we have Spotify of course earlier today I was listening to this Taylor Swift song whatever it's called and then I've got my playlist for various years I'll add my Spotify profile down in the video description as well so if you care about the sort of songs that I listen to this is my playlist for this year I'm being a doctor lots of Ed Sheeran lots of Elton John bit of Westlife bit of Lewis Capaldi classic yeah Spotify love it discord recently started a discord server so yeah we talk that we've got like studying we've got podcasts you've got books you've got productivity again I'll link the discord in right down below if you're into discord and you want to chat and this is just generally where I hang out and yeah it seems it seems actually surprising the active how many people do we have online go away we have 228 people online at the moment and I think in total there are over 3,000 people that are on the server so it's just kind of nice it's a little bit wholesome people sharing book recommendations all that stuff so I've been quite enjoying discord medically is the confidential messaging app that my hospital uses so I'm not going to be sharing you what's in there but it's really ideal because if for example I'm on call then I mark myself as on call for obstetrics on the app and so if anyone else in the hospital needs to get in touch with the doctor on call for obstetrics they would message me via the app directly let's put this on do not disturb. Medivrotize an app that again is a hospital thing to it's like electronic rotor management so I check it every now and then and see oh am I on call today am I on call tomorrow if someone messages me and says hey do you want to come to my birthday party on the 12th of January 2020 I would say sorry let me check my rotor and then I'll open up Medivrotor and it would show me what my rotor is microguide is another hospital kind of app this is where our microbial guidelines are so for example let's say I need to prescribe an antibiotic for sepsis of unknown origin then it would show me what antibiotics I should prescribe and this is this varies depending on which hospital you're in because the different bacteria growing in different hospitals and around the areas have different sensitivities to different types of antibiotics so every hospital has its own like guide and conveniently my hospital has it on an app which is ideal google maps boring and then on the first play it page we've got pocket doctor which is a few more guideline things for medicine the bnf which is the British National Formulari so let's say I can't remember the dose of clinder my sin which is an antibiotic I can type it in here open up plinder my sin and it will tell me with the indications I either reasons why you might give clinder my sin and what doses I should give so I often use this daily to check drug doses induction is again a hospital thing empty calc is quite good it helps you I haven't logged in on here but essentially it helps you calculate various things so in medicine there are hundreds of different scoring systems for different conditions for example let's say you've got a condition called atrial fibrillation there is a scoring system called the chadsvask which is like 10 different criteria that decide whether you should get a blood thinner medication or not and it's annoying to remember all of these criteria off the top of your head so empty calc is a great app for you know that just has all of these different scoring systems and then we've got bmg bread best practice which is another medical thing because it's a medical folder but that has got like official evidence based guidelines for loads of different things so if for example I see a patient who's got I don't know vaginal bleeding due to cervical acropion and I can't remember what all that stuff is I will look up on bmg best practice which would tell me the evidence based guys to how to deal with that particular condition a little bit about the organization so page one is usually it tends to be the apps that I actively want myself to use or just apps that are just very quick access so for example I want myself to use drafts, notion and bear because that is me writing stuff I want myself to use like room because that's posting stuff Instagram I kind of want myself to use discord because it's nice to interact with the yeah the fans as it were but for example I've got things like Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube on page number two so that it just adds that very slight layer of friction that I have to swipe in order to go on Instagram which means I I think if Instagram was on page one of my iPhone I'd be going on it a lot more I don't go on Instagram that much I think partly because it's on page two anyway I'll skip the boring stuff here but reader I think is interesting, reader is my RSS feed aggregator of choice and essentially every blog that I read that I want to be subscribed to I add to my RSS reader so I've categorized all of that by various different categories like better human connection the design, doctor block fans, medical ethics, minimalism let's look at minimalism we've got becoming minimalist the minimalist and then habits so I can kind of search through it like that or what I can do is I can just look at all the various things that I'm on red and I can go through the list and the nice thing about reader is that you can very easily let's say I discover this post from Shopify that no let's say I this post from being why you don't need more time for self care let's say I wanted to read that but I don't have time right now I would be able to immediately add it to InstaPaper which is what I'm going to talk about next and InstaPaper is how I read stuff offline essentially so if I want to read something but I don't want to read it right now I will add it to InstaPaper and then when I'm like on the toilet or on the bus so I'm just kidding I don't take the bus I'm kidding I do take the bus if I'm on the bus or on the toilet or whatever I would I would just go through my InstaPaper and then I'd be able to read stuff it's sort of like pocket I used to use pocket for many years but I switched to InstaPaper because the nice thing about InstaPaper is that when you highlight stuff so here I've highlighted something a headphone investor and writer described the importance of letting go financial security I've highlighted that because it's resonated with me in some way so I added a added this particular article to my residence calendar in Notion but also what I've done is that it automatically sinks with Evernote and this is very exciting so there I've got a folder called Readwise more in that in a moment essentially like what it does is that it synchronizes all of my Kindle highlights and all my InstaPaper highlights into an Evernote note for each individual article so this was an article from wait but why how to pick a career that actually fits you and instead of grabbing the whole article which is like 10,000 words it's just synchronized all of my InstaPaper highlights and now when I want to return to this I will just see my highlights and this is incredibly useful and the service to power this is something called Readwise link down below I don't use the app for it because they're developing the app it's in beta but essentially what Readwise does is that it sort of synchronizes all of your Kindle and InstaPaper highlights and it sends you an email every day with five of those random highlights so it's a good way of revisiting lessons that you might have highlighted when you were reading a book or something okay so that was InstaPaper next we have the Economist which is I don't really read it anymore I should probably just get rid of it because I subscribe to the Economist it's sort of like the financial times sort of it's like a magazine you probably heard of it because I wanted to become more like acquainted with current affairs and the news and stuff and then I read it maybe once and then I never clicked on it since so I'm just going to uninstall the Economist because realistically who got time for that am I right? Let's delete that I need to cancel my subscription for it as well anyway next we have the Kindle app the Kindle app is great because if I want to read something but I don't have my physical Kindle on me then I will just read on the Kindle app and at the moment I'm reading a time of dread which is the first book in the Blood and Bone trilogy by what's the name John Gwinn yeah the first the first quartet which was the faithful in the fallen series was incredible so I finished that and now I'm reading of Blood and Bone which is awesome nice thing about Kindle as well is like a highlight stuff so if I wanted to highlight that I could highlight it and then that would sink behind the scenes why I read wise into my evident notebook but I tend to not to highlight fiction because you know what's the point so far is boring Instagram is boring Messenger is boring Twitter is boring LinkedIn spark post is really it's this Adobe thing that I used to generate all the thumbnails for my videos so you just kind of put an image or a screenshot or something and then you can add text to it and you can add icons to it and it just it helps me get this kind of distinctive thumbnail style which some people say is a little bit girly but I think it looks quite pretty so I don't mind if my thumbnail styles girly but that's kind of what I used to make thumbnails teachable is for online courses so there's a few different online courses that I'm subscribed to like write a passage in building a second brain and the fulfilling part definitely depends on my read that I haven't even started watching so this in theory lets me watch those offline I haven't really used it too much on my phone because I tend to just watch stuff on the computer if I'm actually going through an online course but it's nice having the phone app YouTube's boring YouTube studio is for YouTube creators and it shows you analytics and your comments and stuff tabs is really good because it gives you oh god I've got a airplane model because I don't want anyone to see like messages that are popping up on my phone but essentially tabs are sick because it gives you guitar tabs let's go off the airplane mode it gives you guitar tabs for pretty much any song in the world and so if I decide hey I want to play blank space by Taylor Swift I would just go on this I'll search for blank space by Taylor Swift oh it's already in my favorite list and it would tell me the chords and I'd be able to play on the guitar or the piano and sing along and I can transpose up and now if a particular song is too high or too low for me to sing Facebook is boring hinge do you want to show you my hinge profile? I'll show you my hinge profile. Hinge is like a dating app that's not see anyone else because that would be weird but this is essentially my hinge profile I'd be curious if you've got on this far in this really really long video please critique my hinge profile so this is like my uh my the first picture I see I'm overly competitive about articulate I've said I'm six foot I think I'm actually five eleven but you know a bit of uh being economical with the truth doesn't hurt I'm not really a fan of this picture I think I look really weird junior doctor at University of Cambridge and Muslim liberal awkward um this is a picture of me and my brother at graduation I geek out on Harry Potter trivia this is some uh nephew and niece of mine the key to my heart is a midline stonautomy this is a medical joke that a friend of mine came up with it it's not even me so it's not even showing the line funny uh this is a picture of me in Paris and this is a picture of me playing squash in my jeans because I don't have any kit with me so yeah let me know what you think of my hinge profile and to see although I see it'd be doing well I've got 13 notifications on there which means I think some people are messaging me or I've got a few different matches that I need to work through Tinder and Bumble fairly similar how's my profile and Tinder and Bumble let's not see anyone else okay I have a junior doctor just started to get a hang of things I spend most of my evenings making YouTube videos and singing Ed Sheeran Baggers I think I wrote this ages ago although I haven't actually changed it as to a few pictures of me and my friends on my older Tinder profile again let me know what you think of that Tinder not going so well as hinge and then Bumble again dating up I'm not going to show you my profile that's getting a bit old anyway google drive boring google photos photos skill share online courses sponsored my videos brilliant online courses this sponsored my videos curiosity stream documentaries again this sponsored my videos I like having access to these so that you know it reminds me that they're there and that I can use them and then finance wise you got Coinbase I've lost so much money on Bitcoin so I don't even open that anymore because it makes me depressed to see how little money is in there Barclays Banking Monso for Banking American Express of Banking zero for accounting for my business and my fitness pal I don't know why it's in finance it really shouldn't be in there because I was using that to track calories at one point and then I decided I can be bothered so I stopped using it which is fine and that's kind of all the interesting stuff like on page three four and five and six I've got this random apps and utilities that I use very very occasionally is there anything interesting oh one thing I completely forgot to mention my email app is superhuman and that's this one over here but yeah so it's superhuman is great it does cost thirty dollars a month but yeah it's just the fastest and best email app I use deliverer to order food use just eat occasionally to order food the DJI app or to for controlling my drone you know British Airways or booking.com and stuff and I'm going on holiday but that's pretty much all of the apps on my iPhone um I hope you found something in there that was a vaguely vaguely helpful uh if you've gotten this for either video thank you for watching please do critique my dating profile because I'm still single so I need all the advice and all the help that I can get. Thanks very much for watching I'll put a link to here to another playlist of like tech kind of app kind of themed videos if you're into that sort of thing thank you for watching see you in the next video bye bye you
