## Transcript
 Hey guys welcome back to the channel and to the medical Monday series if you're new here my name is Ali and I'm a junior doctor working in Cambridge and this is video number two in a mini series about preparing for the AFP academic foundation program. This video is really really niche, so if you're not a fifth or 60 or medical student in the UK you probably won't gain much by watching this video. It's full of jargon and it's just pitched at kind of that level. So if you're applying to medicine and you're watching this video you might find it very entertaining seeing us use all this jargon and kind of see what your life might be like 60s down the line but objectively you're not going to gain much educational value from it. If you are a fifth or a 60 medical student and you're thinking of applying to the AFP or you've applied for the AFP and you've got an interview then hopefully this video is going to be really useful because a few months ago I interviewed a friend of mine Mr. Ankara Kajuria, he is a boss, he's done an AFP, he's written a book about the AFP, he runs a course about the AFP and in this video we're talking about how to prepare for the clinical emergency station. So now we're going to cut to me and Ankara from about six months ago talking about this and I hope you find it useful. My understanding of interviews so I had an interview in London and an interview in an EVH. The EVH interview was very sort of personal based you know as questions about your application about wide space questions why do you want to do the AFP that sort of thing whereas in London there were two stations. One of them was a critical appraisal station where we got an abstract to look at for half an hour in advance and we had to critique the abstract and the second was the clinical emergencies where we got like a little scenario saying that you're the FY1 and ANE there's this patient, this patient and this patient how would you how would you proceed and we was like a discussion with the consultants about about this and that. So can you start by giving us some tips about the clinical emergency station? Yeah absolutely. Absolutely. So facing it all say that going for the AFP will be a really good stepping stone towards final preparation. It gets you going in terms of getting into that mindset of how to present in an advice scenario. I don't know how different medical schools do their examinations but certainly I went to Imperial and our final examination was very much in line with some of the techniques that I used to prepare for the AFP so in terms of presentation in terms of structuring your answers. So what is the cause of chest pain for example so you can divide it into central and peripheral you can have cardiac causes pulmonary causes. So just structuring your answers gives you more credibility in the interview. It shows the examiner that you have a way of structuring your answers and actually when you start working as an FY1 that you're not going to just have a scrambled mind when you are presented with one of these scenarios that you can actually compartmentalize. So in the clinical emergency station the way it's usually structured is that it's some kind of emergency and you've got to do ABCDE standard. So generally you'll get there will give you a couple scenarios and they will generally get you to prioritise. So you'll have generally one or two patients who are quite unwell and one patient who is not unwell as such but may have an angry relative or something like that to test your communication skills. And the first thing that you need to do is to justify which patient you would see first and why. Now there are two ways of doing it you can say to the examiner like firstly we're never going to be on a road. There's always people around so we have and this is where you can mention that you've actually been in hospital and you know with the structure of the team is like so you can refer to your senior house officer or the registrar and you can say that I would want to see ex-patient first however I know that this other patient could also become quite unwell and I would escalate and let my registrar know that they're potentially too unwell patients and that I'm going to see this patient and that someone else needs to see this other patient. So you're basically safe safety is absolute priority so your first priority is to be safe and that should come across in the interview because people hiring you want to know that especially for the AFP you need to be clinically sound okay no one's going to take on an academic who is clinically not sound because you're going to have four fewer months to do research work so four fewer clinical months and you need to get your competencies up and if you're already struggling which will come across in the interview if you're not sure about the clinical management of patients then it's not really a good idea for you to enter okay an integrated pathway academic path so I would say safety is obviously the most important thing and actually on the London feedback sheet that we got afterwards there was a mock you know like good satisfactory accident for awareness of the team structure so that's what you're saying you know knowing that you have a registrar and yeah yeah because a lot of people can do the book work yeah but actually they want to know whether people have actually been and seen what the team dynamic is like and how you actually manage patients okay so in terms of in terms of preparing for this kind of it's obviously there's no substitute for having been in A&E in research while there's happening what are the sort of sort of things can we do more like on the book work side or practicing with friends so the key to the clinical emergency or just any clinical station anywhere is to have a very systematic A2 year assessment for patients and which is actually what you do and when I was on FY1 this is what I did for every single patient and I had ingrained this in my mind so well that whenever I saw a patient I would follow this checklist that I developed in my head and actually if you sorry for the plug but actually if you get this book I've detailed verbatim exactly what I would say in an interview for the full A2E okay and with some tips in terms of why you're saying that stuff so in terms of an A2E assessment you want to be short snappy and tell the examiner look you know what you're talking about the key to these interviews is to tell the examiner that you have a structure in terms of how you approach patients and carry on talking and be confident I joke but in my interview I spoke for eight minutes flat okay in a ten minutes station and actually I was so confident in what I was saying that I was covering all the questions that they would have asked me anyway yeah okay so in the end they did ask me a few questions but by then I pretty much covered everything that was on those sheet and you can actually do that very simply by having a systematic A2E okay which I'm happy to talk about also okay cool so I think we'll leave that a little bit of that for now yeah if you get the book or you know you have to buy you can ask you like clinical school library to buy it for you it's like no big deal at all yeah there's also loads of stuff on the internet you know A2E assessments I think like the A2LS have like you know example questions of their thing and that's quite similar too you're unlikely to get A2LS scenarios and the interview itself but I have included some sections in the book if you do want to refer to those and there are then other emergencies that you should know about and again I've briefly touched on those so things like you should know the doses of adrenaline that you're going to administer to a patient with anaphylaxis and that's not just for the interview and it looks great in the interview you can just come up with the doses and you know them but actually also as a as a junior doctor as an FY1 it is absolutely paramount for those emergencies they just know the doses I can give you an anecdote so I was an FY1 I was with one of my S.H.O.S. who had gone in the senior patient so I was sitting by myself and one of the nurses came to me and said Dr. I'm not really happy with this patient who's having an own transfusion and the lips have kind of thrown anaphylaxis and the systolic is reading 70 I'm not really happy and at that point I was like okay my game face on A2LS assessment and this patient is having a full blown anaphylactic reaction so I brought the crash around and I did a systematic A2 you're very quickly I admittedly the adrenaline, the chlorofenamine and the hydrochcourse zone and and this is something you can do as an FY1 it doesn't matter if you're a consultant or you're an FY1 these principles the A2E assessment and knowing the doses it's absolutely paramount so not just for the interview but for life also okay so yeah that's the clinical emergency station it's all about having a structured approach ABCDE and kind of knowing it's as you said it's useful to know kind of on your fingertips the management of important things like sepsis and phlaxis you know if you can bust out G.I.B. if you know if you know exactly what to do for that it looks quite impressive and it includes evidence based into your answers so for G.I.B. there's the blackford and rock old scores and that just shows that you're already academically inclined and they're using evidence based to inform your clinical practice which comes across really well and in terms of sort of resources that some friends of mine found useful the ones who actually got into AFP they said the Oxford Handbook for the Foundation Program is really good in terms of like in management of emergencies because it like fully emphasises ABCDE called a senior you know all the stuff and then gives you you know the exact doses that you need to there are two sources so one is that book and the Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine just the emergency section if you just memorise that section use the Foundation book and have a structure in terms of and practice practice is absolutely key people underestimate how important that is so you know before a month or two months before my interview I was practicing in front of the mirror I was recording myself constantly playing back and so that when I went into the interview that A to E I was just on autopilot it was just coming out I wasn't even thinking what I was saying okay and you need to be at that stage yeah so yeah you want to do if you if you want it to go smoothly and comes to pretty that makes sense I certainly wasn't worth another thing but but now I know for my next interview that you know I want to be practicing front of mirror practicing front of the camera also and doing all that so that's a clinical station can we now talk about the critical appraisal station all right so that is how you prepare for the clinical emergency station it's going to be links in the description to all the stuff we talked about including anchors course and his book is pretty good might as well also links to the Oxford Handbook for the Foundation Program and the Oxford Handbook for Clinical Medicine those will be Amazon affiliate links so if you haven't bought them yet and you want to buy them please can you click on that link because then I make about 50p for each one you buy and that's you know helps me out helps me buy a fifth of a cup of coffee from Costa so thank you very much for watching if you liked the video please give it a thumbs up if you haven't subscribed to the channel please consider doing so there's going to be a few more videos about preparing for the AFP and because I'm a doctor now and a kind of youtuber as well I make videos about life with a junior doctor so you might like those but yeah thank you for watching and I'll see you in the next video. Bye bye
