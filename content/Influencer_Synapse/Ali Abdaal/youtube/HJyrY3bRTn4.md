## Transcript
 So I recently bit the bullet and did the standard YouTuber thing of getting a brand new Tesla Model 3 and so in this video I want to explain to you and more importantly to my mum who's watching why this wasn't just in massive flex and why I think it was actually a pretty reasonable financial decision So I bought the car in July 2020 and I ordered it online which was very nice experience that the base price of the standard edition is 40,490 pounds but I went for the long range model which was 46,990 pounds and then added the white premium interior and the blue paint for the exterior that was a thousand pounds each so adding an extra £2,000 brought up the cost to £48,990 which when you take the insurance and took account which is about a thousand pounds leaves us to a total cost of the car of around £50,000 but this 50k isn't what the car actually cost me it actually costs less than half of that and let's break down white so when you have a business you've got this concept of writing off business expenses which is a term you might have heard of before basically what it means is that if you're buying purely for business use then you can take the cost of it out of the business rather than out of your own personal bank account so if you've got a business and you buy something that's exclusively for business use what you can do is you can write it off as a business expense which means the cost of the item doesn't count as your profits because it's an expense and therefore you don't have to pay any corporation tax on it in the UK corporation tax is 19% at the moment so let's say your business makes a hundred thousand pounds in profit for the year 19% of that goes to the government so you pay 19,000 pounds in corporation tax but let's say I wanted to buy something like a Tesla Model 3 for the business that would be 50,000 pounds and so it would reduce the overall profits of the business down to 50,000 I'd still pay 19% corporation tax on the remainder so I'd be paying 9,500 but my total corporation tax bill is 19% less than the cost of the vehicle so I'm paying 9,500 pounds less corporation tax because this counts as a business expense and so if we think about this 9,500 pounds of tax that we're saving in the end this 50,000 pound car actually only ends up costing my business 40,500 because of the corporation tax saving but that begs the question of is it actually legit to write off a car as a business expense so if you want to write something off as a business expense the rule is that it has to be wholly and exclusively used for the business and any personal use is insignificant or incidental so if you're a youtuber and you're buying a camera for example that's very easy to justify as a business expense because obviously you're using that mostly for business use but it would be a lot harder for me to justify for a car especially because this business doesn't require me to travel all that much so in the UK if you buy stuff as a business but then there is some personal use as well that gets a special tax called benefit in kind and it's like the government things that you're being paid the value of the thing that your business bought you and therefore you kind of get income taxed on that amount and so if this were a normal car that would be quite a lot of tax I would have to pay every year for using it for personal reasons and often that would mean that it's actually not worth buying a car as a business expense but crucially in April 2020 the new budget which the Chancellor of the Exchequer sets out every year said that specifically fully electric cars are exempt from benefit in kind tax and so the benefit in kind tax rate for this car is 0% which means I can buy as a business and I can use it personally however much I want and I won't have to pay any extra tax on it and the reason they've done this is because in the UK over half of the cars that are bought are bought by businesses and so the government's realized that if they incentivize people to buy electric cars by reducing the tax rates that means overall more cars in the UK will become electric and that will be good for the environment in the long term so currently the cars costing £40,500 because of the corporation tax saving but there's still a few more discounts we can add to the price of the car so if you're a business owner and you want to take money out of your business usually the best way of doing that is by something called dividends the problem is that like everything else in life dividends also get taxed and so in England if you're a higher rate tax payer ie you earn more than 37,500 pounds a year which I do then your dividend tax rate is 32.5% so let's say I wanted to take out 10,000 pounds in dividends i'd be paying 3,250 to the government as dividend tax and that would leave me with 6,750 now this is very relevant to our Tesla discussion because the Tesla costs £50,000 and the alternative are you not buying the car and taking out cash instead means that I'd be taking out that £50,000 as a dividend so firstly because that £50,000 is profit it means it's taxed at 19% for corporation tax which takes it down to £40,500 and then I take that £40,500 as a dividend which means it's going to be taxed at 32.5% that means I have to pay 13,162 pounds to her Majesty's revenue and customs which leaves me with 27,337 pounds and 50p so thanks to corporation tax first and dividend tax second this 50,000 that I've tried to take out of the business has gone down to just over 27,000 pounds but that's still not the end of the story we also have to take student loans into account so I spent 60 years at university to study medicine if you didn't know and so my student loan has gone up to about £60,000 that I still have to repay and because the system is quite nice in the UK you only pay a certain percentage of any amount you earn above around £20,000 and so I've got to pay 9% of everything that I earn above a certain threshold to the student loans company so if I want to take out the price of this car as a dividend first it goes down from 50k to 27.3k thanks to corporation tax and dividend tax and then I pay another 9% to the student loans company which takes it down to 24,877 so putting it all together let's think about these two scenarios number one buying the Tesla Model 3 and number two taking out that £50,000 cash instead if I buy the Tesla Model 3 for £50,000 it ends up costing my business £40,500 and I get a Tesla that I can ride whenever I want but if instead I try and take that £50,000 cash instead it gets whittled down by corporation tax the dividend tax and student loan repayments to around £24,000 and so in a way I'm getting this 50,000 pounds car for around 24,000 which is less than half price and personally I would be more than happy to pay 24 grand for a brand new Tesla Model 3 and this whole thing about business expenses is one of the reasons why having your own business is such a powerful thing because especially if you're a solar pranera or a creator or an internet entrepreneur most of the stuff that you're going to buy for business purposes is actually going to be tech and so you can afford a fancy house camera or a fancy house MacBook or like a super wide screen monitor because effectively you're getting all of this stuff at half price or less. If you found this interesting and you'll potentially interested in starting your own business here is a video called how to make money online like the three levels of making money online where I explain how I got started with making money on the internet and how you can do the same. Thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next video. Bye bye.
