## Transcript
 One in guys, welcome back to the vlog. We are here in the beautiful gardens of Harvey Cot, which is one of the areas owned by Gondola Keys College, and we're here for a panty-iron rehearsal. At the moment we're on our GP placement in literally the middle of nowhere, so we've been spending our days seeing patients and drinking lots of tea and coffee. It's been really, really fun, so it's going to be a vlog at some point about a day in the life on GP placement by the coast. Today's a Sunday, so we've got a fairly packed day, and then we're going to be driving two hours to like the Norfolk coastline. So first things first, panty-iron rehearsal, let's go. Hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi. Welcome back to the Shavat Bridge. Today, we're going to be learning about how to break bad news. Your wife was sleeping with all the King's officers and all the King's men. And now you're home, you don't need to put him back together again. My auntie wants her. I didn't know her cut could scream. I may be a game with medical students, but I still know how to have fun. All righty, hi. So I think I'm going to look at this. It's just one of the many sports that we do. That's critical students at King Bridge. It's got a great team and a great squad. It's so easy to get started here with the medics. We're so friendly. We want everyone to join us. Hi, everyone. I do love the cross. The cross is amazing. Yeah, everybody enjoys it. Everybody gets to play. Lots of people participate. Good to get out every once in a while. And so Ben got me into the cross a few last year when he was captain of the team. And I never played it before, but I enjoyed it so much every time. Every time I come down. We're going into this fancy cafe, Jesus College. We're going to get some more done. So, so, so lovely. Right, so there is a chance that this day is going to get a lot more interesting. Because while playing across earlier, I got one of these, which, I think, is a sub-ungual, hematoma. And I've looked at the point in it. And apparently, you need to go to A&E because if it's painful, which this is, they might want to stick a needle in and drain it. And head down to A&E. Show them my finger. And yeah, we'll see what they do. I'm kind of hoping they drain it, because it is quite painful. It's like, Throbby, Throbby kind of sensation. And if they do drain it, then it will be really cool to film it. But, yeah, next up, A&E. So, I think A&E is probably a bit excessive for this kind of problem. Because it's not like a life-threatening or a real emergency. So, I'm calling up NHS111. And we'll see if they reckon this is worth going to A&E for. It looks like there is, like, blue, blood underneath the nail, which is almost covering the whole nail, and it's kind of probbing pain. Actually, I mean, I'm in the hospital right now, but I'm just chilling in the hospital. So, I don't want to go to A&E. Cool. Thank you very much, Rita. All right, take care. Yeah, they've said that someone's going to give me a callback with some guidance and who managements are probably going to say, you know, make sure you don't, like, dramatically injure the finger again, or all this kind of stuff. So, that's very, very short. I mean, they don't have to go to A&E. Kind of sad, because I kind of wanted to film, like, you know, the finger being drained, but to be honest, Adam Brooks A&E is pretty sworn to generally. I don't want to be contributing to the national crisis in A&E. Because people are going to A&E for too much, and more people should be managing their conditions at home, because A&E is really just for, you know, really, really bad things. This is, this is kind of annoying, but it's not really, really bad. And, yeah, a couple of painkillers should do the trick. All right, so that's the saga of the sub-ungual hematoma complete. So now it's time to pick up markers, use them in Rachel, and we're going to drive towards the Norfolk coastline. Thank you very much for watching. If you liked the video, please give it a thumbs up.
