## Transcript
 Hey guys, welcome back to the channel. It is that time of the year again where we are upgrading the desk setup. This time we're going to do a complete overhaul of it. So we're going to change out the desk and replace it with the motorised standing desk by fully. And I'm also going to introduce you to the brand new LG 49-inch ultra wide monitors that I got my hands on a few weeks ago. So let's start the build process and let's see how it goes. So if we surveil the landscape, this is now what the living room looks like. All of that crap over there. We've got some desk stuff, we've got this big ass light, a fully desk that's going to appear soon. Massive ultra wide 49-inch screen part, flat and just loads and loads of cables everywhere. Oh, right. So the old desk has been officially dismantled now time to install the new one. Oh my god, this is really cool. Hey guys, welcome back to the channel. In this video we're going to be talking about this year's standing desk isn't it cool enough and lean on it like I'm really cool like in like pro-nate and flex the vice up to a little bit. The only thing missing now is the chair and the very kind people are fully actually sent me two chairs. So I'm going to test both of them out. This is a sit stand stool. This is what it looks like and the idea is that it doesn't sit still. It actually kind of wobbles. So it encourages you when you're sitting to sort of not be stationary. We're going to not be slung to hunched over. This is quite a nice minimalistic stool setup. That sounds really weird. This is their special H-A-G have chair and if you saw my old desk that a video, you might have heard me lament the fact that I wanted to get the Herman Miller error on chair but my mum wouldn't let me because it was too expensive. So the guys that fully saw that video and it emailed me saying, hey, well, how pretty sent you one of these are going to make chairs for free. I was like, oh my god, this is like the dream when you're a YouTuber. Especially when you're going to take like I am obsessed with creating the perfect desk setup for the last. I mean, pretty much in the age of five. So now to be at the point where companies like fully awesome companies making cool furniture are sending me free desk accessories and disconnection. It's like they're pretty best thing ever. Now, the final thing is just set up the laptop and all of the accessories. So cue the time lapse, I guess. I think that'll do us nicely to finish this vlog. I will obviously be doing a proper my 2019 productivity desk setup video. Once I've got everything set up, just kind of explaining what all the gear is, what all the specs are and stuff. I just wanted to do this quick vlog to show kind of the build process and to thank LG and 30 for sending me the stuff. Guys, if you think you're starting a YouTube channel and you're going to take, just go for it, I'm like, just release video about your desk setup and suddenly companies will start emailing you when you get to try out their stuff which is like the best thing ever. So yeah, thanks very much for watching. If you like this video, I'll put a video over there about my other desk setup playlist so you can have a look through those if you haven't already. Thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next video. Bye-bye.
