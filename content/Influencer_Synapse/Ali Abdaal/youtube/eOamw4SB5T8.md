I'm Ali, a final year medical student at Emmanuel College, Cambridge. This vlogging thing seems quite fun so I'll be vlogging life and other things throughout the year. I'm also making regular videos about application advice for UK medicine applicants.

## Transcript
 Hey guys, welcome back to the channel. It's a Sunday evening and I'm about to head down to London I'm going to London because apparently there is some kind of live TV show being filmed and It's like a panel TV show aimed at the Bangalore-Dashi community of the UK and they're gonna be asking questions about like medicine and university and then sort of thing And I've been invited up as the experts speaker on the beam out so I got a Facebook message this morning So which was very bizarre and I thought why not not really doing anything more exciting tonight Alright, we're in the middle of East London. I've got no idea what's going on, but just gonna head to the venue might be some kind of TV studio It might be someone's house. Like, honestly This is just one of those things that you just go along for the ride and see what happens For me, how are you doing? We are in the studio. Say hello. Hi, guys And we're gonna be part of the UK cat and beam out panel They're gonna be asking us some questions and we're gonna be replying and apparently gonna take phone calls in from the audience So they're very A very odd experience, but it should be quite fun It's clearly running the show for a Bangladeshi British TV show and the main reason behind doing it is so that people from Background switch might not usually have access to information on the medical application process And learn more about what the diagonal statement entails The UK cat, the beam out, and into use too. I'm Chris I'm the president of Imperial College and I say it's an intensive care society So we're answering questions about how to get into medicine Yeah, that was really good fun. We had the questions from viewers back for a moment It was quite scary being under the light initially, but I got used to it quite quickly It was almost like looking you just kind of look at the camera and talk to the camera I don't think we'll ever be able to TV for some long time It's quite fun presenting I feel good.
