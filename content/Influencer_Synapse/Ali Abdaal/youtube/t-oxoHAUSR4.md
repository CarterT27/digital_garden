## Transcript
 Hey friends, welcome back to the channel and this video I'm going to be reviewing the brand new 2020 iPad Pro, I have here the 11 inch and the 12.9 inch. This video is going to be split up into three parts, I'll start by giving you the upfront conclusion in a nutshell what I think about the iPad Pro. Secondly we'll talk about what's new the 3-4 new features that are in the 2020 model of the iPad Pro. And finally I'll end with a discussion about who should buy the iPad Pro 2020 2018 will like talk about a few different use cases and whether or not I would recommend the iPad Pro for those use cases and then I'll just kind of end with some final thoughts. So let's just start with the upfront conclusion and that is obviously these other best iPad ever made. The iPad Pro is just hands down the best tablet on the market but if there's just one word that I can use to describe just like the iPad Pro in general even from the 2018 version but especially the 2020 version that word is overkill. There is way too much power here, there's way too many features that the vast majority of people on the planet weren't used and I personally think there's almost no justification for actually buying an iPad Pro unless either you're a genuine pro user and you have genuine pro needs like I don't have pro needs, I don't know a single person in real life who has pro needs I guess if you're a music producer and you exclusively produce beats on your iPad Pro then it makes sense that you know you need every ounce of power you can get. One category of person that I've never met in real life. The second sort of person is the sort of person who just wants the best of everything and if you've got enough spare cash to burn then you know the iPad Pro is absolutely amazing and to be honest that was the reason why I bought the iPad Pro in 2018. I really didn't need it, I could have easily gotten by with the iPad Air but you know I had spare cash to burn and I considered myself a tech reviewer but even then even all that considered and you know it's now two years on since the iPad Pro 2018 was released and in a way I really don't need these new ones in fact for the very first time ever I'm going to be returning both of these models because my own 2018 iPad Pro model is still overkill enough I could have easily gone by with the iPad Air but yeah basically I don't think there's any reason to get the iPad Pro so that was the inner nutshell. Let's not talk about what's new like what the new features are of the 2020 iPad Pro's and then we'll talk about who this product is for and I'll give some more like opinionated recommendations. So what are the new features? There's basically three of them. The first one is processor speed the processor has been upgraded slightly. It's not as much of an upgrade as the processor jumps usually are they've replaced the X on the processor it's now the 812Z rather than the 812X. Basically like the whole processor speed thing is a bit pointless because the only reason we as consumers care about processor speed is if it improves the kind of responsiveness or the feel of the product for us and my 2018 iPad Pro I have never once thought this is too slow. I also have a 2017 iPad Pro that I recently donated to my cousin. He was checking testing out the differences between the 2017 Pro and the 2018 Pro and he said he couldn't tell the difference. They'll process the speed discussion as kind of point this yes if we want to you know compare decabene score sizes that's absolutely fine and obviously this is more powerful than the previous generation but really who cares about processor speed when was the last time your iPad felt slow. Secondly let's talk about the cameras now this is the thing that's most different about this year's version compared to last year's version we have a square shaped camera hump on the back that sounds weird similar to the square shaped camera hump on the back of the iPhone 11 Pro. What do we get so the iPads in general come with a 12 megapixel camera just fine but like you know the only thing I ever used the camera on the iPad for is for a scanning documents if I feel like it even then usually I tend to just default to my iPhone because it's just so much less like less unwieldy to scan a document with an iPhone than with an iPad. But now they've added a 10 megapixel ultra wide which is similar to the one that you get on the iPhone 11 which is fine like if you want to take an ultra wide photo with your iPad or you're at a meeting or you're at a dinner or something and you're going to take a photo with your iPad and sure go for it that's fine but like for me personally I actually don't care about the camera on the iPad at all because I cannot remember the last time I used the iPad the camera on my iPad Pro even though I used this iPad Pro for hours and hours every single day and take it to work with me and take it everywhere I go. We also have interestingly what's called a LiDAR camera which stands for something a current room where we'll put it up on screen and basically it's a camera that can detect 3D space by using light wavelengths and stuff and what it does is it basically helps the iPad since depth a little bit more better so if we're doing augmented reality type things then it's going to improve the performance on that slightly and a lot of other tech reviewers saying that this LiDAR introduction of the 2020 iPad Pro it feels like a feature designed for the future not a feature designed for the present and so it's kind of pointless to have so those were the changes for the camera and the final feature is that the microphone has been improved slightly apparently it's now a studio quality microphone so this audio is from this one the 11 inch model of the 2020 iPad Pro and this audio is from the 12.9 inch model of the 2020 iPad Pro and this is the audio that you're hearing from my $500 microphone set up with the road NTG4 plus so apparently the microphones have become studio quality maybe it's kind of useful but again I suppose if you're making calls with your iPad or doing conference calls and stuff working from home whatever you're doing then it maybe makes sense to have to have studio quality microphones but to be honest any time I've done video calling on my iPad I've always used my AirPods and AirPods have a built-in microphone into them so again who needs a studio quality microphone in an iPad I guess it's kind of nice to have but hey it's not a make or break feature so those are basically the only three changes to this year's iPad Pro compared to the 2018 model we've got improved processor so we've got an extra ultra wide lens and a lidar camera and we have the studio quality microphone the other thing we've got is that we have trackpad support so if we go on the overhead I have connected this magic trackpad to the iPad and essentially all the dealers is that you can now connect a trackpad and you'll see that instead of getting a mouse instead of getting a like cursor thing you get this sort of round round object as you hover over stuff it sort of changes into you know it's just you know the icon the icon gets bigger or for example let's say we're on oh you know if we go on the taskbar we go on the dock it changes from a cursor into this thing so it it sort of feels like a different way of doing of doing cursor support on the on the iPad this is going to become a lot more interesting I think in May when the magic keyboard attachment for the iPad Pro is released because that's going to have a trackpad built into it so maybe people will use the trackpad feature more often but again for me like I take my iPad around and in fact this trackpad support is now available on iOS 13.4 like the latest version of iPad OS it's not exclusive to the 2020 model so every iPad is basically going to have trackpad support so if you want to connect a trackpad to your thing to your iPad then I guess you could I suppose it's kind of nice if you're editing text so that's opening a text out of it like bear and yeah it's kind of cool you can select text and stuff and it's probably better then trying to sort of mess around with the the touch features of text editing but really it's just one of those kind of minor additions to iPad OS 13.4 rather than an upgrade to the 2020 iPad Pros so those were the new features let's now move on to talk about who should get the iPad Pro and as I basically said at the start of this video I think there are very very few people in the world who truly need an iPad Pro if you're a genuine professional who uses an iPad for pro level things like video editing you know denge photo editing like music production and you need every little ounce of processing power that you can get then fine get the iPad Pro but those sorts of people aren't watching a video like this those sorts of people are not price sensitive when it comes to things like iPads and so you know if I were in that industry and a new iPad Pro would come out and I did all my music production on iPad Pro it would just be a no-brainer I would just buy the latest iPad Pro because I might as well I'm a professional and making money from it I'm usually going to make that money back but for practically everyone else like the iPad Pro is overkill like the processor speed iPad Pro versus iPad Air you're not going to notice a difference Apple Pencil support it's kind of nice that if you're using an Apple Pencil it sort of sticks to the top and charges like that rather than doing that weird thing where it kind of sticks out sticks out of the side with a lightning port that's a very minor thing I don't think it's worth the extra money that you're paying for the iPad Pro so ultimately my personal opinion which I'm going to be sharing with the internet because that's what you do on the internet my personal opinion is that the only reason you would get an iPad Pro unless you're a genuine pro which if you are you're not watching this video the only reason that you're watching this video would get an iPad Pro is if you are desperate for the best hardware because it is it is just objectively slightly nicer than the iPad Air you're desperate for the best hardware and you have a ton of spare cash to burn because really like the in my mind there's just no other reason to get an iPad Pro it's like literally you have the cash to burn and therefore you're going to get it I've got the cash to burn and as a one of you take youtuber I have every reason to just I might as well upgrade to the latest iPad Pro because you know there's basically half my channels tech content is based on iPads but even with all that in mind I'm not I'm going to return these you know having reviews them thanks to Apple's amazing returns policy because they just don't offer anything over the 2018 iPad Pro and in fact to add insult to injury I kind of prefer the old 2018 smart keyboard folio compared to the 2020 smart keyboard folio they changed up the model of the key slightly so that these keys don't like have a little bit more travel than these keys over here but I'm so used to type it on this and I just love this I think it's I think this old model of the smart smart keyboard folio is just one of the nicest typing experiences ever invented when I was typing on this new 2020 smart keyboard I was like oh this is I'm not a fan of this so long story short I'm going to be returning the 12.9 I'm going to be returning the 11 inch and I'm going to be hanging on to my trusty 2018 iPad Pro that I've been taking everywhere with me and using for hours and hours every day that's going to continue should anyone else get the iPad Pro if you're interested in learning more about which iPad you should get then I've got a video called which iPad you should buy and it's an analysis of the iPad budget the iPad mini the iPad air and the iPad Pro and I made that last year but it's still as relevant this year as it was last year because basically nothing has changed essentially between the iPad Pro 2020 and the iPad for 2018 that video actually recently hit a million views and it seems to be resonating with people so I'll put a link over here in the video description if you want to check that out that gives you perfect guidance on what sort of iPad to get some people have asked me on Instagram you know if you can get a refurbished 2018 iPad Pro for 500 dollars whatever should you get it yeah sure go for it it's really no different to the iPad air but if you can get it for basically the same price then this the fact that the Apple pencil locks onto it I think is you know you might as well get the 2018 iPad Pro I'm going to be sticking with the 2018 iPad Pro throughout 2020 and I'll do a review of the magic keyboard when it comes out because that should be an exciting thing but again that's not exclusive to the 2020 model it should be compatible with the 2018 model so that's a review that's a review of the 2020 iPad Pro basically it's overkill you almost certainly don't need an iPad Pro um if you want to get one you won't be disappointed it's the best iPad Apple's ever made obviously it's the best tablet on the market hands down but it's just overkill for most people unless you have this bad cash to burn in which case you know burn that cash on the iPad Pro enjoy it it's one of my favorite pieces of tech and all time but you know most people just don't need it so that was it thank you for watching I'll put a link over here to the what iPad you should buy which kind of goes over this in depth I hope you enjoyed the video stay safe stay at home and I'll see you in the next video bye bye you
