## Transcript
 Hey guys, welcome back to the channel. If you're new here, my name is Ali, I'm a junior doctor working in Cambridge and this is another installment in the monthly favorite series where I talk about stuff that I enjoyed that month. In this video we're going to be talking about a book, a blog post, a podcast and a board game and there's going to be timestamps in the video description and an append comments of feel free to skip around the video if you feel like it. But yeah, let's get started. So the first thing I want to talk about is a book called Bad Blood by a chap called John Kerry Rue and this is absolutely amazing. Its tagline is secrets and lies in a silicon valley startup and it tells the story of the startup Theranos. I think that's how you pronounce it, which was a startup that was aimed to revolutionize blood testing and they claimed that they could make these little boxes that would fit in your house and that you could give it a small amount of sample from your finger and it would be able to run hundreds of blood tests on those and over the course of about 10 years the company ended up defrauding investors out of billions of dollars because their technology just didn't quite work and they were selling a lie pretty much and this is the gripping story of that startup and how eventually it was found out and I don't really read much nonfiction that's not in the realm of either self help or like entrepreneurship piece stuff. But after hearing some people recommend this book including Bill Gates, he said, I couldn't put this thriller down. I thought I'd give it a go and I'm really glad I did. It feels like not a nonfiction book like my idea of nonfiction books is that they're boring or factual or stuff and this was I mean this could have been a fictional thriller and it would have been just as entertaining and over the course of about four days and on my surgery placement at the moment so I have to get up half past six in the mornings and usually I'd like to get to bed by sort of a half 10-11 so I can get 7-8 hours of sleep but in the three four days that was reading this book I ended up staying up until like three a.m every night just because I literally couldn't put it down so if you're at all interested in reading a thriller about the whole Silicon Valley startup billionaire type stuff you should definitely get this book it's absolutely fantastic if you haven't read it already and as usual I'm going to be giving this copy away because obviously I read this on Kindle I just Amazon primed this because you know so I can show it off in this video so feel free to comment anything you want in the comments below and I will randomly pick a winner in next month onto the favorite video and I'll mail you a copy of this book with a little message from me at the front. Uh yeah let's move on. Okay secondly I want to talk about a podcast that I recently started listening to and it's called Invest like the best bit of a crap name but it's a really really good podcast and it's run by a guy called Patrick O'Shoracy who runs his own hedge fund asset management sort of thing so he does interviews with people some of them are professional investors and they take a deep dive into investing and how they value companies and all this sort of stuff that you might be interested in if you're interested into business or economics or finance and stuff but the episodes that I personally found the most enjoyable were when he was interviewing people that were outside the direct field of investing so to podcast episodes that I listened to this month were number one with a chat called Eugene Way and secondly by a chat called Tim Urban and the first guy Eugene Way used to work for Amazon and a host of other tech companies and he's now like a tech blogger slash journalist and he wrote a really really interesting article a couple of weeks ago entitled status as a service which I will link in the video description it's a really really long read but it's very interesting because it analyzes how the success of very very a social network's Facebook Instagram Snapchat is all based on the fact that we as humans are status-seeking monkeys and that we will do whatever we can to most efficiently maximize our social capital and kind of taking those two points of view it explains all of the success that Facebook and Instagram etc have had and also explains the behaviour that people using those platforms tend to fall into so that's an interesting article that he wrote but then on this podcast they just talk about a very wide range in ranging range topics it's always really hard to sum up exactly what a single podcast episode is about so I'll just link it in the description below and you should definitely have a listen to it because it's really really good and the second episode was with a chat called Tim Urban who you might know is the chat behind the blog wait but why which is one of their most well popularly red blogs on the internet and that again was really really really interesting if you don't follow away but why it's probably the single blog that I would recommend you follow if you only had to follow one blog on the internet he's just got an incredible array of articles ranging from stuff about life advice but also very good breakdowns of things like how Elon Musk's companies fit into his wide of vision he's also got a TED talk about motivation and procrastination and stuff that people always find particularly helpful but again this podcast episode was really good because Tim Urban breaks down his process of how he researchers and creates all this incredible content and again they're just touched on a load of other things that I could possibly mention in just a like a two minute segment on this video so again I'll link it down below you should definitely listen to that but yeah invest like the best is a new podcast that I've recently discovered and I'm it's now part of my weekly schedule of podcast listening cool let's move on thirdly I want to talk about a blog that I discovered a few months ago and it's run by a chat called Tiago 40 who is like you know I thought I was a productivity nerd but this guy it takes productivity nerd he knows to like the next level times 10 and his whole blog blog is about kind of about these like productivity tricks and systems and mindsets and hacks and just a generally novel way of dealing with work and dealing with all the responsibilities that we all that we all have and the blog post that got me into this was called building a second brain and in this he talks about his his system using various different apps for organising all of the various inputs into his life you know like things like news articles and books and to do lists and all this sort of stuff and how he then processes those using other set of apps and then how he outputs that into creating content for his blog and just generally being able to recall insights that he's had through reading content because a big problem that anyone who reads a lot has is that you know you read something and then how do you then remember it and in this blog post building a second he talks about how actually you should have an app something like Evernote that acts as your second brain which means that as you read stuff you are kind of summarising it you're distilling it it's down to its essence and then you're putting it into Evernote and then you're semi-regularly reviewing all that stuff so that you eventually build up this treasure trove of knowledge in your brain using your second brain to help with that so that's a really interesting blog post and then after I read that it got me down the whole rabbit hole of everything else on this website and now my own productivity systems have changed I'm not quite his kind of 10x level of productivity I've kind of watered his stuff down a bit so that it fits my life personally and I'm experimenting with that over the next few weeks and months and I'll hopefully be making some more videos about how I've incorporated Tiago's teachings that sounds really weird into my own productivity system so yeah you should definitely check out the website I'll link it down below it's called Forte Labs and the blog is called Praxis yeah let's move on and finally to wrap up this week I want to talk about a physical product which is a board game this week and it's called Avalon and this is one of my favorite board games of all time and it has added it has provided so many endless hours of joy for me and my friends we first discovered this in our final year of medical school and once we did it just completely transformed the experience because when we were in the final few months preparing for our final exams almost every night at about 11pm like my my housemates the other medical students that are lived with would congregate in my room we'd order pizza or have some drinks or whatever and we would end up playing Avalon and Avalon just so so good we'd play it until like two three in the morning I should probably talk about what it actually is so if you've ever played the game mafia or the game where will you'll know the premise basically the idea is that in these sorts of games there are some good guys and there are some bad guys but the bad guys know who the bad guys are but the good guys don't know anything and so it becomes a game of talking and trying to manipulate other people and trying to convince everyone that you're a good guy when you're actually a bad guy and trying to work together with the other bad guys to try and win the game whereas the good guys are trying to work together to figure out who the bad guys are based on how the game works and based on body language and all this sort of stuff and it's really nice because it's not a board game in the traditional sense and that the board is not the main focus but it's the conversations between people and the lies and the truth and stuff that's the main focus and it's created so so much drama so many heated discussions but you know we're all friends at the end of it you know it's stuff like no I'm a bad guy how do you say that what the hell is wrong with you any kind of people swearing each other across the room like no I'm definitely a good guy what the hell is going on I've lost my voice I was at a stagnate over the weekend we were singing lots of karaoke and I ended up over doing it a bit as well as one does but anyway a lot really really good good board game the premise is that you know every one of the group and it's it's suitable for between five and ten players and I've played it with all sorts um everyone in the group are adventurers in the world of like King Arthur and you have to go in five different missions and each mission takes a different number of people but the bad guys are trying to fail the missions and the good guys are trying to succeed the missions and so based on whether a mission succeeds or fails you can kind of work out based on who was on that mission whether they might be a good guy or a bad guy so let's say there's a mission with three people in it and it fails you know that at least one of those three people must be a bad guy and so you incorporate that logic into the rest of your body language he sort of he's acting a bit shifty I bet he's a bad guy she's a good guy that's sort of stuff and there's also all these extra characters like there's a guy called Merlin who's a very interesting character because Merlin is a good guy who knows who everyone else in the group is he knows the identity of the bad guys so he has to influence the game when he can but he can't just come out and say guys I'm Merlin the bad guys are Tom Dick and Hamza he has to do it in a slay way because if the bad guys find out who Merlin is they automatically win so Merlin becomes his interesting character that's pulling the strings without trying to make it too obvious that he knows what's going on and then there's other special characters and the game becomes more and more advanced the more often you play it and this is something that even now that we've all graduated anytime we have a mass congregation like we had our second graduation ceremony a few months ago everyone came back to my place and we ended up playing avalan for about four hours so yeah really good times you should definitely get the board game avalan if you don't have it already and you have a group of between five and ten friends to play with i guarantee you will add tons and tons of fun to your life so that's it for this video thank you very much for watching if you liked the video please give it a thumbs up if you haven't subscribed to the channel then please consider doing so have a lovely day and I will see you in the next video whenever I've hopefully got my voice back goodbye
