Hey friends, so you may have heard me mention a few times in previous videos that last year a bunch of my stuff got stolen from my Tesla and it got me thinking - what would I do if I had to replace everything I had, but on a smaller budget? In this video, I take you through the three versions of the same 'Every Day Carry' I'd have at different price points - Budget, Premium and Luxury!

## Transcript
 Hey friends, welcome back to the channel. In this video we're going to go over everything that's in my bag as part of my everyday carry But because a lot of this stuff is quite expensive, we are also doing a cheaper budget version of exactly the same set of and a premium version of exactly the same set up So for everything in the bag you'll have three different tiers of pricing so let's get started with the bags themselves Now the one that I use on the daily is the peak design every day backpack 20 litres This runs you about 200 pounds and it will stick the dollar price over here Now this is supposed to be a camera bag Which is why it opens from the side and let the access to the pockets that way But it's also good in that it has a laptop compartment that can fit a laptop that I've had and some notebooks It's got this sort of magnetic front access thing so you can put like quick access stuff in there And it has one of these like anti theft mechanisms Which means if someone just tries opening the bag it won't work they have to pull it down to be able to open it And it's quite convenient because it's got a top handle and it's got two side handles and it's got obviously the straps at the back So if I'm no longer on the underground for example, I wouldn't have it in backpack mode I'd just be carrying it on side But it works very nicely for all those reasons So for 200 pounds this is quite expensive and so this is the luxury item But for 50 pounds cheaper we have the peak design every day zip Now obviously there are cheaper bags from this but I do really like the peak design every day zip This is 15 litres and we'll set you back about 140 pounds And it's got the same vibe as the peak design every day backpack in that you've got the bag situation opening from the side And like all good bags you've got your laptop and iPad and the compartment You know quick access compartments But it's different because it's got this kind of zip mode rather than that like you know magnetic access top Thinky yeah, it's quite nice it's quite sleek and then we have the genuinely budget option Which is about 30 pounds this was the random bag with found on Amazon Jan Sport nothing particularly interesting about it It's got a front pocket that you can put quick access things into with a few like kind of mini pockets within and it's got a main pocket compartment That is just general bag opens up get the job done you can just chuck stuff in here Happy days so these are the three bag packs that we're playing with and I'm gonna go over everything that fits inside my luxury one And also what other products would be in the premium and budget addition as well So first thing to know is that we have a laptop and so my everyday laptop of choice is the M1 Pro 14 inch 2021 model MacBook Pro This one has 32 gigabytes of RAM and a one terabyte hard drive and retails at 2,400 pounds this is honestly a bit overkill I don't really do much editing myself anymore and I don't really need a process at this fast But hey, it was a new laptop so I thought I'd get it and that's why went for the M1 Pro rather than the M1 Max And I prefer the size of the 14 inch rather than the 16 inch and so within the whole what's in my bag This goes into a little laptop compartment in the bag Fits in there nicely and that is my daily driver sorted now a more budget but still premium version of the same thing would be the M1 MacBook air This is the laptop we get for all of our team members this one retails for a thousand pounds So much cheaper than the one that I have and actually to be honest I do prefer the design of the MacBook air over the design of the new M1 Pro series of 14 inch laptops But that slots nicely into our mid tier premium Backset up and then on the extreme budget side we have the ASUS Zenbook something or other which retails for 500 pounds So half the price of our MacBook air and kind of basically does the same stuff It's Windows rather than Mac and you all know I don't really like Windows rather than Mac But to be honest it gets a job done fine This is the ASUS Zenbook 14 and so that will fit nicely into the non-laptant compartment of our bag And to be honest you don't really need a laptop compartment unless you like throwing your bag around quite a lot Next we have a tablet now the budget setup does not have a tablet in it because I think a tablet or an iPad is a very very optional device Rather than a requirement The laptop is a requirement that iPad is a bit unnecessary and so we're saving some money on the budget front But on the premium front and going into our premium bag we have the cheapest iPad the basic iPad this retails for 329 pounds It's pretty solid and it's a very good iPad if you are on a budget so that will go into our A little iPad Compotment and then we come to the one that I actually carry on a daily basis and you might be surprised to learn that it's not in fact an iPad Pro It is in fact an iPad mini which retails of 479 plus the 1209 pound apple pencil plus the 50 pound smart cover and this is just a setup that I was carry with me It's basically a glorified Kindle very easy way to tend to take handwritten notes with the paper life screen protector and very easy way to actually Read books on the Kindle and therefore that goes nicely in the bag next we have a physical notebook that I actually carry in all three of my Back setups and that is the essentially part time productivity planner This is my own stationary. Yes, I've launched a stationary brand It'll be link in the video description if you want to check it out. It's a part time productivity planner Which means there aren't any dates and so I carry this in my bag at all times and it asks you each day What do you grateful for three things most important task? What's on the mic to do list and on the other side? We've got a brain dump. We've got one thing I learned today And we've got what was the most story worthy moment of the day and the idea behind it being part time is that there's no dates Because like an issue that I used to have with other productivity planners is that so it would always have dates on them And so if I didn't manage to actually fill it in one day and then another day and then another day I don't know put all these blank pages and then I'd feel very kind of down about myself and feel like I'm a bit of a waste man Because I couldn't fill out the thing whereas with a part time productivity planner There's no dates, which means you can basically just use it whenever you want and Conveniently it fits nicely into all these bags as well and it retails for only 25 pounds Which means and it comes in this nice light packaging This is the unwrapped version. We've got a few of these to give away as gifts to friends and so it goes into all of our different setups We also have two other products in the essentially product line We have this might do list pad Which I don't carry my bag just happy in my desk at all times and again, this is like it's an optional thing It's like each day you can just decide if I want to use this What's my most important task and what else is on my might do list and once you've done with it You rip it off and you can either turn it around or reuse it. It was taken that we cycle Then yeah, this is on my desk rather than in my bag and we also have this really cool set of three notebooks Where we have these sort of a six-sized dot grid notebooks that say journey before destination This is going to be fun and it's the climb So we're going to put one of each in a little a little back setups as well Yeah, if you're in the market for some analogue products you should definitely check out the essentially product line my brand new stationery We're going to be launching more physical product at some point. It just kind of cool to be able to launch for the product And yeah, we've already had I think a few hundred orders off of Instagram and loads of people like who have already received There's the pre-orders who are getting them in and they look pretty sick. So yeah, check them out Anyway next on the list we have a good pair of noise-canceling headphones and in the luxury edition I go on that I use on the daily. I use the Bose QC700 which are probably some of my favorite noise-canceling headphones I think these we tell in about 400 pounds for the price of it here I don't carry them in a case or anything. I just chuck in my bag And so in my top compartment I have my iPad mini my essentially planner and my nose-canceling headphones Usually and my little mini mini little notebook moving on for the premium rather than the luxury edition of the setup We are in fact using the Sony WHMX3s I think which I think we're about 200 something pounds will put the price over here and these come in a nice little carry case It's kind of cool so you can just like if you care about using a case you can just chuck the case in your bag and Happy days. I'm not really much of a case person, but hey, what else? I can go nicely in this compartment as well along with my part-time productivity planner and oh it fits really nicely And then we come to the budget option which is the anchor sound core and this is actually a surprisingly good pair of noise-canceling headphones That retails for around about 85 pounds which is a very good price for the five-but-you-get Pretty reasonable sound quality and pre-reasonable noise cancellation Then I'll quite as good as the other pan for you ones, but they're definitely the best bang for your buck And so with a budget setup that thing are nicely in here along with all of our other stuff Next up on the water bag we have a camera so I always carry a camera with me But let's start with a budget option which could be something like the Sony A6400 That retails for I think just under a thousand pounds although you might say there's not very budget Yes cameras can be expensive. The one I started with was the Sony A6000 which is actually still a pretty good camera And you can get it for about 200 or 300 pounds something like that. Yeah, I think it's kind of good to always have a camera And so that always features in my bag in some capacity then on the premium and we have the Sony A7C Which I think retails for about 1500 pounds and yes, that's a lot more expensive But it's a full-frame camera and you can get like an interchangeable lens for it So you can use a 50 mil like this one is or you can use a zoom lens like the 28 to 75 All sorts of very options, but pretty cool having such a fantastic photo camera with you at all times And if you're a vlogger you can use this for vlogging as well And this can actually go in our camera compartment, so I don't think this up and stick it in here somewhere Now I have an easy access to that and then we come to our luxury setup So the camera of choice that I actually use is this one and the lyker Q2 Now this retails for about 5,000 pounds and it's a bit excessive and has a fixed 28 millimeter Sunmi Lux 1.7 lens It's definitely overkill Do you notice you can probably even get nicer photos with the A7C or with the A6000 or something? I'm not using it using this, but I do find that it does encourage me to take it out and take more photos And it's a camera that I only use for photos I don't use it for YouTube that use it for vlogging anything like that So this is my photo only camera that I like to carry with me at all times and similarly that That goes into one of the camera compartments over this bag pack And usually have it in compartment number two Now people often ask why would you bother carrying a camera with you if you have a phone and yes, I agree But to be honest, I think there's something so much nicer about photos that you actually take with the camera We'll put some examples on here So when I was at university, I used to carry Sony A6000 and I have some incredible photos from that Then I graduated as Sony A73, similarly amazing photos from that And now I carry the lyker with me, so I snap photos here and there as well when I'm out and about with friends And I think these photos are generally a bit nicer than what I'd get on my iPhone Next on the list, we have pens Now I actually carry all of these around but they are at different price points At the budget end, we have the moody fine liner pen type things I get these from moody, these are great Then on the premium end, we have the Uniball fine line of series Similar price to these ones, I think, but yeah, probably the same But then on the sort of more luxury end, we have the Lami Swift Uniball fine line of thing Which is my favorite pen of choice these days But it sets you back about 50 pounds and it's not that much better than these other two More basic moody or Uniball ones But either way, I just like take all of these and I shove them in my bag So in this bag, for example, at the top In our laptop pocket, we also have a little slot for pens and things So that slots are nicely over there and that means I always have a pen to hand if I need one Now we come to charging peripherals, and I think fancy here, obviously every laptop that we carry Probably needs a charger I often don't need to carry my M1 Pro charger around because it's got amazing battery life But hey, I've got one anyway just in case I also always have with me one of these like anchor power thingies That have two USB-C slots on them because if I'm gonna have a traveling And I'd like to be caught with that with a charger for my phone Obviously, you probably want something like a lightning cable if you have an iPhone But one thing I got recently is this thing, this is this is a bit expensive This is a 129 pound max save duo Which plugs in via lightning to USB-C And lets you charge your phone and your Apple watch at the same time But this is really handy because my iPhone can charge What am I safe? But also, if I am out and about Or if I'm staying the night at my mum's place or at a friend's house I always would forget to bring an Apple watch charger around But now because I carry the max save duo around with me It means I'm never without charging from my Apple watch And the really convenient thing about the max save duo is that it folds up nicely And it can just fit into along with the lightning cable A little slot at the side of my bag So we're going to stick it in this side compartment over here And then I just forget about it knowing that it is there if I ever need it And the final thing that I was carried with me is these more This more fee set of cables I've been there's been so many times where my life has been saved By having just this set of three cables in my in my bag We have USB-C to USB-C We have USB-C to lightning and we have USB-A to lightning as well I almost never need to take the sound But whenever I do, I'm like oh, I'm so glad I have this And also, it friends are like oh, have you got a spare charging cable or whatever I can always bust this out and there's always going to be something useful in there And so this is one of those things that I'll just keep in my bag at all times And usually I just forget about it because I never need to use it But it is there to save my life as and when I actually need it And so the convenient thing about this peak design bag is that the charges And we'll go into the bottom And so that's all the things with the bag So let's talk about the everyday carry items And this is all fairly simple I carry the iPhone 13 Pro as my daily driver of choice Obviously, you know, if you're on more of a budget, you can get something else I use the airport pros as my headphones are choice But if for example, you're looking for budget versions of the airports You can use the nothing air or if you like the even cheaper anchor sound core life peak reads Which are also basically airports but a little bit cheaper and so there's all going to go in my pocket This is my keys for my apartment and yeah in my budget setup And why not let's put these ones in the premium setup? I mean obviously I want sticking the box but I'm just gonna put it in there for the sake of the video Oh, and one thing I forgot to mention I used the Apple Watch Series 7 Although if you want a more budget option You can use the Apple Watch SE which is broadly just as good or if you want to save money You don't even have to watch it all it's all a bit pointless I don't really use it for that much, but hey, it's kind of nice to have so overall the everyday carry setup that I use I think if my quick maths in my head is correct It's gonna be about 14,000 dollars Which is Significantly excessive mostly because of the price of the ridiculously expensive camera and the beefed up MacBook Pro The premium edition is close to about $6,000 Obviously still very excessive and you could easily get rid of the camera if you don't want a camera or down Read all these things just an example and then I don't know how much the body one comes to We'll probably put it over there, but obviously the laptop is the most expensive part of it depending on what kind of iPhone you have if you include it in the price You get that but to be honest if I had to really pair it down the only thing I would actually want to carry on the daily is a laptop and of course The essentially pod time productivity planner to be honest everything else is a bit superfluous now if you care about maximizing your productivity in an intentional and fun way Obviously you want to get the essentially series link in the video description But if you want a really easy and automatic way to be more intentional with how you're spending your time He might like to check out an app called rise Now rise is a desktop app that I've been using since November 2021 and I've been using it every day to automatically track my time across my Mac And it's also available on Windows and basically what rise does is that once you install it It just sits in the background and automatically tracks all of the things that you're doing on your computer So for example in the month of January You can see that my average time worked per week was 28 hours and five minutes So clearly I'm not working a full-time job I also apparently spent 42 hours and 36 minutes on a video calls mostly via zoom Which gives you an idea of how it's been my time and the cool thing is is that every day if you want it can give you a little summary of how you spend your time that day And you can look at it and be like down I didn't realize I spent like two hours and 18 minutes watching YouTube videos That's probably that I should probably cut down on that time for my future work sessions tomorrow If you want to check out rise and track your own time Then you can head over to rise.io or click the link in the video description And if you're one of the first thousand people to use the coupon code Aliim Dal you will get 25% off the first three months off your subscription And best part is they've even got a free 14 day trials You can just check it out completely for free and try out all the features without needing to pay a thing So thank you rise for sponsoring this video and thank you very much for watching if you like this video You might like to check out this video over here Which is all about how I actually use some of these products to manage my time and help myself be more productive if that's the thing that you care about So check out that video over there and thank you very much for watching. Bye bye
