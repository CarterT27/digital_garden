## Transcript
 Hey guys, welcome back to the channel. If you're new here, my name is Ali and I'm an FY1 junior doctor working in Cambridge and in today's episode of Medical Mondays we're going to be taking a comprehensive look at what it takes to study medicine in Europe. So we've just had results day and if unfortunately you didn't get any offers to study medicine in the UK or you missed your offers, there might be another option and that is to study medicine in Europe. Now I really didn't know anything about this until a few weeks ago I got a message from this guy called Adola who runs an agency that helps people study medicine in Europe and he message me asking you if I can advertise this thing but I replied saying that why don't you come over to my place we can record a video where I interview you and you explain to all of the viewers exactly how it works like you know what sort of grazed you need what one of the entrance exams like is the degree even registered by the GMC all of this sort of stuff. So he came over to my place we recorded like half an hour long interview and in that interview I tried asking all the questions that I think a prospective medical applicant would ask. So yeah welcome to medical Mondays. I hope you enjoy this long form interview this is quite niche so it's not going to interest anyone other than people who are interested in studying medicine in Europe but hopefully you'll find it useful. I'll see you at the end. Hi Adola. Welcome to the YouTube channel and to this new thank you so much. My name is Adola. I am a fourth year medical student and I currently study in Bulgaria. Okay so you study medicine in Bulgaria? Yes. Okay and you've been doing it for the last four years and it's a six year course. Yes. It's a six year course and it is divided into three sort of sections so the first two years are pre-clinical then the next three years the year three to five you have your clinical years and then the final year is an internship which is basically like F1 in the UK it's equivalent to it and the GMC recognizes that as well. Okay so we're going to talk about what it's like to study medicine in Europe and I think kind of aiming this towards people who are applying to medicine but maybe want to have an extra option just in case they don't get any offers or in case they don't make their offer or for other reasons. Is that right? Yes I mean that's exactly what it's for because a lot of people they don't meet their offers or they don't have the grade requirements to even apply for medicine in the UK. I know when I was applying my tutor told me that there's not really any point apply for medicine but I still gave it a shot but for me it didn't work out and knowing that I had the back up plan was something that really helped out. Okay so I guess my first question is what sort of grades do you need to do medicine in Europe as opposed to the UK? Because I imagine it's lower requirements. Yes. Yes. Yes. So there are requirements so much lower than the UK. Some universities have a minimum requirement which is usually C grades. Some universities don't have any grade requirement but they do want you to do biology and chemistry A levels. Now the way it works is each university has an entrance exam which you need to study for and pass in order to actually make it to the university and then the top students that are ranked and they are given admission. So that's sort of how it works. It's more entrance exam based then based on your A levels which gives you a second chance. So if you don't do so well in your A levels you can still make it up in the entrance exam. Okay I'm moved forward. And is there a standardized entrance exam or does every university have their own one? Every university have their own one but they give a syllabus and you can work around it and they give practice papers. You can study for it very easily and make it through. Okay and in terms of the timeline when do you is it similar to the UK we start in September and you finish in July or what? So majority of the universities have a very similar timeline so as you said start in September and finish July time. There's one university called Clebin Medical University that has a bit of a different schedule so they start in February and then they finish in the following December. Okay so for the most part it's similar kind of structure to the UK. Okay so what would you say are like why wouldn't you want to go to Europe? Like why is it like what it be fair to say that it's better to study medicine in the UK or do you think that actually going to Europe that is kind of a good thing to do? I'll say for the most part of it getting a place to study medicine in the UK is ideal because it's more convenient. Okay but in terms of your actual degree and the job prospects that come with it I don't really see much difference between studying in Europe and studying in the UK because at the end of the day you'll talk the same things because medicine is medicine and at the end of the day if you didn't get that offer in the UK yeah there's no point looking into other career prospects if you do have the option of studying medicine in Europe. Okay so yeah because I've been getting a lot of messages from people recently saying that oh I didn't get any offers I'm therefore I'm not sure if medicine is for me at all you know sure take a gap your blah blah and yeah prior to kind of talking to you I just never really considered that yeah you could go to Europe study medicine. The idea I had in my head was that oh you have to have really rich parents to be able to pay the however tens of thousands of pounds fees to go to Europe or the Caribbean or wherever. The Caribbean yeah I know it's a bit expensive but when it comes to Europe the fees are actually lower than the UK it's 8000 euros per year which is roughly around 6000 pounds and the cost is split between two semesters so you pay 3,000 pounds in the beginning of your first semester it starts in September and you pay the other 3,000 pounds at the start of your second semester which usually starts in February okay and what about in terms of living costs and stuff like what's what's your overall cost of. So living costs are fairly cheap as well compared to the UK my personally my living costs come to around 500 pounds or less a month is that including rent yes no my rent is about 230 pounds a month and I have my own one bedroom apartment okay yeah okay that's like I want to pay it about 10 days in in Cambridge and I've had a lot of money but I know my friends when I speak to them they're all paying ridiculous prices because they're going to universities in London and they're paying their rent is based on weeks not once and yeah so you can get a nice luxury one bedroom apartment starting from around 200 and 30 which I'm paying yeah to and it can get expensive if you're sure yeah if you're sure yeah absolutely yeah yeah exactly all the stuff okay so you are in Bulgaria yeah and I know people in Prague what are the options do people have they have plenty of options there's Czech Republic as you said there's Bulgaria where I study there's Romania there's Hungary there are other options as well available in places like Poland but I don't know too much about that I'm no more about Bulgaria Romania and Eastern Europe. Yeah there's actually two f1s in my current batch in Cambridge who are from Poland and really kind of I don't know they applied through some random scheme speaking of how do you get into a bit like f1 or f2 or whatever so from Europe it's pretty straightforward it is pretty similar to the way you would apply yourself okay so you would go for your GMC registration number and you would apply through the GMC and then you'd look for jobs the same way a UK student would but when you when you're when you're graduating in the UK you apply for an f1 and f2 kind of pushed together but you were saying before we we were at this then you go so because you already have done 6th and you're 6th year in Bulgaria which is an internship yeah and that's recognized by the GMC as f1 it's not exactly the same but they do recognize it and they do exempt you from going straight into f1 so you kind of apply for just f2 jobs okay but if you wanted to you could go for f1 as well you could but I'm not sure whether there many post available for f1 for international students usually they do go straight out onto f2 okay so how many posts are available for f2 students I got the impression from talking to these f2 these f1s at my hospital that it's quite hard to get a place where you want it is but because of the UK MLA which is coming in it's going to be a bit more based on that so that's an entrance exam to actually apply for your GMC registration number it's going from 2022 and it's an exam which is going to be given by both UK students and international students so after so anyone that does apply now and from now on they all have to sit that exam so you're where you get a place and where you can find jobs they'll all range depend on what your UK MLA score is like okay so do we know that it's just going to be based on that or is this kind of up in the air at the moment we're not quite sure it is a bit up in the air at the moment which is why I can't give too much details about that and as far as my knowledge it goes it's going to be mainly based on that school okay okay fair enough so it sounds like studying medicine in Europe then becomes an option it's not the ideal option as you said because of lack of convenience and just you know we've got student finance in the UK but you have to upfront the future yourself so you either have to in terms of finance if you have to do if it is a struggle then definitely applying in the UK is going to be a much more convenient option for you and obviously traveling abroad it's a bit of a hassle yeah but there are agencies like one that I am part of myself we're going to connect Europe where we help students apply abroad we help them find apartments hold them with the whole process okay yeah so how does this work so let's say I've missed my offers and I'm thinking oh I don't really want to do a gap here and I find out I'm like the 15th August or whatever result today is what is the process and how does your agency or other kind of agencies fit in do you see agency like what how what's how does it work so you don't actually need an agency you can apply independently contact the universities directly yeah register for the entrance exam and sit the entrance exam which is hold at the campus of the university okay so you're saying that you don't need an agency you can just contact the university so let's say I missed my offer I could contact a random university ex in Prague and say hey I want to apply to you and that they have their own application processes yes now the reason you'd use an agency is because this process can be quite tedious a bit and it can be full of different obstacles that you may not know how to overcome so what we do is we made the process very simple what happens is because there is an international process you have to get your documents legalised and notarised and all of this legal stuff you have to go through and it can be quite costly and it can be a bit of a hassle so we take care of all of that we help with the entrance exam as well so with the resources available and it might not be enough what the university provides so we have our own resources which we've written as medical students to you know give that sort of boost to actually and help them out when they go for the entrance exam okay and all of that at the end of today helps students when they are applying to the university to actually get the admission they want okay so how do I know which university I want to apply for you can research all the different universities on our website we have all the universities that we cover listed and a little bit of information on each of them so in terms of academia all the universities are very similar in terms of facilities and the teaching but what it really comes down to is the social life and living standards because certain cities such as Sophia and Plotiv they're quite big and they're quite so for Sophia for in particular it's a very big city it's sort of like and it's the capital city of Bulgaria so if you're studying there you're going to have a much different life to say another city which is called Vana and they have a medical school there which is right next to the beach okay so it really depends on what kind of social life you're looking for and how how big the international community as well so with university like Vana you have a lot of German students there whereas where I am Plotiv there's a massive massive UK based community in terms of this international students that's not either okay and it is the other kind of thing that you would find on their website they would say that we have no other students from the UK or is that to me you kind of have to know that's something that's why I'm here about this okay right so so I miss my offer and it's currently August when do I have to apply it I'm applying for that you're the following year you're kind of applied for that year there's an entrance exam for a few of the universities in September in early September and then the course usually starts late September after all the entrance exam is done and for the university that I study at Plotiv Medical University the entrance exam dates for this year or third of September and 10th of September so what you do is you have to apply before one of those dates you register for the entrance exam you start gathering our documents and getting them done through the legal process and then when you go for the your entrance exam you have to hand in the documents alongside an application form then on the 15th of September you get a list of all the students that have made it through and if you're on that list then you can then start looking to pack your bags and actually move a broad doll up okay so it happens like really really good so very quick so you get results in within like two weeks you have to take this exam or three weeks and then then you're in that other country by the following month if it's if you're still thinking about you can still apply for the following year yeah or as I said there's a university that starts in February or Pleaven Medical University so you still get a bit of time with that one okay but if you're looking to just start straight away that's the lanoption because you can do the entrance exam early September and let's start looking to move abroad by the end of September okay cool so it sounds like studying medicine in Europe is definitely an option it's like are all the qualifications recognised by the UK yeah all of the universities in Bulgaria definitely recognised in the UK yeah you can find a information about um European students and foreign students on the GMC website and all the universities that they recognise there's a whole list of them okay and um all the information is down the GMC website for that okay right so okay so it's starting by as in Europe everything is taught in English isn't or do you have to learn like Bulgaria or Czech or whatever so the way it works in Bulgaria specifically is that you have your professors they all speak English and your course is completely taught in English however you do learn Bulgarian on the side as well mainly to speak with locals when you're out in about and also to speak with patients who might not know English later on when you're in your kind of cool years but it's very basic stuff nothing that people should be worried about because um over time when you're actually there by the time when you're actually need to use the language you'll be there for a pretty long time so you'll pick it up along the way so you're so you're in fourth year now yeah so you started clinicals already yes so you do talk to patients in Bulgaria the patients that don't know English I try to use Bulgarian even though my Bulgarian is not up to scratch okay but the universities do also provide translators if you're Bulgarian really isn't that good okay so learning Bulgarian isn't much of an issue it is a part of the course that you should be able to speak Bulgarian so they do teach it okay but none of your studies will be conducted in Bulgarian at all some of the professors even actually study it in the UK and have done training courses in the UK as well one of my internal met professors he did a few years in the University of Manchester and one of my biology professors she actually studied at the University of Cambridge okay cool so the most of the teaching he said is done in English but he have learned with learning as a course as a component of it yes and I imagine it's similar in like Prague and Romania and stuff yes I know it's the same in Romania yeah I'm not sure about Prague okay by imagine this is literally available on their website and he said if you got the GMC website you find the link of all the universities where they recognize the qualification okay so at this point I've missed my offer I'm feeling sad but I realise that actually I've got medicine in Europe as an option presumably I do kind of need to be able to pay that ¬£6000 plus the ¬£5000 yes that's one of the negative points which is that you have to solve fun your studies usually parents help out with this if not there are a few students who try to come back to the UK as often as possible to fund their studies by doing jobs I know one of my friends he works at call centers when he's back in the UK a few of my other friends they already have previous degrees such as pharmacy and biomed and they can just come back and do local jobs so there are ways of funding your degree other than getting alone and at the end of the day you'll be alone free as well so yeah that's a good cool so okay and then so you've run this agency and usually you were saying it's you and a bunch of other students yes what's the deal with the agency so the deal with the agency is that there are other agencies as well that do the work that we do where which is basically to help students apply abroad help with the application process help with the legal staff help with the entrance exam help with settling in and relocating to Bulgaria and the problem with other agencies is that they usually tend to overcharge students and they don't really provide the right services and us as medical students we recognize this quite early on and we said you know what this isn't fair we want to actually help students rather than them getting overcharged like we did when we were applying so we decided because we learned the application process we learned how everything is done yeah we made the right contacts and now we can actually help other students who are applying rather than them getting overcharged and you know going through an agency that might not hope the best okay do most people use an agency yes okay because it's it can't be quite over hassle applying abroad and it can't put people off applying abroad all together okay because as I said the mainly it's the legal stuff done and dealing with that can be a bit over hassle dealing with the entrance exam just you know knowing that you have an agency to back you and give you the right resources the right information is always useful okay so I'm in this position I'm a 17 year old student 18 miss my offer I then approach your agency how much would you charge me why should I approach you particular and I'm not the other ones and what do you offer me so when you come to us we have two separate packages that we offer the basic package and an advanced package the basic package only deals with the application process and the advanced package deals with everything from start to finish so we will help you with the application process we will help you with the relocation entrance exam we'll help you during your studies because we will be there we have all the resources for each year of study we haven't provided that and after you're degree and because by that time we would have already you know applied for job yeah no exactly the expertise in that area had the expertise in that exactly so we can help with everything from start to finish how much do these packages cost they roughly cost around the advanced package cost around 1200 pounds although this can change depending on the time of year how busy we get and because after the results day we do get very busy so it's best to apply as early as possible to make sure that you secure the best price for our services okay and the basic package the basic package is around 800 pounds okay so let's say I pay the 1200 pounds and then I don't get in it's that is that a thing people not get into these universities so you don't pay the 1200 altogether pay a 500 pound deposit beforehand before the application process starts that will cover you legal costs and this it will be as a security deposit for us to actually do the work for you okay and then after you actually get into the university is when you pay the majority of the feet so if you don't get in it's not like it's not a total loss yeah and we will help you then apply to a different university if you don't get into the university of your first choice okay okay so how how competitive is it like for like let's say you're a university let's say I've got like these and sees that A level and I've missed all my offers that I didn't get any offers yeah but do I realistically start a challenge of getting yes definitely 100% their students who apply with C grades and they definitely get in okay when I was applying there were students who were alongside me who really did not have any opportunity to study medicine in the okay but they still managed to get in as well because it really depends on how well you perform in the entrance exam rather than how well you did in your A level okay but first of you for my university they don't have any minimum grade requirements they just really focus on the entrance exam okay but surely there's some kind of correlation that like the sort of students that get D's at A level is probably not going to perform as well as an A star student of course of course definitely and there is that correlation and students some students do not get in because they only pick the top students in the rankings but then there is a waiting list as well and many students after actually reconsidering in September let's say they say you know what I'm going to take a gap here and I'm going to try again in the UK so because of that a lot of students actually don't take their place and that gives the space for other students to take those places other than that because there are so many universities available and if you don't get into one you'll definitely get into another okay is there so it's it sounds like what you're saying right now is that you can have the worst results in the UK and obviously not going to matter something so it's quite competitive here but someone in Europe will take you yes is that probably fair to say I believe so because there are universities which are more competitive than the other because they're in a nice city like my sort of implodive is more competitive than another city which is a bit further away a bit smaller like let's say pleaven or there's another called tracking medical university which is in situated in the best of locations which also make it as competitive and because of that they're entrances more easier there as well okay so I think we've covered most of the ground in terms of like hopefully if someone sees this video they will now know that studying in Europe is an option presumably there is like lots more written stuff I will put links in the video description and wherever you're watching this and on your website there's going to be more information and you're saying that most students do use an agency yes so you know the reason we're having this conversation is because you want to plug your thing but we want to have the same university as far enough to appreciate the hustle but hopefully we've provided enough information for people to realise that this is an option yes definitely albeit you do have to be able to pay the annual fee and also the agency fee and all all this kind of stuff which it discriminates and that really gets students from learning backgrounds but you know like unfortunately yeah yeah it's a bit of a problem but yeah hopefully with we're seeing a rise in medical students that are playing abroad because they are so focused on you know becoming a doctor yeah and they do tend to find ways to fund the degree okay so one thing I'm curious of so everyone has this view that medicine is supposed to be hard and intellectually demanding yeah and that's partly why the great boundaries in the UK are quite high it's quite competitive if you get season these at a level you're not going to get it to the UK yes do you think that someone would season these at a level would make a good doctor so as you said is intellectually demanding which is why even though the entrance might be easy the course is not at all it's the same as it would be in the UK and that is why if somebody does get into the university they still have to keep up with the workload you have to still you know work really hard especially if you do get season these at a level yeah because as you said it will be more challenging for those students than those that have A's and yes thus but personally I've seen students with A's and A's stars and because they're more confident in their abilities yeah it turns into overconfidence and then they're the ones that end up failing rather than the students that have season these and you know they work harder than the other students and they actually make it through okay so I suppose yeah so I suppose it's not a case of you just kind of pay some money than you have many degrees you might have a rigorous thing and ultimately you do have to pass the exam so you have to deal with your doctor and whether you came and it comes along that'll add some evidence exactly you know you know which is why you came really is coming along in the first place to actually standardize all doctors because at the moment the only people that have to sit in exam is people that are coming from outside of Europe yeah and that really meant that students from the UK and Europe if they non-issue was not up to scratch then they wouldn't really have any tests to actually prove that however now whether you okay MLA it's going to be for UK students your European students and international students alike so everyone has to sit that exam everyone has to show and prove themselves yeah so it's not a case of oh I've got bad grades I'll just get into medicinal just become a doctor without actually putting any work in but you you have to put the work in regardless okay yeah that makes sense because that was something I was I was thinking about that yeah it does yeah because it's it seems a bit weird that it seems like a dream come true like you know yeah I'll just go I'll just place some money and something I've got to make it very but it's not really like that okay and many people are put off by that thinking that the degree would be worth less because they're going abroad but that's not the case it's recognized by the GMC you can find the university on the GMC website they've got a whole list of universities that they recognize yeah and because of that and the reason they do that is because they know that the course is going to be as great legit yeah exactly okay if you had your time again and let's say you got an offer in the UK would you like do you wish you got a medical school in the UK or are you quite happy where you're on? personally I actually don't okay and that's mainly because the living costs are solo in Bulgaria then I can get more for my money and I can actually enjoy my time at university more than I think I would when I if I took a place in the UK that's because I'm comparing with my friends who are actually studying in the UK and they're always broke yeah like for example going to the cinema because like four or five pounds compared to here where that would be like half a ticket price so and there's a lot to do in Bulgaria as well it's right next to Greece and Turkey so during our weekend and breaks it's literally just a bus right away to go to Istanbul yeah or to and passing a leaky which is increase so we've got great student life then because of that I don't really think I would take a place in the UK okay that seems pretty cool alright I think that covers most of the things you wanted to talk about so just to recap I miss out on my offer I don't get any offers I for the most part I have the option of contacting an agency such as yours I don't have to but it's a bit more effort I suppose kind of like a morbid broker like you can fill out all the forms yourself is like a real pain in the bomb is like you'd rather get someone to do for you like and if you're paying you know 40,000 pounds of of course of six years what is one pound or two hundred pounds of application stage not really just to obviously just permanency against people from low and combat grounds it is what it is we can't cure inequality at this stage you know you know the medical application process that's true then I go through an agency with myself a each university in Europe has a tone entrance exam so I just kind of work out how to do well in that entrance exam I have to if I want to apply that year I have to do a very rapid turnaround I've got to work my else off presumably for a few weeks to you know get the grades for this entrance exam yes and once we're there within a few weeks you go all right let's move to Bulgaria find a house like accommodation wise does the university solve that out like how does that work so accommodation wise majority of the students tend to go for private apartments because they are cheap yeah and they're closer to the university campus the university does provide accommodation student dorms but they're not really that nice because you have to share them with another person it's just a small room with two beds and a fridge that's it that's what you get and but it is quite cheap it's like 70 euros a month for that okay if you're really on a budget you're really on a budget you've got that but if you want to go for something a bit more luxurious you can get a nice flat and because so many students are going to Bulgaria there is a lot of investment that is going on there right now with a new buildings being built especially for students with one bedroom two bedroom apartments so even if you want to share with someone you can get a 500 euro two bedroom apartment and share that between two people okay so now we're living in Bulgaria we're starting medicine for six years for two years generally our pre-ethnicals and then you have three or three years of clinical and then you're finally you're just kind of like if one where you're working in hospital you have to stuff like that and then at that point you have the option of applying to the UK for F2 yes but we're kind of not sure what the full details of that are going to be six years down the line because of the UK and the land because of how things are going to work so I think at the moment it's not part of the same process as the F1 as our F1s do but I imagine once the UK and that is standardized there's things that are going to change things are going to change so we don't really know about that so I guess that's not really something to be worrying about at this stage the main thing is your degree will be accepted so at the end of the day because you're going to have to do the UK MLA whether you're a UK student or in national student you shouldn't worry about your job prospects later on you will you you yeah somewhere you'll feel you'll find your job somewhere at the UK if you want to come back yeah cool it certainly will be a lot to not just a UK to be honest you can practice medicine anywhere in Europe apart from because of course the UK is going to have the UK MLA but and in the rest of Europe you can work without passing any entrance exams or anything like that so the degree is accepted all throughout the EU and then of course if you want to go to US you can do the US MLA yeah there's lots of options okay that's
