## Transcript
 Hey guys, welcome back to the channel. If you knew here my name is Ali and I've just graduated from studying medicine at Cambridge University and from tomorrow I'm gonna be starting my life as a junior doctor still working in Cambridge because I just love the place and I never want to leave So this video is gonna be a quick little channel update. I have been on YouTube now for about a year and from tomorrow It denotes and a season two of the content of this channel because everything is gonna change because I'm no longer a student So in this video, I'll just be describing various things and there's gonna be timestamps in the description below So you can skip around the video if you feel like it. So firstly, I want to say a big thank you to you for watching these videos And for subscribing to the channel and for following the Instagram and sending messages and emails and all that stuff We are now on almost 50,000 subscribers and like I remember a few a few months ago when we were on 5,000 subscribers and that number seemed like huge But now 50,000 is just pretty like unfathomable I've no idea how we got here I just somehow the study with me videos and The video about my iPad seemed to be doing really well And that loads of people are just kind of funneled into into subscribing, which is really fantastic So again, thank you so much from bottom I heart without you guys. I wouldn't be having this kind of thing as a As a sort of side project semi kind of career It's been really fun. It's been one of the most fun things I've done in my final year of med school And I'm really looking forward to continue to make hopefully good content for you guys as the years progress and as I go further and further into this whole thing about being a doctor So yeah, thank you again, and if you haven't subscribed you there's still time you can click the button down below if you feel like it on that No, I'm gonna be doing a 50K subscribers Q&A so if you have any questions please leave a comment down below or a message to me on Instagram or my details will be on screen and linked in the description below So if you have any questions Please post the below and I will do my best to get through as many as I possibly can or do like a rapid fire Q&A sort of thing cool So let's talk about content now and the content is gonna keep coming a few different types of content that I'm planning to make firstly vlogs vlogs about life as a junior doctor. I think it would be really interesting to document the journey and actually if you look all the way back to the very first video I made on Like a year ago when I was on an active. I said that kind of the main purpose of doing YouTube for this this past year was in preparation for Logging life as a junior doctor. I think it'll be quite interesting, you know the first night shift first time breaking bad news This I generally day-to-day what goes on as as a doctor in the UK I think it'll be interesting so I'll be making videos about that as we go along before that However, I've still got about five or six of vlogs maybe even more from my time as a medical student And this is all quite exciting stuff like we went to Singapore for free to present at a conference then went to Bali as a trip to Grenada That went with my family and then we've got the graduation stuff so graduation ball and graduation day So there is gonna be like a time lag between stuff that happens on the channel A vlog wise and stuff that happens in real life. I think this is gonna be a good thing because vlogging life as a junior doctor And talking about my experiences and if I ever kind of talk about patients that I've seen good for there to be this uncertainty between when something actually happened Because now that I'm gonna be starting as a doctor I do have to be very very careful of confidentiality and professionalism and all this stuff that goes into being a doctor and being like a trusted health professional So yeah big time delay between vlog happening in real life and vlog happening on on video But hopefully we should be uploading at a very regular rate fingers crossed second later I want to be making a lot more educational content So this is gonna be firstly quite a lot of very niche stuff aimed specifically at medical students This is one of those things like I know the subscriber base has now expanded a lot beyond just medical students But still that was kind of the core audience That is where I feel like in genuinely at the most value because I've filmed so many videos interviewing me and a lot of my friends About how to survive medical school stuff like you know the academic foundation application How to get publications how to prepare for oscues how to work on the wards all that stuff is gonna be fairly irrelevant to anyone But medical students but still that's gonna be one strand of the educational content on this channel and we'll probably do One of those I a certain day of the week so that if you're not a medical student or don't care about that sort of stuff You just don't have to watch the video every one day because it'll be pretty irrelevant here Secondly on the educational side I still do have a few things that I want to say about general study tips which would apply to university and secondary school students Or pretty much anyone doing any sort of learning and I also got a few videos prepared about I productivity tips and and morning routines and sleep and all this sort of stuff that goes into being a healthy and happy and productive Student just or any kind of learner generally so that'll be hopefully coming along and thirdly I want to tie and have education more in with tech so like my video about how I made notes and the iPad I did pretty well and I really enjoyed making it so I kind of want to make similar things like that So for example, maybe some videos about productivity apps that I use in my iPhone I'd pad my book I'm a big apple fan boy or you know stuff that bridges this education and a text fear Actually on that note. I do want to be making a lot more tech videos Reviews of stuff that I've been using for ages that I think I have an an interesting perspective on I don't think I'd be very good at just kind of reviewing tech with benchmarks and all the stuff that like the other incredible tech YouTube is do but I think on the in the sphere of kind of student life or daughter life or productivity I think I'll be able to offer something fresh maybe unique in terms of type reviews So that is going to be another sort of strand of stuff on this channel So as you've probably gathered if you're still watching this. Thank you very much I don't really know what what that what to focus down on everyone says that when you're on YouTube you should be focusing down on you know one particular thing But I am going to politely ignore that advice going to be making really niche videos for medical students that are going to be totally irrelevant to everyone else But also hopefully some general purpose videos about tech about how I use my Mac or stuff like that Oh and of course there's going to be vlogs about that adult life I filmed loads about moving into this house and setting up my desk and gonna do a new desk on a video because that was really So just in general this channel is going to be stuff that I think will help you guys but also And of vlogs of what it's like to now be an adult to now be a doctor working in the UK and on that Now in terms of content I would really love to get your suggestions on what sort of content that I should make What kind of content that you guys would be interested in if you leave any kind of comment I physically cannot respond to every comment on YouTube I do still try and reply to every Instagram DM so people for it to message me on there But if you do have any suggestions for what sort of content I can make I've got a long Ever expanding list of videos to make on this new app that I've discovered called things She'll talk about in another video. It's really good So I've got this long list of stuff that I'm hopefully going to be kind of making as life progresses over the next year or so And thirdly because I haven't done a monthly favorite video for this month and I kind of feel bad about that I'm just going to do a quick monthly favorite thing Firstly, Ikea been taking like so many trips that Ikea to help like buy stuff for this house To build furniture or all of that kind of thing and secondly I've been listening to the wise man's fear which is the second book of the Kingkiller Chronicles by Patrick Rothfuss The other day I went to Manchester for a wedding and that was like a seven-hour drive there and back And just kind of listen to this audiobook the whole time and it made the drive absolutely incredible This is not audible. It's kind of audible. There's a link below and if you do I get like two quid commission So if you fancy signing up for a free trial of audible which is run by Amazon you can click the link below But those are probably my two only monthly favorites for this month Ikea and audible because I've just been focusing on sorting stuff for this house finally one last thing that I've been doing is I've just I filmed an edited like a 75 video series about how to do well in the B-MAT which is the biomedical admissions test I've been running a company called six med for the last five six years and been teaching students I in physical classrooms across the UK Singapore the Netherlands about how to do well in this exam So because I'm now going to be a doctor and I don't really have time to teach in person anymore I've put every single thing I know online into this online video course There'll be a link in the description below. Yes, it will cost money and afraid but it'll be free of charged anyone from like any Financial difficulties anything like that so there's loads more information in the link down below But yeah, that has been kind of taking up my life for the last two weeks But now that's all finished. So hopefully more vlogs coming your way and more hopefully I think it's crossed a good content. So yeah, let's end the video there again from the bottom my heart Thank you so much for supporting this channel for subscribing for watching the videos it really means a lot And thank you to everyone who's message me by email who's signed up to my email He's like thank you or message me on Instagram saying thank you It's just been an incredible experience being on YouTube for this last year and I cannot wait for it to continue and Yeah, I'm just kind of Folding up all of my other little side projects because I really want to focus on just pretty much cranking out videos on YouTube Because it's really really fun and seems to be going down quite well So thank you very much for watching if you liked the video please give it a thumbs up if you haven't subscribed to the channel yet Please consider doing so have a lovely day And I will see you in the next video. Goodbye You
