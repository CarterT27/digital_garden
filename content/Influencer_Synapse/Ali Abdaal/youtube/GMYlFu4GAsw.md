## Transcript

I'm a junior doctor working in Cambridge and in this video I'm talking to another fellow junior doctor who is one year senior to me. His name is Mohammed and he goes by that medic on YouTube He makes videos about life as a doctor as well and we had a conversation that lasted about 15 minutes about tips for how to be a good junior doctor How to be a good F1 which means the first year of being a doctor. So I was asking him some questions and he was giving me some really useful advice Combined with sharing some of our experiences about what life on the job has been like so far So yeah, if you want you can catch this whole episode in audio format on the podcast at intercourse.fm Then you'll be in the description below and I'll leave links to my home on youtube channel and his Instagram So you can check those out but without further ado here is the conversation between me and my mother ii that medic Which is a very brandable name like I get a bit like annoyed every time I have to like spell out my youtube channel's name because there's no easy way of like you know Never mind here is here is the conversation So hey Mohammed welcome welcome to the podcast welcome to the channel Depending on where people are watching this. Thank you very much. Thanks for having me know that thank you for Thank you for coming on can you just give us a quick intro to who you are and and what you do so my name is Mohammed I am a doctor or working in London at the moment I'm a second year foundation doctor So I've had a year and a bit experience and I also make films on YouTube medicine travel Lysa the whole lot with bit hip hop Yeah, so I actually discovered your channel sort of back when I was first starting YouTube and like the editing when you're videos was just absolutely extraordinary like Like if you guys haven't seen My Hamas videos he's that medic on YouTube. I'll link all the stuff in the show notes and in the video description But like somehow you managed to film tons and tons of footage Not all your five years of medical school then you edited them all to make like you know highlight rules for each year So that's that was just pretty awesome, but in this little podcast episode in this video We're gonna talk about you giving me advice on how to be a good doctor absolutely because I'm in my first year of being a junior doctor You're in your second so you've done kind of the first year and you've kind of been through it So let's just jump into it. What sort of what are your top tips for being a junior doctor being an F1? Okay, so my top tip for being an F1 hands down is to be vigilant and to learn from your mistakes That's the only thing that's going to help you through your time is Okay, well, what do you can you can you elaborate? I should surely everyone would just I would do that by default or have you seen cases where that's not really happened So it's actually quite difficult to Because you're kind of running through your time as a doctor from the first person It's very difficult to see what you're doing and whether you're doing it right and a lot of the time So you just sort of do what's instinctively right and it's difficult to see that from a third perspective And it's sometimes important to look at it from a third perspective and to be vigilant and see Actually, it's the best way to do it. It's the best kind of way. I could have gone about certain situations Okay, so would you kind of analyze your own actions or would you ask someone else to sort of give you feedback like how does that work in practice? Exactly, so as a junior doctor as an F1 you are the most inexperienced doctor in the hospital So everyone is more experienced than you in everyone can give you advice So that's from nurses who have spent more time in clinics and that's from doctors and in whoever Whichever healthcare professional is around you? So it's very important that you seek feedback and the foundation program at the moment encourages you to do that as by You know reflecting on different cases and having case-based discussions and asking people to evaluate how you are as a doctor as a professional And it's very important that you do seek feedback Either actively or through this foundation program. Okay, because it's interesting you say that that that was something I was thinking about like yesterday while I was at work because there was there was like half an hour of downtime And in that time I was kind of thinking it would be nice if I could ask kind of the registrar or the CT2 or whatever To you know, just give me tips on you know what I could be doing differently and I guess people are generally Reluctant to criticize I suppose if if from my perspective if I was kind of actively being open to it So like look I want to be a better doctor what would you You know what sort of tips have you got what should I be doing differently? I suppose they probably appreciate that Absolutely and I think British people just as they're kind of just a natural kind of personality trait We're very bad at giving people compliments. We're very bad at receiving compliments and we're also bad at criticizing people And then also receiving criticism so in terms of feedback We're just really bad at it entirely So just I think it just comes down to the fact that if you are open to that idea And you ask for it and you seek it and you also have to kind of seek it from the right person as well It might be a registrar that you kind of have a better relationship with who you can ask more kind of open questions to And they would also feel comfortable giving you quite frank feedback Okay, so it's also about who you kind of seek advice from got it that makes sense of point number one get feedback So let's it feedback and actively actively working it So you're an F2 so presumably you now have F1's kind of sort of underneath you So what makes a good F1 and like what's the ideal F1 that you'd like to have as your as your minion So I think with a lot of medicine Your face with a problem and then you have to find a solution to it So it could either be a medical condition and then you have to find the treatment or the right investigations to go about it A lot of the questions that F1's usually have they can find the own answer to By doing a bit of research and hoping a book or kind of going on some trusted internet websites to find out which Investigation is best suited but sometimes the easier option is to just to ask So depending on the situation a good F1 wears sort of seek advice but also suggest solution Okay, and I think that's the best way to learn Okay, okay, yeah, that's what it makes sense because I can I can remember these past few weeks I've had so many questions where I've been thinking of sending a WhatsApp message to a registrar and and asking what the answer is But then I kind of think that okay, well, maybe the busy maybe they won't reply so then I find I find the answer myself or or give a suggestion and then I kind of what's her being like? Okay, I think we should be giving 1.2 grams of of curmocks a club is that legit? And then at some point they're replying with a yes, and I think that's a lot easier for them rather than giving me instructions and also you learn Yeah, so I'll give an example which was quite memorable to me so we had a patient who had Kind of an episode of leg shaking overnight The easy thing to do with to say call the registrar or my SHO and say look My patients doing this what should I do so that's probably what's sort of expected of you In that situation you've noticed something that's abnormal and then you've escalated up But I think a good F1 would kind of go to the patient take a history doing examination Think about what possibly could be going on here come up with a list of differentials and then when you speak to your registrar You've got a possible kind of differential and you've got more information about what's going on If you want to take a step further you can say look I think it's this And this is what I think we should do what do you think and I think that's probably the limit of where an F1 should be going to And as you get more confident and you become an SHO which is a senior house officer, which is your second year on you can start initiating certain Management on your own Okay, okay, so point number one So let's defeat back act on it and point number two and have in a way take the initiative when when you're asking asking for stuff Offer a offer a default option and then they can correct you if you're wrong Absolutely, then just you know asking the question. I'm asking the question. Okay Have you made any like if you if you want my talking any of these sort of big mistakes during your time as an F1 and how did you deal with them? Absolutely, I think we've all made mistakes and I'm quite happy to talk about them So the mistakes that I've personally made have come when I've been rushed Okay, when I haven't really thought something through so it's always a situation where I'm on call I'm late for handover. The nurse is really kind of They're asking something of me. I don't have enough time to do it So now I do if I do a half-hearted job that's when you make mistakes and they often get picked up by other people So the nurses administer it and get or the patient themselves or that's sort of thing So one of the things I made was Dosing war for him so we had a patient on the surgical ward who was in with jaundice Which is essentially the end of him if you're skin due to kind of liver dysfunction At that point I was trying to do so war for him and I just prescribed her usual war for a day switch for 80% of kind of people that would be okay But if I'd been more vigilant I would have thought and if I had more time I would have thought to look at the liver function And the rest of her blood results and her investigations and then maybe it would have picked up the fact that actually Her liver function wasn't wasn't doing to her well So if I gave her a usual war for a dose how iron are so how easy he actually is to bleed would be super high And that would be dangerous so luckily that was picked up by my S.H.O Who sort of took me to the side and said you know When you're dacing more friend is it there's simple F1 task but in certain cases You need to kind of think about other things maybe look at liver function etc Okay Yeah, so like there was a mistake I made fairly early on as well Which as you know as you said was was down to being rushed and and not really knowing what was going on So this was kind of a medication error where I discharged a patient on three different kind of blood thinning medications Which they were on in hospital but I didn't realise there was a note saying that one of them should be stopped Then because there were so many patients on the board that day and the pharmacist didn't get in a rug get around to checking the drugs I put them in on as like self-check to help the patient go home better because I didn't really know what that meant and I was asking for it so all these different things lined up To the point where this wasn't picked up and then when it was found out then the registrar took me aside and he's kind of explained that yeah This this is what happened Partly you know, it's you know, so it's afforded the system that you know these all these checks were in place But you know the circumstances meant that they they just didn't happen on the day So I suppose like have you if you've only tips for avoid like you know if you do if you are you know You've got loads of patients you don't have much time. How do you avoid making these sorts of mistakes So my advice would probably be not be reciprocated by the bed managers who are in charge of how the bed's work But your job as a doctor isn't to manage the bed isn't to get this patient out of hospital It's to ensure the safety of the patient and to ensure that they receive the medical care that they they are they rightfully need So if You If by trying to discharge a patient on the same day that sort of compromises their care or their safety then I would say to avoid it And from the patient side of things it's not the most comfortable thing to stay another night in hospital But I'm sure they'd rather that than be on the wrong medications and that would really annoy the bed managers if they heard me say that But being rushed You make errors and that's they've done several audits and several amounts of research and it always shows that People make mistakes when they're rushed and when they're being pressured to do things. Okay, so I suppose we're saying that It's not really our job as it were to worry about what the bed situation is Our job is to worry is to you know, we are in charge of the care of the person at hand and Yeah, there's a lot of other pressures, but you know what the patients safety is mine Of one priority and everything else comes secondary to that whether it's you know the bed crisis or or anything else absolutely Okay, um, have you got any tips for how to be friendly with nurses and How to deal with that side of the doctor pay the the doctor nurse relationship. Okay, so First rule. Yeah, nurses run hospitals doctors just work in a hospital Nurses run the hospital nurses are the ones that spend every single minute of the day with the with the patients and they know them very well So the nurses are very important in your role as a doctor and It all comes down to the fact that everyone has their roles and everyone should know what their role is But just because the nurses are in charge of the kind of day-to-day care It comes and and they do take on a lot of responsibility in ensuring certain tasks are done and a lot of the kind of doctors role is Trying to get those tasks to be done by the nurses But I guess it comes down to how you approach that situation So the way I sort of kind of pose it is I always like to kind of give the nurses an update about what's going on and I'll rush now behind doing certain tasks And in doing so you involve them in the in the conversation about what's going on with the care of the patient And they always do kind of sometimes give you a bit of feedback sometimes say oh, that's actually a good idea Or maybe we should do this and this and then it's you then it's entirely up to you whether you listen to that or not But I think involving them in sort of the conversation given them updates about what's going on and then and then posing the tasks as sort of a kind of A management planning making them ninscore part of it is the best way to approach it. Oh Okay, that's interesting because like at the moment on our ward rounds for for the most part We we we we see the patient we write it into the notes on the computer system and then we go on to the next patient Are you saying there is maybe something to be said for you know When when I've got a bit of time because the consultant's gone away to clean him or whatever Just going up to the nurses and being like, okay, right here's an update This is what we're doing about mr seven certain absolutely that's exactly what I do so the net at the consultant comes in As these are all the patients and then rushes off to clinic and then after that I then I do another hand over to the nurses looking after the patient and also sometimes to the a hedge a head sister Oh, okay, so I I feel that's the best way to do it Okay, that makes sense and then it's also about the little things it's like being married So I have a lot of experience that I don't know in experience and being married But it's also a little about the little things so things like can we get a bladder scan? You can grab the bladder scanner and it's like a gun you put you kind of press a lever and then you get that Oh, I've literally never done a bladder scan. It's really easy. It's honestly super easy and you should need to pick up the bladder scanner and do it yourself And those little things nurses do notice or when you kind of When you kind of do a cannula or whatever and use that silver tray kind of wiping it down and then putting it to the side Kind of saves them another job and they notice these little things and then that does eventually get them on your side Oh, sick, thanks a heart and also compliment Okay, yeah, because you said we British are bad at giving compliments. Yes. Absolutely. Okay, and just in general You want to get to know the team that you're going to spend it be spending a lot of time with So try to get to know their story try to get to know their interests So like we've got to running Jake with the nurses at the moment who love friends. I know I love friends So I greet the nurse every day by saying how you do So it's just that bad that these little things having a little bit of cancer and just kind of be be friends really all right Awesome, so we've talked about You know actively listening feedback taking advice from me We've talked about dealing with nurses and just being friendly in general We've talked about how to avoid making mistakes one last thing From next week. I've got my first crop of night shift For like five days in a row. Have you gone new tips for dealing with nights? Yes, so first step get yourself a set of blackout curtains Oh, I've got blackout curtains very very important. Yeah, so that's the first thing I did the next thing is You need to shift your sort of kind of sleep cycle How good are you at sleeping? It varies. I tend to read a lot before going to bed and then I'm your tired. So so I would spend Sort of after work just stay up the entire night and then that way you're so tired that you sleep the entire time through the day And then that way you've kind of readjusted to night shift. Well as in on the first day on the day before Yeah, that night exactly. Oh, that's fine. I could do something you can do that. Is that please? And then the other thing is that as you go through your night shift the first thing you'll do is you'll go to hand over and then you'll get a list of jobs to do First thing you do is you prioritize them So you get the patient reviews out the way first for the sick patients Then you sort of do the time critical medications and the other things x-ray ctpa is all the other scans that you need to chase And then you can do things like rewriting a drug chart or something for six a.m. or kind of preparing a TTA or whatever I'll see you have to do So the thing that a lot of people kind of struggle with is that night is that because you're out of hours They're unless doctors around But also as the night on called doctor you're only Responsibility really is to do the the critical stuff so only review the patients that need Really really to be reviewed so I remember getting called but a sodium that was always 1314 which is really low dangerously low if it was an acute episode But it was it was like that forever and the nurse called me in the middle of the night was like His so James won 13. I was each like oh my god like what's his blood pressure trying to find out if if this patient's all right Then I logs on to a computer a fan that it always been like that for three years So it's that sort of thing that kind of with experience you build up a sense of This job doesn't really need to be done now and By doing that You can then filter out all of the crap and just do The things that really need to be done overnight and I think the best thing to do is to actually go through your list with an SHO Or someone with more experience than you and sort of go through it and be like actually In your opinion which ones do you think if I need to do first and you might already know But it's actually kind of worth just getting that sort of secondary feedback or a kind of second pair of eyes to look at your list And in your head you could be like oh yeah, I agree. I agree. I agree. Oh actually I didn't realize that was so important and then and then you'll find out Okay, brilliant. That makes sense. I will keep those in mind when when starting the first time and I'll send you a text if I absolutely have any if you need me All right well, thank you very much for coming on on the channel. Thank you. There's been a pleasure And we've got we've done a video on your channel where we're talking about like comparing Kings college London or rather GKT men's cooler Kings versus Cambridge so you guys might like to check that out if you if you Absolutely absolutely all right, so thanks and I'll see you later All right, so that was the conversation. Thank you very much for watching so actually listening I hope you gained something from that I know I certainly did and I got lots of actionable tips that I am taking forward actively now In the remaining time that I've got as an FY1 junior doctor so thanks for watching if you liked the video please give it a thumbs up If you haven't subscribed to the channel please consider doing so and have a look at my home as a channel as well Where we've done a video comparing Cambridge and Kings as far as medical schools go so you can watch that if that floats your boat But otherwise yeah, thanks.
