## Transcript
 Hey guys welcome back to the channel. Today's vlog is going to be all about the Pakistan society ball. Pakistan is an amazing university society that I've been part of for the last six years and honestly has has been the source of some of my greatest friends and friends that I know will be keeping for the rest of my life. So this whole kind of episode is kind of some footage that I filmed while Pakistan ball was happening. I happened to be singing on stages that day as well, so I'll include some bits of me singing, you know, trying to incorporate the whole music thing into this channel in a sort of slimy way. But yeah, we're going to start off with my brother coming in for the first time I think on the channel. Hi guys, welcome back to the vlog. If you're new here, my name's Tim Watt. I'm a graduate and we're at Cambridge Paxock Ball 2018. What, what do you want? I don't know, just like, I did, I haven't affected the vlog voice. Hey guys, welcome back to the vlog. Today is the day of the Cambridge Pakistan Society Ball. This is my six-year attending I was president in my third year of my VP in the second year. It's going to be a fun event. As many loads of people here, I think there are about 250 people in attendance, 35 people who've come down from Oxford, Oxford Islamic Society, Oxford Pakistan Society. I then run into my friend Saba, who's an Oxford medic and also has a YouTube channel, and we have a surprisingly awkward conversation on camera. Here we go. Hey, I'm close to the goal. How are you finding the ball? It's great. Good kind of it. Deep and juicy, interesting. We then sing the Pakistan National Anthem. This is actually a tradition that I started three years ago when I was president. Previously, we never sung the National Anthem at the ball, but India solved it. So I was like, you know, well, let's have some national pride guys, let's sing on National Anthem. So everybody, so on my early fifth year medic, we just kicked off Pakistan ball. It's looking to be an absolute cracker, a filter of the ball. You just have the National Anthem. As usual, none of us die aspirin, know the lyrics, but that's okay. Because all you have to do is stand up and put your hand on your chest and not approvingly. It's no more. I'll cut touch base in a moment. So that was one of my closest friends. Oh my, he's he's quite the character. But now, the moment you've all been waiting for, we've got some clips of myself and my friend Rupert singing perfect by Ed Sheeran at Pakistan ball. Here we go. So that was some of our performance of Perfect. We all did a mashup before called mashup where we sang a bit of Moana, a little bit of I'm yours, a bit of Canifield Love tonight, a bit of Black Hype peas, a bit of Petty Nazaramevite, Artifastlam, and we ended with Don't Stop Believing. I was that was really good fun. All in all, really fun performing with Rupert. You can see at the end of that song at the end of Perfect. The crowd absolutely loved that little kind of hand-holding thing we did for about five seconds. You can't do much more than holding hands on stage at Pakistan ball because then the crowd's gonna like have a stroke or something, but, you know, a little bit of hand-holding and, you know, this really gets some riled up. But yeah, really fun performing that. Now we've got various people that wanted to be on the vlog and actually some people that I forced to be on the vlog, one of whom you might recognise from, you know, he's a big famous YouTuber and they're just saying nice things about our performance and nice things about the ball generally. Hi guys, it's been here. You just missed the amazing performance I'm holding it at the end of vlog as well. People were singing a song like this. Thank you so much, I'm John Ball. We're on the live bar, we're on the third year, drop the shoot out, I gave it, I'm loving the ball and it's my outfit. Hello guys, my name is Hashshu, I'm Mehrab, I'm Zach, I'm a first year medit, I'm modeling from the Jokesworth, I'm currently in my gap year. First year LSEPP, and we think Ali Abdul's music performance was perfect. What's that man? I'm the he's I go to Oxford, I go to Oxford, I go to Oxford, I go to Oxford, and I'm finally at the end of the astonishing. It was truly a pleasure to be in the audience. This guy should be on Broadway. Truly the greatest performance of Paxwood Ball history. Thank you so much for wasting us with your theatrical present. Ali's performance was so good like you can see the emotional connection, everybody was loving it, everyone was singing a lot, and it was the servicemen to watch it. Hi, I'm Svega. I'm Svega. So I've been looking at my legs from Oxford and we've had all the way to Cambridge for all today. And we're really excited to be in Ali's long because we're going to be fans of YouTube channel. So I've had a lot of messages from people who are from ethnic minority backgrounds and are worried that I don't want to play to Cambridge because I know that it's mostly white. And yeah, Cambridge is mostly white and that's probably not going to change for the foreseeable future. Although they are working on it, the acts of departments really go the communications department is really good. But you know, it's it's stuff like Paxock and India sok and Bangladesh sok and Somali sok and there's all sorts of societies that you can get involved in whether you're an ethnic minority or not. So yeah, if you're looking for contact with ethnic minorities then there are loads of amazing societies that Cambridge that offer that. I don't think that alone should be a reason for not applying to Cambridge just my two cents on that front. So yeah, other than the performances at Paxwood Ball there's like a five course meal and there's performances that we had to coolly people this time round and then at the end there's always like a dance floor that opens up where everyone kind of gets involved. And after all that was over about 1 a.m. we all headed over to Christ's College where there was a big after party in their JCR and that was just full of loads and loads of Asians just like absolutely not going to be just sitting there and chatting which is quite nice. And now to complete this vlog we're going to cut to stuff that happened the following morning. All right, so it's the morning after Paxock Ball. We're hanging out in Pembroke College and we're coming here for brunch. This is like a traditional thing that after Paxock Ball all of our lot and all the Oxford we'll meet up at Pembroke Branch. Everyone here is looking refreshed. We've come to Pembroke Branch to revitalize ourselves with some good fodder and some saccharines trees. We're here for the waffles. Nothing cures a hangover from Paxock Ball. Like waffles at Pembroke Branch. It was a wonderful night. Most of us have recovered. It's been almost 12 hours since Ali and Rupa perform their tour to force on stage. And yet still in my head the haunting cries of the women in the crowd and they're wonderful singing or reverberating in my head. What an extraordinary performance. So yeah, I hope that give you a reasonable taste of what Paxock Ball is like. It's pretty much just a one big event in the year where you get 300 brown people in a room together and celebrating Pakistani culture and people doing performances and loads of good food. And yeah, it's generally quite a good time and it's good excuse to meet our friends from Oxford and LSE and other kind of universities that come up to Cambridge just for that purpose. So yeah, thanks very much for watching. If you liked the video please give it a thumbs up. If you haven't subscribed to the channel please consider doing so. Have a lovely day and I'll see you in the next video. Bye bye.
