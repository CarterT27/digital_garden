Welcome back to another episode of the 'Making an App' series. In this video, we talk about how we animated our design using Invision. Ben hopefully shows that it's reasonably straightforward.

## Transcript
 Hello everyone and welcome back to making an app. This is episode five in the last episode I'll be talking a little bit about how we start to make the prototype So the prototype allows us to quickly design our app and when it's done We'll be able to get quick feedback from people just to give us an idea of whether it's been good What works well whether the flow seems to transition well to the next step and the final step of our prototype is to bring it to life By creating animations, so when you click on a button it goes to a page that you expected to go to So from our app you can see that there are five main tabs at the bottom to the next step is to add these animations that we've been talking about And so we're going to use a program called Envision which is a free-to-use app as you can see I've created an account and I've uploaded our sketch Onto this program so that we can Link the various pages together a three things called hotspots What I will try to do today is just show you how we link the basic pages together So just to create a few animations and a few links between what we've created so far from the home Page you want to make several links so the links to the various sheets at the bottom as well as to add an operation So let's just go through the add an operation flow, which is the main part of our app So first the I'll click and drag one of these hotspots This immediately asked me where I want it to link to so from here I'll click to add an operation page one Once it's linked through last me what animation I want so for this one we're going to slide up from the bottom So we simply pick slider that's done so the next step is to let's follow this through So if I click shift and click this hotspot that I've now created so you can see that it takes me through to the first page of the operation list now on here The next step would be to go to next page for example So we're just going to run through the series of screens We have four screens in total Which go between each stage of adding an operation so each time I'm clicking and dragging across the next button And once I've done that I'll click through and it will run through to next page and at the very end once you've completed all the details for this operation We have this save an exit function and the idea is once you click this it will bring us a report card This is the first time I've used this in vision software and it's taken me about 15 minutes just to make a basic run through Using the designs that we've made. This has been surprisingly easy to use and in terms of making a prototype Then it seems like there's two major steps one is just to design what you think you'll look like You can even use something like PowerPoint or Microsoft paint if you need to just something to get your design on paper Next we have all these different slides that we can use and we just want to create these links between them So using this in vision software has been really really easy to use is literally a click and drag to create a button and once you click on that button You can link two pages together and the beauty of envision is we can download it through to our iPhone So you can actually test it using the device that you want to ultimately have it on So however you've seen how easy it is to actually make a prototype So the designing stage takes a bit more time But they actually are linking it up and making an animation out of it and really bring the whole thing to life It's very easy to do You can do it in an afternoon once you've downloaded made an account and learnt just basic functions of the software that you're using So thank you very much for watching. I hope you've enjoyed watching me fiddle around with in vision for the first time That leaves the next step which is just to code the thing so this we assume will take a lot longer and We'll involve a level of coding that I'm gonna be learning for the first time as well So stay tuned for the next video Where hopefully we'll go through some of the starting blocks for coding. Yeah, thank you very much for watching I hope you enjoyed it and we'll see you in the next episode. Bye You
