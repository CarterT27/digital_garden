Hey friends, this is just a quick video to announce my latest SkillShare class that's been released today called 'Learn Anything With Flashcards - The Ultimate Guide To Anki'! There are 42 lessons and hours of content to get you started and optimising your use of the app. For me, Anki has probably been the most useful and valuable app that I've used over the past few years and I want others to be able to get the same benefits that I achieved by discovering it.

## Transcript
 Hey friends, welcome back to the channel. This is a very quick announcement video to tell you about the launch of my brand new Skillshare class Called learn anything with flashcards the ultimate guide to Anke. You can access it right now for free by hitting the link in the video description And if you don't have a Skillshare account, that's fine. You can sign up for a free two-month trial of Skillshare by clicking the link in the video description And then once you've done that you can watch the entirety of this Anke class But you can also check out my other classes on how to study for exams and how to edit videos in final cut exactly like this one Flashcards are one of the best ways to learn anything because they incorporate active recall and space repetition in like a really nice fun way And those are the two most effective study techniques and Anke is one of the most popular flashcard apps Which hundreds of thousands of students around the world use to memorize large chunks of information so that we can Regurgitate it for exams But it's also quite helpful for learning other things like I'm using it for music theory and loads of people use Anke for learning languages It's a really popular app that's free and across any platform But it does have a bit of a learning curve and I know so many people who tried using Anke but then kind of gave up with it because they just didn't quite get the settings Rye or they weren't quite using it properly So that's kind of what we're aiming to teach you in this class It's a beginner's guide to using Anke along with like a lot of advanced stuff and a lot of bonus material So essentially the classes split up into four sections in section one We're going through the basics of Anke like the basic flashcards reverse flashcards closed lesions image occlusions and sort of the basic ways of making and Reviewing flashcards and Anke to kind of memorize stuff then in section two having covered the basics We're going over some demonstrations So I'll show you how I make flashcards from lectures from books and from videos and we'll talk about how to improve our flashcards to increase the utility over time Then in section three, we answer frequently asked questions So I posted on my Instagram story and hundreds of people sent in questions asking things like how long should a flashcard be? How do you avoid flashcard overload? How do you stay motivated to keep doing a flashcard every day? What information do you put on a flashcard? What do you not put on a flashcard? But also a lot of stuff like you know, do you use Anke instead of notion versus Anke instead of Google sheet or Anke versus Quizlet or you know How do I know which flashcard app to use so all of those questions are answered in section three then in section four We talk about optimizing up performance in Anke and how we can use tags add-ons and pre-made decks most crucially to supercharger and keep performance And the final section of the course is a bit of a bonus segment where we have interviews with other people other students from around the world who are using Anke really effectively For all sorts of different subjects and these people from around the world are showing their own tips on how you can get started with Anke and how to make the process of Studying with flashcards much more efficient and enjoyable all of that and more you can find in the Skillshare class link in the video description There's 42 videos in the proper section and then like load more in the bonus section The class runs over five hours. I think it's quite long You definitely don't need to watch it in one sitting and fact whatever recommends that if you're a beginner you only watch the first segment and then you start actually applying Anke And using flashcards for your own exams or whatever you want to learn because it's very easy to just kind of sit there and pass somebody absorb like five hours of a video content But not really get anything from it. So we don't really want that to happen with this class in the description I'll also put a load of other links to other YouTubers some of whom actually featured in the Skillshare class itself Links to other kind of getting started resources for Anke so if you don't want and you don't have to watch this Skillshare class But I think it's pretty good. We put a lot of work into it We've been working on it for the last like two months So this is like a culmination of effort from me and my team about how you can start using flashcards and how it kind of changes the game because it's like genuinely like discovering Anke He really did change the game for me in my medical career and meant that I had the time to do other stuff other than just kind of be bogged down by the struggles of doing medicine at Cambridge I had to get that in there. I have to get the cams from there somehow. Anyway, uh, I've rumbled on enough Check out that link in the video description. Thanks, and I'll see you in the next video. Bye You
