## Transcript
 Welcome to WWE DC! Hey guys, welcome back to the channel if you're new here at my name is Ali. I'm a junior doctor working in Cambridge And in this video, I'm gonna break down some of the most exciting features that are coming to the new iPad OS The Apple unveiled at this year's WWDC We're calling it iPad OS and I'd like to give you a first look and it seems like all the changes They're making to the iPad with iPad OS are essentially gearing towards making the iPad more of a replacement for your MacBook Yes, so yeah, I'm gonna be talking about some of the announcements that I'm personally most excited about and as usual There's gonna be timestamps in the video description and in a pinned comment and over here So you can skip around the video if you feel like it. Oh, it's awesome But now let's just get into it So firstly, one of the things they really went on about during the keynote and also splashed everywhere on the website Outwards is the fact that the new iPad OS has all these split screen features built into it I'll be honest the main reason I use split screen is when I'm in a lecture or in a class And I'm pretending to take notes on one window, but then I'm browsing red it or something in the other window So that's a kind of handy use for split screen is probably not quite the use case It had in mind and it's probably not quite the sort of thing that the new features help you out with What if I want to get back to that last app? Can we make that super easy answer as yes? I can just drag from the bottom and they fan out just like that Secondly, we're gonna finally be able to plug in external drives into the iPad That's right. You can now plug in a fun drive fun drive, external disk drives and SD cards all show up right in the files app This is absolutely next level like the reason that I can't use my iPad for photo editing or even for video I'm saying is because I'm very cheap and I got the 64 gigabyte version and there is no way I can edit raw photos on a 64 gig iPad or Video at all on a 64 gig iPad But now this one's really great too Sometimes when you're working with a camera you'd like to import directly into an app like light room and now you can That's gonna be absolutely game-changing and I think that's gonna mean that the iPad replaces my laptop for a lot of my photo editing Work flow Thirdly in the new iPad OS, they're apparently gonna be completely revamping the way that they do text editing Text editing is kind of a bit of a ball-acre on the iPad at the moment moving the cursor around to select stuff is a little bit Fiddly moving the cursor is easier than ever Just pick it up and drag it where you want it to go and they're revamping the text editing features That makes it more legit for actually writing stuff and not being a little bit frustrated every time you write Point number four in iPad OS this autumn they're gonna be introducing more keyboard shortcuts And this is one of the main facets of my personal productivity system like I think productivity is partly about having the right mindsets and the right principles And putting those in place But also it's about having the right tactics to efficiently do things and be able to save time and the problem that I've always had with the iPad and why I've never quite been able to Switching to it for everything is just the fact that almost everything I do on an iPad is a bit less efficient than doing the same thing on a MacBook But hopefully with the introduction of keyboard shortcuts this autumn that might become a bit closer to what Performance is like on a MacBook Pro in terms of efficiency of action economy of motion or this sort of stuff Big fan of keyboard shortcuts. I think more people should use keyboard shortcuts more often So another thing that I'm quite excited about is the fact that full desktop web browsing is coming to Safari Oh, it's awesome At the moment Safari counts as a mobile browser and this doesn't make any difference for the most part Unless you're doing something like trying to edit a website for example with ghost or wordpress or square space I use ghost at the moment and if I want to edit my post I can't do it to the extent that I'd be doing it on a desktop and so When iPad OS comes out in autumn It'll be a lot more possible to make website changes on the fly stuff like that In ultimately, there is the new side car feature that's being introduced to iPad OS and to Mac OS Catalina come autumn Now you can use your iPad as a second display for your Mac And there've been ways to do this in the past using things like do wear to it But it's never quite work perfectly to the point that I've always tried these things out and never really stuck to them I'm hoping that once this new side car feature gets added then I'll be able to take the MacBook take the iPad Pop it down in a library or in a coffee shop and get this really cool like vibe Where I'm like, you know doing stuff here doing stuff here and get this and feel like a bit more of a dawn a bit more of a boss for having these two displays Yeah And finally, apparently with the new iPad OS and with the new iOS You'll be able to connect two different pairs of AirPods to watch the same thing. We have all had a time Where we wanted to share a movie or a song with a friend now you can with just a tap You can both connect your AirPods to the same iPad and that's gonna be next level because you can be You know sitting on the sofa together or snuggling up in bed or whatever floats your boat Maybe sitting on an aeroplane and if you're watching the same thing, that's really cool It's not gonna be particularly useful for me at the moment because I don't have anyone to share such a an intimate experience with But perhaps one day, you know when I get married and I convince my future wife to get in a pair of AirPods We'll be able to have these like cute little date nights where we're births sitting on the sofa and watching something on an iPad Or like if we're on the train and going somewhere together and she's got a head resting on my shoulders and we got the iPad out and Watching an airport anyway, yeah That's another thing that I'm maybe looking forward to a little bit further down the line, but not quite just yeah So that was an overview of some of my favorite features that are coming to iPad OS this autumn I'm very excited. I use my iPad for absolutely everything I want everything not for video it's ain't not for further editing, but I'm hoping that it'll become more of a laptop replacement Once the new iPad OS comes out and as soon as it does and as soon as I've taken it around with it I will be right here giving my thoughts and unsolicited opinions about how the iPad fits into my life So thank you very much for watching the video Thank you all for coming and sharing the time with us If you liked the video, please give it a thumbs up if you haven't subscribed to the channel then please consider doing so Have a great week and I will see you in the next video. Goodbye. Thank you
