 Hey friends, welcome back to the channel. Today we are talking about five mistakes that procrastinate as make. These are mistakes that I've been making a lot when it comes to various things I'm procrastinating on and I thought I'd share them with you. The first one is not appreciating the difference between real procrastination and fake procrastination. So what is fake procrastination? Fake procrastination is where we think and we tell ourselves that we're procrastinating from something but actually what's just happening is that we are just simply prioritizing things a little bit differently. Now a lot of times people will be like, oh, you know, I want to start a YouTube channel but I keep procrastinating from it. But your only procrastinating from it is if you physically have the time to do it and if you actually want to do the thing and in that context you've got the time you want to do it at that point that's real procrastination. But if for example you're working full-time or you're full-time student and you know you want to exercise an hour a day and you want to spend three hours a day with your family and you know you want eight hours of sleep and you literally don't have any hours in your day to then start a YouTube channel. So that's just about prioritization rather than procrastination. And so what I find is that like I often tell to I often like weirdly tell myself I'm procrastinating as a way of sort of congratulating myself beating myself up. And it's kind of a bit pointless as it's just prioritization and the solution I found to this is it doesn't count as procrastination unless I have a block in my calendar for the thing. If I don't have a block in my calendar for the thing then great that's fine. I've chosen not to prioritize that in my life but as soon as I do have the block of time in my calendar I'll I eat go to the gym between six and seven PM and then I'm still choosing to not go to the gym even though I've made the time for it and that point that's real procrastination. So I think it's important to understand the difference between those two things so that we don't unnecessarily be ourselves up. Speaking of unnecessarily beating ourselves up that brings me on to mistake number two which is a mistake that again procrastination is tend to make including me which is that we have a tendency to beat ourselves up. For procrastination I've been doing a bunch of research on this for for the book that I'm writing it's actually like an evolutionary useful mechanism like what is procrastination procrastination is where we generally have a short term bias. We're not doing something that's going to be in a long term interest. We tend to do stuff that's short term better for us instead and this makes sense evolutionarily because like self-actualization you know working on this thing that's going to pay off ten years from now. In caveman days where you could be eaten by a tiger is not particularly helpful. Like our ancestors our evolutionary ancestors really have to optimize for being in the present moment and for the short term gains. If we beat ourselves up for doing this thing it's like this it's a very very natural phenomenon and actually procrastination is useful in that it allows us to conserve energy and to not spend that energy and time and effort and resources on things that might not necessarily be worth it to us. You know what I'm going to say I tend to make is just not recognize this and I think when I'm procrastinating that I am a bad person but what I found helpful to think about is that when I'm procrastinating it's fine it's fine this is just what my evolutionary past has kind of designed me to do. I can then choose to exert higher control over that by creating systems and various other things we're going to talk about in but I don't need to flagulate myself for it and I think mostly a big part of why procrastination is a struggle for so many of us including me is that we have this tendency to beat ourselves up and so I I try my best to try and avoid that even though it doesn't always work. All right mistake number three that we ask procrastinators make is that we press the try harder button. What is the try harder button? The try harder button is when we think okay I know I'm procrastinating from x and I just need to do it I just need to try harder I just need to be more disciplined I just I just need to dot dot where we put the onus on ourselves to put in the effort to do the thing I'm procrastinating from I don't know writing my book or whatever the solution oh I I just need to sit down and do it or I'm procrastinating from doing my essay that's due to weeks from now I just need to sit down and do it whenever I find myself saying I just need to dot dot and the answer to that is I need to try harder I need to press the try harder button shout out to my friend Neil Nanda for for the tip on there whenever I'm pressing the try harder button it's just not going to work again I'm sort of working against my evolutionary past I'm working against my human psychology to just think that I'm just going to try harder I think this applies to life in general like if your solution to a problem is you are just going to try harder that's not a sustainable way to be productive it's not a sustainable way to live and the solution to this is that instead of thinking that you personally or me personally are we're going to try harder the answer is that we think in terms of systems and that brings us to on to mistake number four which is to treat ourselves as humans it's going to sound weird but I think it's a mistake to treat ourselves as as people and we should in fact think of ourselves as systems when it comes to procrastination if we're trying to overcome procrastination what do I mean by this when we think of ourselves as humans we think oh as a human I can just put in more effort I can just put in more time I can just be more disciplined and we have all this stuff where we in a way put this expectation on ourselves that we are going to do more of the thing whereas if we don't think of ourselves as humans and instead we think of ourselves as machines I'm a cybernetic organism or systems it means that you know you can't just make a computer work twice as fast without changing something about the code without changing something about the system that it's operating in and so when I'm struggling with with procrastination let's say oh you know I've got this two hour block to go to the gym or one hour block to go to the gym and I'm not going to the gym oh I just need to do it that's not that's not the right approach the right approach is at least I found is to think okay what is the system that I can design around this to make it more likely than I'm going to do it because I'm not a human who can apply more effort I may system who if the coding of the system changes I can do the thing so when it comes to the gym for example you know finding a gym that's closer to me finding a gym that I enjoy going to finding a personal trainer finding an accountability buddy like Gordon my videographer who's also my gym buddy to be like right we're going to go to the gym at 730 tomorrow finding a way to track my workouts I use an app called strong and then I share photos of that screenshots of that on my Instagram which encourages me to keep on doing it I have a clear plan I know what I'm doing when I go to the gym these are all systems that you can put in place that I found helpful for putting in place I still don't go to the gym very often but the system's help and help reduce my procrastination I never think I just need to try harder and just me more discipline than just go to the gym because I know that's not a sustainable way of kind of actually doing this thing that I know I want to do that I know have made the time for but that I seem to be procrastinating from so moral of the story is think of yourself as a system not as a human trying design a system that makes it way easier for you to do the thing and not procrastinate from it rather than thinking that you just need to try harder you just need to be more disciplined the final mistake that we as procrastinate is tend to make that I fall into myself a lot is trying to push the boulder up the hill what do I mean by this if we are trying to do something that we fundamentally don't really want to do where it's not energizing for us it's not enjoyable it's not fun it's not interesting it doesn't feel meaningful but we think we have to do it or we should do it anyway that's like pushing a boulder up the hill it's very easy to procrastinate from things that we find a really boring really de-energizing really draining really pointless and I think the mistake is in thinking okay this thing is just boring by default sometimes work is just bad oh this subject I have to get through it is just intrinsically boring there's nothing I can do about it I just need to force myself to do it that's pushing the boulder up the hill it works some of the time but it's not a it's not a source of sustainable motivation and it's not a source for sustainable productivity whereby we can get things down while also having fun and living a nice life the solution that I found is whenever I find myself thinking oh this thing is just really boring and I just need to do it number one I think in terms of systems and number two I think how can I find a way to make the thing energizing how can I what what can I tweak about either the way I'm approaching the thing or about the task itself that will help it regenerate my energy rather than drain my energy what can I do to make this thing more enjoyable? One simple tip why I guess it's not particularly simple is the idea of gainification and if you want to hear more about the idea of gainification I've got this video over here which is how I tone my life into a video game which is eight principles the octalysis framework for how to make anything that you have to do that's like boring as hell more fun by turning it into a game with some specific principles so that would be this video right over here thank you so much for watching and I'll see you in the next video bye
