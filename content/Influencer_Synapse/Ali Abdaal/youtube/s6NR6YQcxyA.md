## Transcript
 Hey guys, welcome back to the channel. If you're new here, my name is Ali, I'm a finally in medical student at Cambridge University and in this video we're looking at the Oxbridge Medicine interview and we're going to be hearing from nine different medical students who are offering their tips. All of these students have had interviews at various colleges in Cambridge but I've shown the video to my friends at Oxford and run the tips by them and they've unanimously said that everything that applies to the Cambridge interview also applies to the Oxford interview because the two are pretty much identical in terms of, you know, what they ask you the things you need to be able to do to do well in them. If you haven't looking the description below, you'll see a link to a video containing these same medical students' experiences of the Cambridge interview and you'll also find timestamps to all 15 tips so that if you want to skip ahead or if you've seen some before or if you want to share a specific bit of the video you can just reference the appropriate timestamp. So without further ado, that's here from nine medical students talking about 15 tips for the Oxbridge Medicine interview. I really hope you find it useful and I'll see you at the end. The biggest thing I always tell everyone is that you need to be able to think out loud. It's a good song. The thinking out loud is really important. What you don't want to do when they ask you questions that you don't know the answer to is to sit there like a lemon for 30 seconds or for a minute for two minutes just kind of sitting there and thinking because the objective of the Cambridge and I assume Oxford interview isn't that you know you know the answer to everything. It's that they can see you're thinking process and they can see how you'd get the answer or how you'd reason things. So thinking out loud is super important for that. Definitely speak out loud and show them your thought process. So don't just tell them your answer, tell them why you're getting that answer and how you might sort of progress through it. If they can see your thought process that's the main thing and that's what they want to name. I was kind of practicing this before my interview that I would ask a friend to ask me a question that I didn't know the answer to and I would say things like hmm okay so what if we were to start with this concept or for example one Cambridge question that was that I found online I don't know if they actually use it was how would you calculate the number of molecules of oxygen in this room? So instead of just kind of sitting there thinking in my head how would calculate that I would kind of make it a two-way dialogue I'd be like okay molecules of oxygen so firstly we need to find the volume of the room so I mean we could eyeball that that's probably about six meters across about eight meters across maybe about three meters high so we can work out a volume from that and then I think I mean if we if we assume that we've got standard conditions we could potentially apply the gas, have a gather with gas constant I kind of hold it's called and like multiply that by the number of multiply that by the volume to get the answer so you know while it's been rambling a bit in this you can you can see that I've been thinking out loud I haven't just been kind of retreating into my head and trying to work out what the answer is so that is the number one biggest tip for the Cambridge interviews. Secondly I would say don't be afraid if you don't know the answer as I said earlier the objective is not to know the answer the objective is just to think about it and the questions they will ask you are going to be quite hard so you know if you're the type of person that gets flustered by not knowing the right answer then that's something that you want to practice something you want to work on before you interview. Always be willing to venture an answer if you don't know say well I'm not sure I don't know but if I were to hazard a guest it would be this so that you make sure that you're at least using your brain you know and thinking about the question and that's why they really want to see that you grapple with the problem intellectually. I think again remembering that they are they're to test you but also they want to get the best out of you so they in mind even when I couldn't I couldn't get to an answer for some of the more science questions they would help me if they'd give me clues and they'd really try to guide me so in that way it was good. My main thing would be revise your science is in your math be ready with days when you arrive. I used to get asked quite a lot do I need to know this level of chemistry and biology and do I need to know this stuff in chemistry and I'd say no your A level syllabus well you know no your chemistry and biology well and really know the principles but then further than that I unless you've mentioned it in your personal statement you don't need to know super you know complicated concepts because they kind of I'd say they want you to work from the principles you know at A level. Yeah if you can show evidence of why the reading it's great but what's important is not to answer the question you wish should be asked because you know loads about that answer the question they've actually asked you so they ask you about high blood pressure and coronary disease don't spout off about diabetes and coronary disease because you've read loads about that and you've read this and you did this work experience and it just answered the question it seems but if you do actually happen to know loads about the topic that they touch on they'll just move on because again like I said they're interested in seeing how much new knowledge you can take on and how you can apply your knowledge within that interview it's not sort of exactly how much you know to start with. I actually found my Cambridge interviews really fun which might make you think I'm a bit of a weirdo but actually that's really important to know because you should find it fun you should be passionate about medicine about the science he concepts that are going on because if you're applying to Oxford you're about to do a really science heavy course so if you're not passionate about it you're applying to the whole place they know that to part of whether they do the interview like that they want your passion to show fruit so if you've got problems with being really anxious for interviews or you just feel like you don't know enough science or for example you need to be able to talk confidently and enthusiastically about science on the day if because if that enthusiasm shines through the interviewer who is normally a lecturer for that subject or a tutor supervisor for that subject well think oh wow yeah this this person can think that and they're really keen like they'll be they'd be really fun to teach actually and I think that what you should be willing to do in the Cambridge interviews you should be willing to pivot and should be willing to backtrack so if you think that you're back in the country don't be proud don't have intellectual food bristle whatever just backtrack and they say oh you know that's a good point and then push the logic and the reasoning from there take you had a good one about oh yeah so I I was told when I was in six form to always take a pen and a piece of paper put and pocket somewhere because as we mentioned before a lot of the a lot of the interviews about trying to show how you get to answer what's going through your head and sometimes certain questions really help with you if you have a piece of paper just for you because you get to write things down you get to sort of think out loud while drawing things and for them it's really useful as well because they see so much some people find it hard to say out loud what they're thinking and sometimes it just just helps so much when you can draw something chilling like actually you think maybe the graph would look something like this it just shows a lot more of you and you normally would be able to say just by speaking yeah just don't be afraid to take your time with the questions right stuff down if it helps bring a hand but apart from that any interview perhaps as you can get for it will will be helpful particularly of the people have had an oxygen to be of themselves because they're really not as sinister and strange and out to get here as a medium would have you believe it's really important even if you think you've got the answer to just be slow with it yeah because being slow uses up time which is good and also it really shows you know you're thinking yeah I think that's probably a good point if you know the answer you don't want to just say oh it's this you kind of ones like because if you know the answer you already have a little bit of an answer so it takes a step back in this life you know what I'm gonna sound really clever and I'm going to work my way I'm gonna show off and like really break it down as though you're teaching them how like why that's the answer and that's really good because it's all about your thought process showing how you go through the motions and how you get there so you apply some medical school against lots of smart people right lots of people who have got straight ease you've got good grades in their exams everybody who applies to Cambridge is like the top cup of them right so if the Cambridge interview was just about getting the answers would be an extraordinarily wasteful way or finding that out after all they could just do what they do every other time and sit you in a hole and make you do a test and the people who do best in the test get in but that's a bad way of getting because you're not here to learn what you already know you're here to learn and a lot of what you learn while you're here is stuff that's like way new to you you concepts new ideas new ways of thinking he says you know frighteningly shade man so they need to test what it's like when you're learning things you don't know when you're out you're comfort zone for you learn they want to see how you learn and they only see that by finding out what you do to know so if for example they ask you a question about I don't know lungs and you happen to have done a special project on lungs and all you've done in biology up until this point was lungs and you're an expert on lungs they'll go okay fine let's talk about the kidney instead and get you right about food and that doesn't mean that you're bad it just means they recognize you know a lot about lungs and they're not going to get in a like by hearing you talk about lungs for ages they want to hear you struggle through kidneys rather than breeze through lungs because if you can demonstrate for you the way that you approach problems that you don't know the answer to as much more you sort of them and finding out that you know a lot because everybody knows a lot everybody's applying to Cambridge anyway with a lot apart from enthusiasm showing through in your interview they want to see you can think so that doesn't require you to be super duper intelligent it doesn't require you to know every last fact about some specific disease it just requires you to be able to think on your feet so when you're in there on the day make sure that you're comfortable enough to just be able to think out loud they might ask you a question on something you know nothing about but just think of any relevant information you do have and try and use that to answer the question they'll quite deliberately be asking you questions that you don't know the answer to because they don't want you to be in your comfort zone where you're going to give a textbook answer they want you to be working through they want to see how your brain works they want to see how creatively you can think how sensibly you think how you can link different ideas up I think keeping calm is a huge thing because if you freak out in the middle of that interview then you might miss out on a few stages of the question and it's really important to keep focus because for the whole interview you might be working on one question it's it's in my experience it really wasn't the why medicine why this college why this university questions it really was the sciences so I think focus on those but also be prepared because some colleges do do one that's a bit more about your personal statement about your extracurricular things so have that ready but focus on the science I'll give you this even less preparation required for a Cambridge interview than an normal interview because it's unpredictable and you know they're not going to ask you any of the questions that you think they're going to ask you so just practice talking and being relaxed and whatever relaxes you I genuinely when I came down I forgot my and in reason I needed a shave so I just walked into town got a shave at a barber and then went to the interview that was that was my exam that was my interview day preparation work well all right so that was 15 tips for the Oxford medicine interview I really hope you found it useful thank you very much for watching and a massive shout out to my friends who took part in the video and helped make it possible if you have any questions about the Oxford admissions process or about the interviews or about anything else for that matter just leave a comment down below and I'll get back to you as soon as I can equally if you have any suggestions for content that will be useful to you more things about the medicine application interviews be exam revision anything like that just let me know the comments down below and that would really help in kind of giving me ideas for videos that we could be doing on the channel so yeah let's end the video there thank you very much for watching if you like the video please give it a thumbs up if you haven't subscribed to the channel please consider doing so loads more videos coming out over the next few weeks about like interviews specifically and also more stuff about the application process and I also do vlogs every now and then about life as a medical student which you might find vaguely interesting thanks for watching have a great day and I will see you in the next one bye you
