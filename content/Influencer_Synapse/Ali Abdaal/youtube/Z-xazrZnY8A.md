## Transcript
 Hey guys, welcome back to the channel. If you're new here, my name is Ali. I'm a junior doctor working in Cambridge and in this installment of the monthly favorite series, I'm going to be talking about a book, a podcast, a blog and a physical product and all of those are going to be linked in timestamps in the video description and in the pinned comments or feel free to skip around if you feel like it. But now let's just jump into it. Alright, so before we get started, I just want to say a big thank you to everyone who commented on last month's favorite videos and I said that I would give away a copy of this book, the courage to be disliked, which we talked about in last month's video and the lucky winner is a guy called Carmen Kalson. He says hi, I'm a medical student in the University of Barcelona. Your YouTube channel has been a great help for me. Thank you. So, Kalson, Carmen, Carmen Kalson, thank you very much. You're going to get a copy of this book. I'll message you on Instagram for your address and then I'll mail this your way. Okay, let's talk about the book for this month and that is happy by Durham Brown, which is one of my favorite non-fiction books of all time. Durham Brown, I have been idealizing Durham Brown for the last like 10 years of my life. He is a famous psychological illusionist magician hypnotist. Pretty much everyone in the UK knows who he is, but I think he's now starting to make it big internationally as well. He's got a couple of Netflix specials and he's touring the US with like a Broadway show stuff like that. Anyway, this is not a book about magic although he has got some of those. This is a book about philosophy and it's called Happy, why more or less everything is absolutely fine. And it's a fantastic introduction to the stoicism school of philosophy, which has a few central tenets, but I'm just gonna read out the start of the book for you. Oh no, at the back. Everyone says they want to be happy, but that's much more easily said than done. What does being happy actually mean and how do you even know when you feel it? Across the millennia philosophers have thought long and hard about happiness, they've defined it in many different ways and come up with myriad strategies for living the good life. Drawing on this vast body of work in happy, Durham Brown explores changing concepts of happiness from the surprisingly modern wisdom of the stoics and epicurians in classical times right up until today when the self-help industry has attempted to claim happiness as its own. He shows how many of self-help suggested roots to happiness and success, such as positive thinking, self-belief and setting goals can be disastrous to follow and indeed actually cause anxiety. This brilliant, candid and deeply entertaining book exposes the flaws in these ways of thinking and in return poses challenging but stimulating questions about how we might allow ourselves to flourish and live more happily. So that's pretty much a summary of what this book is about. It's quite long, it's quite a dense read, but there is so much valuable stuff in there like this is my most highlighted book on Kindle by an absolute mile. I think second is atomic habits by James Clear which I'll talk about in another one of these videos but I first read this in 2016 when it came out and every time I read this book I gain new insights, new things about happiness and I think and now whenever anyone asks me anything like how is it that you appear so carefree and not very stressed and generally content most of the time I point them to this book which pretty much explains the philosophy that at least for me causes me to be happy, content most of the time. So I'm not really going to say much more about this. Yeah if you want to copy this this is just a physical one that I bought purely for the purposes of showing it on camera. Obviously I read books on Kindle, I don't even use physical books anymore but I'll be mailing a copy of this so please comment down below whatever you like and leave your Instagram username and again one lucky winner will receive a copy of this book with a little message from me at the front so yeah let's move on to the next one. Okay secondly let's talk about a podcast and the podcast I want to mention in this video is indiehackers. That's indiehackers.com and this is an absolutely incredible podcast for anyone who is intrigued or interested in the idea of making money on the internet and what indiehackers is is that it started off as a website that posted interviews from founders of profitable internet businesses so for example you might get someone who built an app in their bedroom and that's making a hundred thousand dollars a month basically individuals who are making cool products that they're selling on the internet usually online related things that are making them loads and loads money and it's just like sort of interviews about how they got there what their revenue figures were what tips they have for people interested in starting their own thing so I've been browsing indiehackers since pretty much at launch I think about two years ago and their podcast is particularly good and this month I listened to two episodes in particular that I really really enjoyed and the first one and I'll link them both below but the first one is an interview with with a guy called AJ he made a website called Card which is a very easy way to make one page websites kind of competing with companies like Squarespace and Wix and WordPress but also not really competing with them because he had his own little niche and through that website he's making about thirty thousand dollars a month and that's pretty solid for this thing that he just started by himself pretty much in his bedroom so that was a really interesting interview and he gets he talks about his his process and how how he got where he is but in a very self-aware way like he he he doesn't act as if he has all the answers he is fully and fully appreciates the role of luck and good timing and good fortune in his own success so he does give some really actionable advice that anyone else who's interested in starting a profitable internet business maybe making some money on the side it'll gain a lot of lessons from that and the second episode I really enjoyed was an interview with a guy called Jason Cohen who is the founder of a company called WP Engine they have about 600 employees and a hundred and thirty million dollars a year in recurring revenue and they're the company that are used to host my six-med website six-med is my side business and this was really interesting because this was completely opposite to the AJ interview this guy, Jason, runs a company of 600 people with a hundred and thirty million dollars a year of revenue and what Jason talks about in this interview is that how he's been doing this entrepreneurship thing for the last 20 years and he's done several businesses where it was just him just him and his mates no investment nothing like that just building a product from the ground up and making it profitable but now he wanted to do the whole company thing and he shares some of the lessons he's learned from growing a company to 600 people and also about the roles of things like sales and marketing and human resources and finance and all those sort of corporate BS sort of things that like I've never really appreciated because I've never really come into contact with them and I've always thought that obviously you know when when making an app it's it's the product that's the most important part but actually Jason talks about how it's all these other things that play a part as well and how the way that he runs this company is now based on frameworks and models and this and that and it was just a totally different realm of experience to what I've been running my own company for the last six years and that's very much been me and my mates running a very small scale operation but it was a very very interesting hearing his views and what a running a massive operation is like so if you have any interest at all in entrepreneurship and maybe if you know if the idea of setting up a business on the internet to make money on the side seems intriguing at all you should definitely check out indiehackers.com if you haven't already so that is the second of this month's monthly favorites. Thirdly I want to talk about a blog post that I came across on the website of a guy called Seth Gordon and if you haven't heard of him Seth Gordon is a very famous amongst entrepreneurs sort of guy and for the last 30 years he's been teaching about entrepreneurship and marketing and writing and how to set up your own businesses and he's written like 19 best selling books about this but he has a blog and instead of it being a weekly blog it's actually a daily blog so like every single day he writes a blog post and he's been doing that for the last I think for over a decade now and that firstly is absolutely incredible that you can just write a blog post every day I struggle to write a blog post an email newsletter every week and he does it every day so that's really cool but there was one that particularly resonated with me that I actually mentioned in my own weekly email newsletter and it's called the gap between half two and get two and he says deadlines work they work because they focus the mind and create urgency they work to get us to file our taxes or finish an assignment they're an external lever for the work we have to do on the other hand dessert works too you don't need an external force to encourage you to eat dessert after you finish your vegetables it's something you get to do not something you have to do you can build a work life around deadlines you can procrastinate pay the late finds and push through the last minute emergencies because you need all of that and it to get to have to mode or you can follow the path of the most productive and happy people you know by redefining the work you've chosen to do as something you get to do and yes I'll point out that you can even do that with your taxes it's something you get to do because you're successful and lucky enough to live in a civil society so the blog posts are all around kind of this length if you a few paragraphs some of them are just a few lines some of them are a bit longer but this really resonates with me this this gap between half two and get to and how such a simple shift in language and how we describe something completely changes the game in terms of how we feel about the stuff we have to do so we actually talked about this in one of the episodes of mine and my brothers podcast I'll link that one as well where we talk about this for like 40 minutes at length and we're kind of doing it in the context of do we enjoy our jobs and how do we how do we how do we make ourselves enjoy our jobs more and I think a big part of it is this difference between thinking we have to do something and thinking instead that we get to do something so for example I'm a doctor or my doctor friends we all love to complain to each other about how we have to do all these discharge paperwork how we have to I don't know go and review and unwell patient big but it's a middle of the night and we've got ten other things to be doing also if you're in school you're probably complain to friends about how or I have to do that essay I have to get that homework done I have to revise some exams and we treat all these things things for the most part that we've chosen to do and that we recognize the value of we treat them as like oh I have to do this and if therefore it makes it a burden we treat it like a burden whereas if we just try and shift the language to I get to do this so now like like when I'm at work and I'm doing a discharge letter like for the last weeks since I discovered the blog post instead of thinking that I have to do this discharge letter I think I get to do this discharge letter and sometimes that just that small change just reminding myself to do it like that sort of transforms the experience it like it genuinely a paradigm shift sometimes it doesn't work sometimes I'm still like oh yeah I still have to do this I've still got ten other things I should be doing but more often than not I think you know what this is fine I I can appreciate the value in this discharge letter I know that this is the information that's going to go to the GP I know that the patient is going to see this information I know it's going to be a summary of what their 30-day hospital admission is look like I like I'm privileged to be able to write this for them having that sense of integrated food and the fact that I get to write this discharge letter rather than that I have to write this discharge letter completely changes the game and makes me happier at work so I think a that particular blog post is really really useful so I linked that below if you want to have a read of it and try and maybe remind yourself of that but in general I think Seth Gooden's blog is a really fantastic one to follow it's one of the very few email news letters that I subscribe to and every single day I get the email and every single day I read it because it's generally really valuable advice so that is number three on this month list Last thing this month I want to talk about a physical product and that physical product is a guitar and a guitar is something that I think everyone should get because it's absolutely changed my life since I bought one of these I bought my first guitar in my second year of university so it was in about February 2015 I've never played the guitar before I was always kind of into singing and I thought it would be cool to learn how to play the guitar but then at the Pakistan society ball one of my friends from UCL University in London he he was a medical student as well and he got up on stage and played an absolutely amazing rendition of tears and heaven and I just absolutely fell in love with that and I was like oh man I would love to be able to do what that guy did so I went to a charity shop I bought a guitar for about 30 pounds and over the course of that of those next few months I told myself how to play the guitar using just in guitar.com that's like a free online video course and he takes you through all the various things that you need to know in order how to play the guitar and it was only about 10 15 20 minutes of practice a day and after about a month I was at a standard where I could like accompany myself while singing along and then a few months later I actually accompanied some friends of mine on stage to a crowd of about a thousand people at this other sort of Hindu society event and that was from never playing the guitar before never really having any music lessons except you know one year of violin lessons that I had when at the age of 11 and apart from that I didn't really have any musical background but I was able to pick up the guitar and follow along with just in guitar.com's amazing video course and now I can play the guitar so now like when friends come over who enjoy singing we just kind of shout the guitar do a little bit of jamming here and there and I post videos on my Instagram story of myself playing and I've even done busking in in Cambridge Town Centre a few times with friends we've raised some money for the local homeless shelter and essentially this guitar has added a ton of joy to my life and it all started because I decided you know what I'm gonna learn the guitar and it's not that hard to learn the guitar it just takes about 15 minutes a day of practice for about a month if you just follow along with just in guitar.com you end up becoming pretty reasonable at the guitar and something I want to improve a bit more but if you've ever thought that you know if you like if you enjoy singing and you want to be able to accompany yourself or you know even if you don't then you're very good at singing like you're probably a lot better than you think you are if you can hold a tune and it just changes the game when you can just bust out a guitar you can accompany yourself you can play songs with your friends so that's it for this video I'm gonna end with a little bit of a song I wasn't planning to do this but while we're here we might as well let me be right here would you dance if I asked you to dance would you run and never look back would you cry if you saw me crying would you save my soul tonight I can be your hero baby but I can't kiss away the pain but I will stand by you forever you can't take my breath away so yeah that was just a bit of fun I've been playing that one in the house recently just randomly that was one of the first few things I learned on the guitar because this like that sequence just like sounded really impressive to me initially and then when I realized how easy it is to play that it just blew my mind but you know if you've never played the guitar before you can get to that level of playing guitar within like easily within a month of 10 minutes of practice every day it's really not hard at all I'm not amazing at the guitar but I can play chords I kind of company myself and it's it's good enough to be able to play on stage obviously you know it's all it's all a work in progress but yeah guitar is a great thing to have and adds a lot of joy to your life and the life of people around you and it's just nice so yeah that's it for this month's video thank you for watching if you liked the video please give it a thumbs up if you haven't subscribed to the channel then please consider doing so have a lovely day and I'll see you in the next video goodbye
