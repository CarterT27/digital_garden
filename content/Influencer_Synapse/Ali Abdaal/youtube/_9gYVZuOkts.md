## Transcript
 Hey guys, welcome back to the channel. If you're new here, my name is Ali. I'm a junior doctor working in Cambridge. And today is a very exciting day. Because this bad boy has just arrived. It's the boosted board mini. Let's get it unboxed and let's take it for a spin. And see what it's like to ride an electric skateboard for the first time ever. I cannot wait. Oh, this is really heavy. It's a lot heavier than I expected. It's quite a nice size. Oh, box over here. You've got the controller cable. How a brick. This is really nice packaging. This feels almost like opening an Apple product. And some boosted stickers, of course. Absolutely classic. All right. So. So here's the board. Here's the controller. And theory. All you do is press. Oh wow. This is really heavy. Press the on button for two seconds. Okay. I've pressed the power button. I'm hoping something. Oh, hello. The connecting light is flashing. It's all. It's all going mental. Whoa. It works. Oh. All right. Here goes nothing. All right. That's pretty cool as well. I think now we're going to take it outside. And yeah. Let's see. Let's see how that goes. All right. Here we go. Camera on one hand. Controller on the other hand. What could go wrong? This is sick. Oh my goodness. This is one of the most interesting experiences of my life. All right. Speed up a bit. Oh my god. I can totally imagine using this as a form of transportation. Breaking on this thing is really, really powerful. This throttle is super sensitive. So if I kind of. Whoa. If I like it on the brakes like that, it just completely stops the board. And I almost have to kind of jump off slash fall off. It turned out I was actually riding on Eco mode this entire time. I've not switched to begin a mode and it feels much more pleasant. I've very quite liked this begin a mode. So let's go max speed. So I'm going max speed on begin a mode now. This is apparently 11 miles per hour. It feels quite fast. Okay. Switch to Eco mode. You have definitely a lot faster. This one goes up 16 miles per hour apparently. Okay. And finally, let's do a lapar on the neighborhood and expert mode. Which now on locks. It's maximum speed of 20 miles per hour. Oh my god. 20 miles per hour. Okay. No. I'm not going to go 20 miles per hour while vlogging. This is not quite. What a first look should be like. But yeah. Very responsive very fast.
