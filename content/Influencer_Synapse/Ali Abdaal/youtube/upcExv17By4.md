## Transcript
 Hey guys, welcome back to the vlog. Today is a day three of our GP placement. So I'm going to be vlogging the day to show you what kind of happens on a standard day of GP. So first, we've got to get out of this outfit and change just something a little bit more appropriate. Let's go. Right, and we're also cutting it quite fine because we've got our first clinic in about 15 minutes and I overstep to bit and also have to plan on that little magic trick that you just saw. So, uh, go to run. We'll see you back in the practice. Alright, so here we are in the practice and we've just spent the last hour and a bit seeing our impatience. Normally each day, we run two separate clinics. One in the morning, one in the afternoon, where we see about two, three or four patients and we do all the talking. We write up all the notes and then at the end of it, we send a message to the doctor using the electronic system and they come in just to make sure everything's all good and to prescribe whatever drugs and you're prescribing. It's a pretty good fun, quite a good learning experience. Today, I saw someone with arthritis who we did a full range of blood tests on just to make sure that it was indeed where entire changes rather than some kind of inflammatory conditions that could be causing problems. There was a patient with what we thought was psoriasis on the scalp, so we prescribed some anti psoriasis steroids gel for that. There was a patient who had fainted randomly and had like really random episodes of fainting over the past few years. So, we booked them in for a 24 hour ECG heart monitoring just to make sure there isn't any kind of weird cardiac rhythm going on that could be causing the fainting. So, it's been a pretty good morning so far. Not really sure what's happening for the rest of the day. I think we might be going on some home visits and then we'll have our own clinic again in the afternoon and I think we're planning a trip to the beach. So, see you very shortly. So, we've had our patients in the morning and out of the beach because it's finally a lovely sunny day. I'm getting an ice cream and very excited. I think we're going to have a nice day. I think we're going to have a nice day. It's not the home. It's not the beach. Okay, so quite a good afternoon. Just so three patients. One of them had a condition called polymyology rheumatica, which gives you lots and lots of stiffness kind of in the shoulders, the neck and the hips. So, we gave him some steroids and steroids are a really like almost magical pill for PMR polymyology rheumatica because within like a day or two of taking steroids, it's something if you're much better. It can move around that life changing treatment apparently. Then we had a patient who had chest infection, so we sent for a chest X-ray and gives him antibiotics too. So, that's us done for the day then. It is now three o'clock. We're going to head home decide what to cook this evening, might go to the pub and yeah, just do lots of self-directed learning. So, yeah, we'll see you at home and we'll do a tour of our little cottage, which is quite a nice location to spend six weeks in. See you in a bit. Here we have the front door. This is a side door. The door opens onto the street. That is the butchers over there. The GP practice is about 30 seconds in of that way direction. So, this area is our little porch thing and then we walk in and this is the house. This is Rachel. How are you feeling Rachel? I'm great. So, we have a sofa over here. Oh, this is one of the lazy boy things. Look at that. Oh my god. It like extends. So, this is all the living room. We've got a TV over there. Rachel's over there tables over here. Got a nice little welcome sign of out there, which is quite cool. Radiator, kitchen, stove, oven, grill, microwave, kettle, bathroom number one, shower, bathroom, blah, blah, blah, whatever, cereal box, fridge, DVDs, lamp, spices, picture frame, picture frame, weird althing, staircase. This is my room. I went for the smaller one because I'm such a gentleman from a bed lamp book, window, radiator, jeans, wardrobe, church, dirty clothes and scrubs that are used as my pajamas. Now, let's have a look inside Rachel's room. Oh, look at this. There's a big book, double bed, window mirror, me pointing at the camera. I frame picture another picture. And finally, we have the bathroom, saying toilet shower. Okay, so it's seven o'clock. We spent the last few hours doing a mixture of nothing preparing for the PSA, the prescribing safety examination, and I was doing some video editing, photo editing, editing some of the drone shots for Instagram, all that stuff. Now, we're going to head down to the pub for dinner because we can't be bothered to cook tonight. So, yeah, we'll see you there. All right, so we've come back from the pub. Dinner at the pub was amazing. It was a lot of food, so we've got a lot left over for a midnight snack for tonight. Now it's like 9pm. We're going to spend a little bit of time doing some work, doing some video editing, and maybe playing some guitar, and yeah, that will do for today. It's been a pretty wonderful day. Thank you very much for watching. If you like the video, please give it a thumbs up. If you haven't subscribed yet, please consider doing so. Have a lovely night. I'll see you in the next video. Goodbye.
