## Transcript
 Hey friends, welcome back to the vlog where you can join me on our shared journey of trying to be productive during quarantine. The day starts at 9 a.m. when I wake up and do my usual thing of showering and changing into somewhat fresh clothing and decide that the first order of business is to tidy the house a little because it's a mess from yesterday's filming session. Wash up my various mugs and generally become less of a slob, somehow this ends up taking a solid hour, interrupted of course by procrastination on my phone and then at 10 a.m. I have a catch-up call with my friend Zhishan, a pediatrician who works in London and is the founder of the unofficial Guide to Medicine series of books that I used to use as a medical student, which had about our long-term plans, the pros and cons of a long-term career in medicine, active versus passive income and a load of other stuff that gets me inspired in keen to pump out that productivity. At 11.15 I relocated the sofa and get started with work which today involves preparing a teaching session that I'll be delivering over Zoom in the afternoon around Castro intestinal physiology isn't that just so much fun. I start by scoping the subject by splitting it into three parts, firstly general gut physiology, secondly the upper gastrointestinal system and thirdly the lower gastrointestinal system. I'm making my revision presentation on Keynote which is the Mac equivalent of PowerPoint for all your heathens out there and I'm putting in material from three different sources. Firstly the lecture slides, secondly the first aid USMLE step one book that I'm going through in the app, PDF expert and thirdly the various notes and questions I've made in Notion who are incidentally kindly sponsoring this video. If you haven't heard Notion is one of my favorite apps of all time and I use it for tons of different things including my medicine notes, planning videos, writing blog posts, tracking workouts, keeping track of all the stuff that I read, watch and listen to and taking notes on any date that I go on. In the past you had to pay for a Notion account and it was still totally worth it, but as of May 2020 Notion is now completely free of charge for personal use. So if you haven't got an account do hit the link in the video description to sign up for the personal account which is free forever with no limits in the blog that you can add to it isn't that fantastic. Anyway as you can see here I've got the structure of the first topic mapped out in Notion and in my previous study session I dropped various notes and diagrams into the toggle blocks so that I could hide the information under questions for myself. So I'm now using those notes that I made for myself to build a teaching session for my students which saves me a lot of time. I continue in this vein for the next 45 minutes, continuing to build up the revision presentation with these different sources and then by half past 12 I find myself losing concentration. So I lie on the sofa for a few minutes doing absolutely nothing and then decide to stop being a waste man and do some quick exercises to get my heart rate up and to bring me one step closer to my dream of becoming a gym shark athlete. Once my arms are feeling sufficiently swollen I head over to the bedroom for a change of scenery. I change into my David Dobrik Murch hoodie that's become my favorite hoodie of all time and I crawl into bed with my trusty MacBook Pro. I spend a few minutes replying to YouTube comments because I'm such a nice guy and then get back to work. In the next 45 minutes I finished the revision presentation and so from 115 to 2pm I added a script of an episode of book club featuring atomic habits by James Clear. Again, as usual I'm using notion which is what my team and I used to plan all of our videos and business related things so here I am going through our existing script and trying to add some more personal examples and casual elements to make it seem hopefully less scripted than it actually was, fingers crossed. From 2pm to 4pm my students and I run through a gastrointestinal physiology revision session and then at the end we blitz through some past paper questions to apply active recall to what we've just learned. I really like this teaching thing because rather than feeling drained by the end of it I usually feel pretty energized so I use this hype energy to my advantage and at 4pm I sit down to do some guitar practice. I'm practicing one of the major scales but trying to do it with minimal finger movement as my guru, just in guitar, advises and then I do a few drills to increase my finger strength that I don't know why this sounds so weird. Afterwards I knock out a cheeky cover of Hey There Delilah on the ukulele for my Instagram to make sure you're following me on there if you care to see photos of me at work, behind the scenes stories from my life and various videos of my questionable singing. Once I've done my music session for the day my discipline runs out and I lie on the sofa vegetating on my phone. I consider filming a new video briefly but then my grandma calls me from Pakistan and tells me off for posting so many YouTube videos and implores me to focus on medicine instead. With the chat I decide to give myself just 5 more minutes of doing absolutely nothing, which inevitably turns into more than an hour of doing absolutely nothing, I take a brief break to empty the bins because the house is dying smell and then at 7pm I get back on the sofa. This time switching gears to my iPad Pro and continue working through the script for the atomic habits video. I'm using notion and Kindle in split screen to get quotes from relevant areas of the book and by half past 7 the script is finally finished and ready to film. So I decide to take a break and cook for myself. Yes, that's right friends. If I want to become a gym shock athlete, I need to up my healthy eating game. This is a pesto coated oven baked cod with turmeric rice and salsa with fresh groceries delivered from mindful chef. A grocery delivery thing that I've been trying out recently. I follow the instructions to the tea and then by half past 8 foods ready and I decide to throw productivity to the winds and watch an episode of Money Heist on Netflix. I'm actually still pretty hungry after this home cooked meal because obviously they never give you big enough portion sizes. Although I order an additional takeaway for the evening and proceed to watch another 7 episodes of Money Heist, there goes the dream of becoming a gym shock athlete. It's been a pretty long time to be honest since I've done a TV show binge like this and I'm not gonna lie, I've kind of missed it. I've finally managed to tear myself away from it at half past 2 in the morning, having told myself just one more episode like 4 times in a row. It then takes me another hour to actually get to bed because I have to upload the files from this vlog to Google Drive and of course waste another 30 minutes of my life watching a Logan Paul vlogs on YouTube what is life. With this point it's 320am and I'm pretty knackered thankfully I'm on twilight shift at work this week which started 4pm and finished midnight so I can have a nice lie into more morning and so ends this study with me day in the life and lockdown thank you so much for watching stay safe and I'll see you in the next one. Good night.
