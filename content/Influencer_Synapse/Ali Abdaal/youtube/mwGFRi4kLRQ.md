## Transcript
 Hey guys, welcome back to the channel. If you're new here on my name is Ali, I'm a finally medical student at Cambridge University and in this video we're going to be talking about tips for the MMI, the multiple mini interviews which is the interview format for the majority of the medical schools in the UK use these days. Now this is quite a short video and that's because we've already got a video with 13 tips on how to prepare for interviews and as you'll see, the very first point is that interviews and MMIs like there's so much overlap between them that any tips that apply to interviews also apply to MMIs. Anyway in this video we'll be hearing from a few different medical students about you know advice they've got for you MMI preparation, things you can do on the day. I hope you find it useful. I'm just going to roll through the tips and then I'll see you at the end for the classic like comment subscribe thing. See you shortly. One thing that I would say is that people often think that interview preparation and MMI preparation are separate entities when they're really not like we often get people who who would say that oh I'm looking for an MMI course not an interview course and that just doesn't make sense to me because the skills you need to do well in an interview are exactly the same as the skills you need to do well in an MMI. MMI just gives you that interview in bite size chunks maybe about eight minutes long. So don't get into so if you do have if you're applying to universities that exclusively use MMI don't fall into the trap of ignoring interview advice in favor of MMI advice because it basically the same thing and there are loads of decent resources out there aimed at preparing you for the interviews which you can also use to prepare for MMI. This is a time in time and it's really important for a MMI so I think definitely practice giving your answers under a time pressure so maybe like five to eight minutes it varies depending on where you're interviewing at. The good thing about an MMI interviews that you have a clean say each time but obviously it doesn't always quite work like that if you mess something up in the one station you might feel really mortified and it might kind of crash your appointments on the next one if you're not careful. So if you're the kind of person to get stressed out and take it to heart just try and work out ways to calm yourself down. For me when I get worried like the simplest things are the best so I just take a few seconds take a few deep breaths and move on and that really you need to be able to think on your feet because they're not they're not going to go in an ask you I don't know when was the NHS like invented but they could ask you something around like a hot topic like a current debate topic so you need to be able to have these ideas in your head and be able to form it in argument for them without being rehearsed which goes back to what I was kind of like what I've always said where it's like prepare your answers and try and come across just go by talking point to the point it's supposed to be script. My main thing with M&I would be to try again speaking out loud talking to people about anything about any subject try tackling ethics questions with your friends try explaining weird abstract concepts to each other so things like how to tie your shoe without without using any hand gestures showing someone how to tie their shoe different funny things like that that get you used to that five minute scenario I guess also anything a bit medical as well so just think about random questions of what would you do if you found someone who need a medical attention and things like that I really useful just to get your brain in training for doing five minute quick scenarios and they're not expecting you to be perfect otherwise there'll be no point applying to do the medical course but they're just wanting to see someone who copes under pressure and who can try their hand lots of different things and do generally well across the board. Oh and relax just relax and don't focus on how you do an other station just always think about the station at your room. All right thank you very much for watching those were six tips for the M&I's the multiple mini interviews I really hope you found them useful and in addition to the 13 or 14 tips we've got from the interview video that gives you about 20 tips for interview preparation and M&I's and all that so yeah if you like the video please give a thumbs up if you haven't subscribed to the channel please consider doing so you've got loads more videos coming as always about interviews and other things related to the medicine application and I also do vlogs every now and then about life as a medical student so you might like to watch this but yeah thanks for watching have a lovely day and we'll see you next time bye
