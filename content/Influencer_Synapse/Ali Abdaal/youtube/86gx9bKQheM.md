I had the pleasure of attending the Cambridge clinical school's faculty meeting, where I gave a presentation about this YouTube channel and some thoughts about how the clinical school might use platforms like YouTube to improve the student experience. It was a great day out in a lovely venue, discovering what happens behind the scenes of our curriculum. Enjoy xx

## Transcript
 Okay guys, welcome back to the vlog. I seem to be here at the clinical school a wayday, which is basically like a big faculty meeting, and they've invited me along to give a presentation about my YouTube channel. So this is really exciting, this venue is amazing, I've never been here before. So yeah, welcome to the vlog of what goes on behind the scenes of the Cambridge University Medical School. Alright, so we've just had the morning session, but at last you're really fun. We heard from the dean that we had a few talks from people making very sorts of like e-learning content. There were talks about these online resources that they're kind of trialing into brings students online examiner training. So it seems like this whole electronic learning thing is it's really being pushed. So now it's a coffee break. Now we're going to have a few more talks. I think one of them is going to be about assessment, which I'm quite interested in, just because I like absolutely love exams. And then after lunch, we're going to have the student presentations in which I'm going to be giving my talk where I talk about my YouTube channel. So yeah, so we've just had a few presentations about the UK, the Malay, the UK medical licensing assessment. I'm videoing. Well, sort of just kind of making up my life real. It's that's all right. Now we're all breaking up into different groups and we're going to try and write a multiple choice question. See how hard it is. Before we call baby, we're going to get stressed. What sort of ups would you expect in a sick baby dispossbotippingË∫´. Watch more information. Oh Dr Fordlympic no more do you mind just nodding the camera another pro? Thank you very much So we heard from Kevin talking about improving the quality of lives of patients while Recurrentsistitis. We've heard from Andrew talking about mapping the human brain. I want to bring things back down to kind of like more my level talking about YouTube I've been making videos on YouTube for the last nine months and in that time I've made about a hundred and ten videos We have a lot of free time as many of the students as I did me and And then I got an email from Dr Davies last week asking if I'd like to talk about the YouTube channel and give some ideas as to how the clinical school might use A platform like YouTube to improve the student experience So naturally I jumped to the idea of a free lunch. Thank you very much for the advice and yeah, I'm going to talk about YouTube Conclusion hopefully I have managed to sell the idea that the clinical school could make our own YouTube channel with high quality educational videos to medical students If this works out we would be hailed as the world leader in medical education and most importantly people will apply to us instead of also So thank you very much Just want to reiterate about how extraordinary art students are when I was your stage I was barely literate when I had You've reached this time in the afternoon the spiral quick You All right, so that's the end of the clinical school away day for the final two hours We had a session as I grew up session where we all split into various different tables That was really quite interesting. We were learning about kind of education theory and about kind of hypothetical deductive reasoning versus pattern recognition I found it interesting because a when you're my age or or younger you have this idea that that you know the the adults I like a different sort of a different league, but actually you know it was it was a dude talking through a PowerPoint It was quite engaging the PowerPoint is quite good Then we were breaking up into group work and doing like spider diagrams and post it notes and all the kind of stuff that we dissociate with like School or university I didn't realize that that's a kind of stuff that real adults actually do when like planning out a curriculum or when they kind of training themselves had a teach students So that was really interesting and secondly Just kind of appreciating the amount of work that goes on behind the scenes of the clinical school. It's been a really fantastic day My presentation seemed to have gone down reasonably well Got approached by a few people good few emails. It's been quite a nice late networking opportunity. I think we're going to end by sending the drone up and see if we can get some shots It's nice to see how the faculty thinks and decides things and what they're getting It's very interesting to expect it. I helped quite a lot for us to see you in this video All right, so that's brought us to the end of this clinical school faculty. Oh, a day. Thank you very much for watching If you liked the video please give it a thumbs up if you haven't subscribed please consider doing so have a lovely day and we'll see you next time.
