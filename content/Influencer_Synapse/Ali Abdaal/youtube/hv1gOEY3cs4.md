## Transcript
 Hey guys, welcome back to the channel. If you're new here, my name is Ali, I'm a junior doctor working in Cambridge and in this video I want to share three books that have really changed my life over the last few years and I'll be sharing some of the lessons that I got from each of these along with some quotes. Before we get started, I just want to say a big thank you to Blinkist for sponsoring this video. There are fantastic app that lets you read summaries of popular nonfiction books so you can learn lessons from them and at the end of the video I'll talk about the value that I derived from Blinkist and how it fits into my life as a doctor slash youtuber. But yeah, let's just get started by talking about book number one. This is the four hour work week by Tim Ferris, subtitle escape the 95, live anywhere and join the new rich. And then to leave this book is the author talking about his story but also giving some tips about how you can, if you want to, you can quit your job and set up businesses with automated streams of income and essentially creating a system where by your businesses are generating you money without you having to physically do work for that. And then you're able to travel the world and live this sort of lifestyle that everyone thinks is just the exclusive domain of rich people. Like for example, when I was growing up, I just had in my head this vague notion that I would be called to be rich. And if I were to really examine that, I would have thought, oh well, I guess because if you're rich then you can travel and stuff and then you don't have to work and stuff. And the idea that he talks about here is that actually a lot of this whole life of a rich person. I, you know, just the idea of being able to travel and live on a beach in Thailand all this sort of stuff is available surprisingly cheaply. Like for just a few thousand dollars per month, you can live like a really, really, really rich person in places like Thailand and like Argentina and other cool places like that. Rather than, you know, do this whole thing that we all get trained to do, i.e. work really hard, go to a good university, get a fantastic job, work super super super hard and then make loads of money so that when you retire then you can be happy. Rather than doing that instead it's more about, you know, why are we working to retire when we're in our 60s and we've got osteoarthritis in both our knees. Instead, why don't we take those 20 years of retirement and spread them out throughout our life so he suggests that we will try this thing of many retirements where each year you take a few months off and you go traveling while running your business remotely from your laptop or whatever. Which sounds all scammy and stuff but if you have even a passing interest in entrepreneurship or studying your own business or if the idea of being able to travel the world while your business is generate money while you sleep, if that seems even remotely intriguing to you then you should definitely read this book to be honest you're probably ready already but the impact it's really had on me is that this has been the book that has pretty much single handedly allowed me to set up my business so I set up a company while i was in medical school six years ago. 2013 I was yeah six years ago now and we run courses for medical school applicants then made like an online question bank and some online courses and all this stuff and that company's been doing really well it's done six figures in revenue pretty much every year since it started with five figure corporation tax bills. Thank you, her Majesty's revenue and customs and I was able to run that company alongside studying medicine at Cambridge and doing reasonably well in my exams because of the stuff that I learned in this book so all the productivity tricks and tricks things like outsourcing to remote workers that was a big reason as to why some of our question banks were really successful. A big reason as to why my own mental health wasn't completely destroyed by you know the challenge of running a company alongside being a medical student so this was all the stuff that I learned from this book. I'll stop whaffling on about it but yeah any interest at all in entrepreneurship or anything like that definitely give this a read and check out his podcast the Tim Ferriss show is absolutely wonderful so yeah let's move on to book number two. All right this is a tiny book called Show Your Work by Austin Cleon and this has been another book that has been really pivotal to my life it's really small it took me about half an hour to read it on Kindle and actually I only bought these physical copies so that I could show them off in this video but yeah I'm gonna have this around the house now and gonna be revisiting the lessons in it whenever I pick it up anyway um this has been a really pivotal book in my life because for a long time like ever since I started medical school and started running this company six med I'd been sort of toying with the idea of setting up a personal blog and kind of writing about some of the lessons that I gained and you know book reviews and things like that and I'd never been able to get over the fear of personal like self-promotion that you know it's people people are going to judge me people are going to think how I'm an arrogant narcissistic twat for having the audacity to have a blog you know with my domain like Aliabdahl.com I mean who's got their own name as a domain name and as you're like super rich and super famous blah blah blah I used to have all these negative thoughts about this whole stuff and then in January 2016 I read show your work by Austin Cleon and that completely changed the game for me it may be realized that actually um even if you're not an expert in anything just the fact that you have done anything at all means that you can then write about that experience and there will be people somewhere in the world who will find that helpful so for example setting up a company in med school like you know it's it's not a very common thing and it's a sort of thing a lot of people would be interested in there for if I just write about it and I can share the lessons that I've learned and just kind of help people and that's the main idea that this book says is that by sharing your work with the world you are working towards helping people and that is going to be an inherent good so after reading this I started my own blog I started writing a few posts that year and I think if it hadn't been for this book I wouldn't have even set up this YouTube channel because starting that blog was the small step that made me comfortable with the idea of putting myself out there and you know I've had so many messages from people asking advice for starting a YouTube channel and oh how do you get over the fear and there really isn't way to get over the fear but I think you know taking small steps reading this book let's you see that actually there isn't really much to be afraid of and sharing yourself and your work with the world is only really going to be a good thing of the message that you're sharing is positive so yeah I've now had in the realm of like over over 2,000 messages and comments from people all around the world who've been inspired or have been you know have learnt something from the content that I've put out from the work that I've shared I've shown and I think if it weren't for this book that I read three years ago none of this would have happened so thank you Austin Cleon for encouraging me to become more okay with the idea of putting myself out there if this is something that you ever thought about if you have something to say if you think you might have something to say if you like the idea of maybe writing stuff and sharing it with the world even if you don't if you're any kind if you make any kind of content at all if you're any if you're an artist if you're a painter if you're a writer anything like that you'll just really really benefit from reading this book because it's it takes like half an hour to read this no time at all you can buy on Amazon or stick a link in the description below and you'll love it'll change your life like it did mine I hope and last but obviously not least is anything you want this again really tiny book by Derek Sivers that takes like half an hour to read as well 40 lessons for a new kind of entrepreneur and yeah it's got the word entrepreneur in the title but even if you're not an entrepreneur I think you can still gain a lot from this book pretty much anyone everyone should read this book because it's a lot of lessons for life not just for entrepreneurship anyway this had an enormous impact on me as well and can honestly say that this really changed my life Derek Sivers is a guy he set up a company called CD Baby many years ago grew it to like an 80 man operation with millions and millions and revenue then sold it for like 20 million dollars and you know gave that money to like this charitable trust from musical education talk like that anyway in this book he talks about his story of how he got started with the company but also a very counter-intuitive approach to business and also to life i.e. not chasing growth all the time and actually just trying to make something that you enjoy running and you enjoy the process often that you're having fun and that you're helping people that's such a novel thing in the world you know where every startup is just aiming to get that billion dollar valuation aiming for growth at all costs but this was like a very nice very nice thing and for me this is a bug that I'll always hold really dear because when I was in my fourth year approaching the end of my fourth year of medical school I'd been running my company six med for that for like three years at that point and we'd been growing in terms of revenue every year in terms of student numbers it was taking up more and more of my time but then around 2016 on growth started to stagnate and I'd never really experienced anything like that before where you know you've grown something and it keeps on growing and suddenly it stops and then you're like oh wow it's on the decline and this made me really really sad during some of the days of my fourth year and I could remember kind of lying in bed awake thinking you know whatever what have I done where I've gone wrong have I screwed up my life by throwing away this fantastic opportunity I had and then I came across this book there's one quote in particular that I want to share from here and it's on this chapter yeah okay so in this chapter he's talking about how sometimes NBA types you know people with NBA's monsters and bits of administrations would ask me what's your growth rate what's your retained earnings rate as a percentage of growth what are your projections for your company he's talking about his own company I'd just say I have no idea I don't even know what some of that means I started this as a hobby to help my friends and that's the only reason it exists there's money in the bank and I'm doing fine so no worries and then he goes on to say and this is probably my favorite quote of all time and I what a quote that I return to many times a month whenever I'm feeling down or whenever I'm feeling like explaining it here's the quote never forget why you're really doing what you're doing are you helping people are they happy are you happy are you profitable isn't that enough question mark and this is just like if there are if there are three lines like you know anytime I read this it just makes me feel infinitely better because like doing stuff like running a business where you're aiming for growth in revenues and profits and stuff and also now this thing of having a YouTube channel having this like social media following having an email list and everything that I'm now doing in my life with the exception of my you know full-time job of being a doctor all these other things are all geared towards making stuff and then trying to grow the brand or you subscribe account or the revenue or whatever and that can be quite I don't want to say stress what I don't like the word stress well it can be quite it's it's it's something that that often plays on my mind and I know from speaking to other people doing this sort of stuff that it plays on their minds as well and the idea being that whenever you're relaxing or spending time with friends or family and stuff you just sort of in the back of your mind you're thinking you know I could be making a video right now and if I you know if I don't show now that that video this week then you know the algorithms not gonna rank my channel highly enough or you know I could be writing a blog post for six men about how to get to me because medical school right now and then that will rank as highly for search and an optimization then more people are gonna find of course and then we'll get more revenue and you're just kind of go down this spiral where anytime you're not working you feel super super super guilty for it and you can't really enjoy life because you have this amazing thing that you've somehow you know by the grace of God you've got this YouTube channel or this company and you know you have to keep putting work into them to make them grow but you also want to live a life on the side and just this this quote it's just it's just amazing like never forget why are you really doing what you're doing are you helping people are they happy are you happy are you profitable isn't that enough so whenever I find myself thinking oh you know I should make another video so I couldn't you something about ad revenue is or oh my ad revenues have dropped this month because I haven't made an iPad video know while or any anything like that I just you know open this book on my Kindle find my highlighted quote and just read that because I just make me appreciate that you know the revenue is an important you know I'm enjoying what I'm doing which is fantastic I've got this amazing thing going on the side and in addition to my full time job which I also quite enjoy it's making a reasonable amount it's making an incredible amount of money actually and it's not an amount of money that I'd ever dreamed I could have been making especially at this age and therefore you know it's it's helping people I get messages from people who are happy because I've inspired them or you know help them learn something I've helped them out with their exams or getting to medical and I'm happy doing it I think people are happy watching these videos I hope people are happy watching these videos and that's that's enough that that's all we really need and a lot of burnout within entrepreneurship within YouTube or within bloggers or then anything like this comes from people working too hard to grow the numbers to grow the audience to grow everything and I think if anyone is stuck in that position really if you're not this is just like a really good bookfall to general life advice yeah anything you want a direct service one of my favorite books had a big impact on my life because it's helped me become more happy and at peace with this whole kind of running an online entrepreneurship empire think empire is stronger I don't mean empire just like you know being an online online person who tries to make money online and stuff just really really really good book okay this all video has been a lot more awfully than I intended but I hope you guys enjoyed it if you did can you let let me know in the comments or if you didn't again I'd love to hear some constructive advice as to what you do differently if you know I do want to do more book reviews and stuff and I've read a lot of books over the thanks to having a Kindle and thanks to Blinkist which I'll talk more about in a second I've read so many books over the years and I do want to talk more about books on this channel and yeah so any kind of feedback about the about the format would be great and before we finish I just want to tell you about Blinkist which is a fantastic app and what they do is that they take all the important lessons from thousands of nonfiction books and they summarise them into these like 15 minutes summaries that you can either read or listen to so the way I use Blinkist is that if I ever come across a recommendation for a nonfiction book I search through Blinkist and see if I can find it and I add it to my library this is just a quick scroll through some of the books that I've read on Blinkist up for our work week and essentially they've summarised the salient points of the book in this series of like I don't know 15 13 13 blinks that you can read through in about 15 minutes if you're like me and you find yourself strapped for time and you have all these book recommendations being thrown at you and you just don't really know where to begin this is a great place to start where you can read a summary of the book get the most important lessons and if that's all you need and that's fine you can just take that away or if you want to find out more then you can actually buy the book and read it properly so yeah for our work week for our body Seth Gordon's marketing books seven habits of highly effective people that was one that I read on Blinkist it's a massive book I've never read it in real life but because I've read it on Blinkist I feel like I've got the main lessons from it so I haven't needed to read it in real life which has saved me about 100 hours in my life but yeah Blinkist is pretty great and if you want to try it then there's a link in the video description that's going to appear over here and the first to 100 people to use that link will get unlimited access to Blinkist the premium subscription where you've got access to all of their library of thousands of books completely free for one week and you can decide if you like it then if you do like it if you use my code I think then you'll get 25% off a paid subscription as well I'd recommend it I think there are a lot of lessons that you can gain from these nonfiction books I think the fact that they're all summarized in Blinkist means that it's very easy to access them and you know it does cost a bit of money for an annual subscription but if you're anything like me then you know ideas from a single book can completely change your life so you know why not why why why not go for it but yeah thank you Blinkist was sponsoring this video I think you guys are great and I'll continue to use Blinkist whenever I get a recommendation to decide if I then want to read the book so yeah that brings us to the end of this video thank you so much for watching this has been the first time I've tried doing like a book thing on the channel but as I said let me know if you have any comments I'd love to hear from you thanks for watching if you liked the video please give it a thumbs up if you haven't subscribed to the channel then please consider doing so have a lovely day and I'll see you in the next video goodbye
