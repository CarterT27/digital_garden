# Preparing for the SJT - Cambridge University medical student VLOG #21
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0WvM8ZezVU
This episode of The Vlog is loosely based around a day preparing for the Situational Judgment Test (SJT). We roam a little around Cambridge with camera in-hand, do a group revision session at a friend's house, meet with a Consultant transplant surgeon to discuss an app idea, and end with a trip to the ADC Theatre to see the Cambridge University Show Choir performing. Enjoy xx

PS: Chronologically, these events happen between episode 17 and 18. I've changed up the order a bit because I wanted the Christmas-themed videos to come out around Christmas time :)

## Transcript
 We're going to be spending the day preparing for the SJT, the situational judgment session. So, the SJT is an exam that all medical students in the UK have to take before graduation, but it makes up about half of the marks for a foundation application program. So, the question in the SJT are things like your consultant terms are turned up to work from what are the next five appropriate steps to take, or you're having the agreement with another reference, what steps would you do, and it's quite tricky because oftentimes the right answer and the wrong answer are pretty obvious, but then it's like the three options in the middle that you have to rank an order of appropriateness, and it can sometimes be a bit tricky because you know that those three answers are all wrong, you know that you wouldn't do them, but you have to think about which one you would do less than the others. Hello again, so we're in Lucia's house doing SJT practice, so we're just kind of sitting around the table, going over the question on the TV, having a group discussion about whether we agree with the marks scheme or just agree with the marks scheme. So yeah that's great, now it's about half-plus four, and a few hours time I'm going to be meeting with Ben, and a surgeon from Adam Brooks is just a casting app that we've made, there's some videos on the channel about that, but no one ever watches, but we'll talk about that closer to the time, see you in a bit. Okay, so we've had our meeting with the transplant surgeon, it went really, really well, he's a super inspiring guy who's done loads of things with like medical companies and stuff, and he's given us a lot of ideas on how we can kind of expand our idea for the app and make it bigger and better, so hopefully more on that to come in the very near future, so watch this space. Now it is about half-plus ten, and I'm just going to drive down to the ADC, which is the local theatre in Cambridge, because the Cambridge University show choir have their termly show, and the show choir is kind of like bleep-up, but like you know the Cambridge equivalent, so they're just like sing musical songs, Disney songs, pop songs in the sort of acpella style with lots of dancing, and it's awesome, so I love the show choir shows, and me and a few friends, we all going down. So we are a show choir, it's awesome, it's basically like pitch perfect, but in Cambridge. I'm really excited, I've never been to this before, Alice has amazing, so we want a lot of our Atlanta it has some onboarding so we're going to get a song,
