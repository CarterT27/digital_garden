## Transcript
 Oh, right so I've been on YouTube for around four years now and in that time I've made over 350 videos spent thousands and thousands of hours doing this filming editing thing and in that time I've even had 118 marriage proposals via email. It's been a really fun and rewarding and meaningful journey so far so thank you guys for supporting the channel and for being subscribers and stuff if you're not a subscriber please hit the subscribe button but in this video I want to share nine life lessons that I've learned over the past four years of being a YouTuber and these aren't lessons that are specific to if you want to be a YouTuber although I think you should these are just generally some good like personal developmently life advicey things that I've taken from from this journey so far so let's get into it. All right lesson number one is that haters are surprisingly uncommon when most people think about the idea of starting a YouTube channel they think oh my god what about all the hate comments and the thing that I realized pretty quickly is that there are very very few hate comments overall in general most people are nice most people are friendly most people have good intentions most of the time and yes occasionally you'll get the odd hate comment and it's kind of funny when you do but for the most part 99.99% of comments are like really really nice and I think this is actually a good way to live life generally a lot of us have this thing whereby we we see other humans with a little bit of suspicion and we think that oh this person that's a get me that person's bad this person's mean but actually if we if we really think about it most people have good intentions most of the time most people are nice it's all good the world is a happy and nice place and yes some bad things happen you shouldn't let that from stopping you from trusting people generally and sort of being open and vulnerable and all that kind of stuff and certainly for me if I hadn't made a YouTube channel because I was worried about the hate comments my life would be looking very differently right now and this is the same for every single other youtuber friend that I have we're all worried about hate comments initially and we realize this is actually not a huge deal general life advice across the board second piece of important life advice that I've learned from being on YouTube is for the most part no one actually cares before starting YouTube I was really worried like what are my friends and family and stuff gonna think and very quickly as I started making YouTube videos I realized no one actually cares like all these people who I thought were going to criticize me for having a YouTube channel and for having the audacity to put myself out there in public none of these people cared they're all worried about their own lives they're all doing their own thing and so I spent so much time thinking oh well these people are gonna think and I realize that they're just not thinking about me at all everyone's worried about their own life everyone is worried about their own stuff and again to abstract this away from YouTube into general life advice there are so many domains in life in which you and I we stop ourselves from doing something because we're worried about what people will think but if we just did the thing we'd realize that for the most part no one actually cares you're probably not going around judging people around you and if you are you need to stop it but for the most part no one cares it's all good you can take risks you can do things because you're the only one that really cares about yourself life less than number three from being a YouTuber is that when you give people value for free then really good things will happen and this is sort of what the whole model of YouTube is based around it's based around people sitting down in front of their cameras and making videos sometimes for years on end without getting any money or anything like that these days you have to hit a thousand subscribers and 4,000 hours of watch time that's quite hard it takes ages to get to a thousand subscribers it took me six months and 52 videos to get to a thousand subscribers before that point every single thing I was doing was providing value for free to people on the internet and if you're struggling to put yourself out there if you're struggling to make your business succeed if you're struggling to you know to be an entrepreneur you're probably thinking about it as like you know you have to be paid for the value that you provide and yes you probably should and an inner dream world all of us would be paid for the value that we that we provide but to be honest the people who are desperate to make money from providing value are probably also the people who are thinking I would never pay for an iPhone app why would I do that everything on the internet should be free and so the life lesson here is that when you give value to people for free really really good things happen that's the entire model of YouTube and Twitter and Instagram you've got to give value for free and afterwards you can worry about the monetization side of things life lesson number four from being a youtuber is that what is obvious to you can be amazing to others and I first learned this from my now friend Derek service who wrote this amazing book Hell Yeah or no what's worth doing in the main insight here is that like you know often when I make youtube videos I feel like the stuff that I'm talking about it's just really really obvious and this is just a you know it's the curse of knowledge as CS Lewis calls it the stuff that we take for granted the stuff that we know we kind of don't realize that there are some people out there who don't know the thing and so often what holds people back in when we're installing a youtube channel or a blog website twitter instagram put business putting yourself out there in any capacity often what holds people back is this idea that my thing is not valuable enough because it's really obvious other people already know this but you don't realize that actually most people don't know the thing that you know and so if you find a way to teach it to them or to provide them value preferably for free then people will latch onto that because it's a new novel and interesting thing so overall what's obvious to you can be absolutely amazing to others life lesson number five from being a youtuber is that everything absolutely everything is figure outable when I started on youtube four years ago I had no idea what a camera was I didn't know what shot a speed or ISO or aperture meant I did not know how to edit videos I did not know anything about sound design about microphones about background music I just learned all of that stuff by following free youtube tutorials and just sort of figuring it out based on google and youtube and other youtubers and you know classes on skill share and that kind of thing and again there are so many people I know who stopped themselves from starting a youtube channel or a website or a business because they're thinking oh I don't know how to do this thing but it's like it's not I don't know how to do this thing it's I don't know how to do this thing yet but I can figure it out because I can go on the internet and learn the thing because you can learn absolutely anything on the internet and this is something that really being youtuber over the part of over the last four years it helped me realize and fully fully internalize like I cannot imagine ever being in a situation now where I feel oh my god I don't know how to do this thing therefore I won't do it I'm always gonna think to myself I don't know how to do this thing yet I will figure it out and if I'm good enough having figured it out then I will do the thing so that's another life lesson for you life lesson number six is that you don't need to be an expert often again we hold ourselves back by thinking we have to be experts we have to be qualified we have to be a guru in the thing that we're talking about in order for other people to listen to us but what I've learned from being on youtube for the last four years and actually being a medical educator as well and teaching medical students and stuff is that often the people who are the best at teaching us are the people who are just one step ahead of us in the journey like if I'm having a medical tutorial from someone I actually learn much better if they're just one year ahead of me because they will really appreciate my beginner position they'll really appreciate where I'm coming from whereas if I have a lecture from a professor who's been doing it for 50 years chances are they're a little bit out of touch they don't really know what's going through my head what my struggles are and so I will learn from someone who is a guide rather than a guru and so whatever you're trying to do don't feel like you need to achieve a qualification to do it obviously you know don't be a brain surgeon unless you've got the qualification in the training but for the most part for things that aren't life and death you can figure it out everything is figure outable and you don't need to be an expert to teach or to talk about the thing that you want to talk about alright life advicey tip number seven from being a youtuber uh for this one I'm actually going to cut to an excerpt of my very first vlog on this channel they say that when whenever you're starting on youtube your first 50 videos are going to be terrible so I'm kind of hoping that over the next year I make my 50 terrible videos and then when we hit August the first 2018 when life is a junior doctor starts then I'd be able to kind of hit the ground running and then be able to actually film decent vlogs so that was me from 2017 saying that my first 50 videos were going to be terrible and I think again this doesn't just apply to youtube this applies to basically everything that we're ever going to do where you know there is that very sort of painful process at the start where we're on the steepest of the learning curve where the thing that we're doing is not going to be very good I started to try and learn art recently and become a concept artist and my art work is absolutely terrible it's really really really bad and I know that my first 50 or 100 500 or 1000 things are going to be terrible but I know that the process of doing them and producing this quantity is ultimately going to make me improve and ultimately going to lead to quality life lesson number eight from being a youtuber is the power of bringing others along with you for the journey the power of asking for help out you know at the moment I've got a team of eight people who help run this youtube business and the channel and the courses and everything else and that's like one level of working with other people but actually a lot sooner than you can hire people you can actually ask your friends for help so especially with my videos early on often I asked my friends who were around me at university to be my cameraman or camera women or to give me some ideas for content or for titles or for thumbnails and these guys and girls were very happy to get involved and it was kind of cool that oh at least making youtube videos it's probably going to fail oh isn't it kind of cute that he's like you know screwing his medical examples or making youtube videos but there was still keen to help with the idea generation and things and I think again journaly outside of youtube and full and and for life overall if we can ask the people around us for help for doing a thing then often they're just very happy to oblige we don't need to try and do everything ourselves and life lesson number nine that I've learned from being a youtuber is to really remember to have fun and to enjoy the journey if there's one thing I've learned about productivity and like success and stuff generally over the last like five years it's that productivity and success isn't really about doing more things it's about doing more of what matters to us and choosing or rather learning to have fun along the way as mylisaris says in about how fast to get there ain't about what's waiting on the other side it's the climb brand and standard sense as a journey before destination and I think that really embodies everything that I've learned from youtube over the last four years it really is a journey before destination again taking this outside the realm of youtube or whatever you're focusing on whatever you're working on if you're fixated on the destination you're actually probably unlikely to get there because like really it's the journey where the progress happens and if you're not enjoying the journey then either a you won't actually do it because it's not enjoyable or b you'll hate the journey you'll get to the destination and you'll realize that that destination was not actually the thing that you were seeking and really it's all about the journey overall so it sounds a bit hippie overall but really remember to have fun with whatever it is you're doing remember to have fun and remember to enjoy the this video was actually meant to be 14 life lessons rather than nine because I've got plenty more to talk about but I realized this video was getting a little bit too long and that's not very good for the youtube algorithm and so instead the other five life lessons you can find in the extended version of this video which is available over at nebula if you haven't heard nebula is an independent streaming platform that's built by me and a bunch of other creators that you might be familiar with Thomas Frank and Tom Scott and Wendover Productions and Legal Eagle and Lindsay Ellis and the idea behind nebula is that it gives us a place to put material that wouldn't necessarily work on youtube for example half an hour long video about 14 life lessons from being like having been on youtube over the last four years on nebula you'll also get early access to all of my videos completely ad free and so this ad gets taken out of this video and replaced with the other five life lessons and you'll also find a bunch of nebula exclusives like my workflow series where I take you through my workflow for using productivity apps like notion and room the best way to get access to nebula is to sign up to curiosity stream who are very kindly sponsoring this video now curiosity stream is the world's leading documentary streaming subscription platform they've got thousands of really high budget high quality documentaries that you can choose from and there's one series in particular that really enjoyed which is all about human performance and how we can maximize our kind of potential by doing interesting things with that brain but the really cool thing about curiosity stream is that they support independent creators and so they've got a bundle deal with nebula which means that if you sign up for curiosity stream which is 15 like less than $15 for the whole year you get free access to nebula bundled with that so if less than $15 a year you get thousands of high quality high budget documentaries and curiosity stream and also a ton of really good exclusive stuff along with the extended edition of this video over in nebula if that sounds good and you want to check it out then head over to curiositystream.com forward slash alley and sign up for your account and then you'll get your nebula details emailed to you so thank you curiosity stream
