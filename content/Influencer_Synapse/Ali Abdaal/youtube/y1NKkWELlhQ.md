## Transcript
 Hey friends, welcome back to the channel and this video we're talking about two mental models that I find helpful for thinking about how to approach opportunities and how to take advantage of them so that we can ultimately leave healthier happier and more productive lives. First is the idea of door knockers versus window openers and I first came across this idea on the my first million podcast which is fantastic link in the video description. The idea is that there's two sorts of people in the world. There are the window openers and the door knockers. So window openers are the ones who would look through a window. They would see something on the other side and then the open window and kind of reach in and get the thing that they want. The important thing is that they can see the results before they open the window and therefore they open the window. On the other hand we've got the door knockers and the door knockers when it comes to exploring opportunities are the ones who are open to kind of knocking on doors and then opening the door and seeing what's behind it without knowing what's behind it in advance. So that's kind of the key difference. Like if you're a window opener you see the outcome before you see it. If you're a door knocker you're all right with opening the door even though you don't know what the outcome is and this is sort of like the two different sorts of ways that we approach opportunities increasingly in the world that we live in today. There are far more opportunities for success. However we want to define that to the people who door knock rather than the people who window open. For something stupid like that like you know starting a YouTube channel that's very much a door knocking kind of thing like you really cannot see where it's gonna lead you but you just have to kind of go for it. There's all sorts of kind of random luck events that can happen to us where we don't know what's on the other side but if we approach it from a I'm a door knocker mentality rather than I'm a window open a mentality then life gets better. And I think that for people like me like in medicine which is a very traditional field we're all very much the window openers. So like for example when I started my YouTube channel the first question my mom would have been asking is like what's the point of this where's it gonna lead? It could often if I'm giving a talk somewhere and I say that everyone should have a personal website for various reasons the question and everyone's minds is oh but you know how long would it take me to get to success you know what the success looked like? Like they want the path to be chartered out in front of them and only then will they do it? But you know like stuff like this creating content on the internet, starting a business it's all inherently uncertain things that the door knocker mentality is more suitable to. Now at this point I want to cut to a segment that I did with my friend Bobby Seagull he was actually my college at university and we did a deep dive interview I think last month. Um Bobby became famous because he was on a TV show in the UK called University Challenge and in that that year his team did really well for my college at manual college, Walton Bobby. The team did really well but he came out as like the team captain who was very charismatic and very cool and there was another guy on the show as well who was also very became famous and together these guys Monkman and Seagull they then started appearing all these TV shows and started getting book deals and stuff and then Bobby was appearing like like loads like TV shows and and newspapers and magazine that interviews and he's became and has become a big name in the field of education and so during the interview I asked him to what extent was his current success the fact that he's like a well-known educational figure in the UK to what extent is that current success a result of the luck of being becoming famous on it versus kind of the stuff that he did afterwards and I think his response was very interesting. I think it was a combination of two because often people need a bit of luck to be in the bike place at the right time of course that was there in terms of I was there my series and I had a very munkerman the captain of Walton's bought us emerging in the same time and they helped us but then it's how do you deal with that platform? Is it getting every year there are two or three people that emerge and had their mom in the spotlight Andy Warhol's 15 minutes but I think what I think made me perhaps different was that again I changed careers I'd left investment banking charge of the currency to become a teacher and I wanted to make an impact in education but on the University challenge when I first emerged a lot of people said oh can we get you on to do an interview here can you buy an article for us can you come to Manchester and again I've changed my view slightly since then but I was very much a yes man in someone gave me an opportunity I would make it happen they would say Bobby we need you in the studio at six a.m. and it's like 10 and it's not 11 o'clock in night so I need to leave the house at 430 and I would say yes to opportunities and the more I said yes to things people said he's believable and okay one I delivered on the program or if I did an article it was a good article but I would deliver and I would I would never say no I get the impression that the fact that you cultivated this sort of like essentially being a yes man meant that you would the reliable go to guy for anything to do with like education or like you're schooling and things like that is is that fair to say? The media is again people have asked me for my opinion on education my opinion on budgets again I was asked a couple of years ago to go on any question and nobody has one sort of off center candidate maybe a really famous comedian but this little Bobby we've got something on education budget um do you want to come on the show and again I'm not a politician but again I said yes I'll shoot and obviously I was very nervous but then since then I've been asked to do more education things so again I think it's it is they're saying yes to things and delivering and then people then will come back for further again further education things again I now do work I'm a ambassador for the Premier League and so we can clearly see here that Bobby is being a door knocker he's saying yes to all these random opportunities that are coming up without worrying oh is this really going to be good for my career you just kind of say yes and eventually you know good things will happen and here's another really interesting example it's being prepared to go with the you know the knocks and the punches and if an opportunity presents herself don't always sniff it down for example I've got a abortion here which is a lot of items if anyone knows I'm not advocating any watching what I'm having as a teacher but it is a it's a show that gets like three and a half four million viewers but anyway but when I became known as a public gig cause it weren't you know I'm very proud and I'm happy to defend gigs um I was invited to take part in a parody show called geek island and it's like a tongue and cheek show where you've got people that meant to be hot whatever but are smart and instead and again I had a whisk by taking it because you could go on to show that embarrasses you and you look silly and then you damage your brand I knew a reputation I'm running and I took the gamble I bent on it and then since then I've been seeing as someone that can advocate geekery people that are geeks and nerds I'm happy to stand up and represent them so again that was the brisk like took and I go off with it and I took it and it could have that fight it could have been a disaster it could have been like a love wildest show when I got away you know a top of the shit program but it wasn't it was all it was all managed well and then since then I've become again someone that in the public eye if any someone to represent geeks and a positive light you can you know to show that basically there are nothing we're being a geek that loves studying full-time but I like trying to show the sort of the joe of your side of being a geek so again perfect example he could have said no to that opportunity he could have worried about the reputational damage that I might cause but he said yes and good things happened as a result of it and so the first mention model that I said we were going to talk about was donut Christmas window openers the second one is a concept called return on luck and this is from a book called Great by choice by guy called Jim Collins and in this book they looked at what is the difference like what makes companies good or great and they found that if you looked at all those sort of representative companies the difference between apple and a company that you've never heard of is not that apple got lucky breaks it's that apple was able to take advantage of those lucky breaks a lot better than the competitor could and so they found all these industries and they looked at all these examples and they found that the number of luck events the number of opportunities that came their way it was basically exactly the same but so but certain companies certain individuals were able to capitalize on that luck at a little bit more to an extent we can't really control when a lucky break hits us we can by sort of increasing a random surface area for randomness and optionality and stuff but more on that in another video but we can't really control luck events as they happen to us but we can control how we respond to them and we can control our return on luck and the more that we sort of take advantage of these lucky breaks the better off will be so in with Bobby for example he got the lucky break of being on university challenge had the right place at the right time and that started off this kind of rocket ship so yeah two important mental models door knockers versus window openers and return on luck and I'd love to hear from you in the comments if you've got any thoughts about how this relates to your own life or any kind of ways that examples in which you've found this to be true for yourself and for other people if you like this video you might like to check out the full conversation with Bobby along with I think like 15 different little bite size chunks on nebula more details in the video description if you want to watch more stuff on YouTube you might like my book club series which is in playlist over here it's very short there's only a few videos in there we're talking about some of my favorite in all the fiction books two of these are two of them and I kind of summarized the insights and highlights from those so thank you for watching and I'll see you in the next video bye
