Hey! We're Ben and Ail, fifth year Cambridge medical students on our medical elective. Over the next few weeks, we're going to build an app for medical students, and we'll be sharing our process as we go along.

## Transcript
 Hello everyone. My name is Ali. I'm Ben and we are medical students from Cambridge University We are in our fifth year and we are on our medical elective in Cambodia Which is really really fun. We've just come up with a really good idea for an app that we're going to make And we're going to share the details of it with you Okay, so come into Cambodia everybody's been saying that they wish they've written down all the surgeries that they've done So while I've been here being the very key medical student that I am I've tried to every day But then this Excel spreadsheet with lots and lots of columns just so I can get a record about four of the surgeries that we've been able to do I've been here and apparently this is something that students do in the UK as well common advice from surgical societies Is that if if you're interested in surgery as a special team and you see operations or you assist in operations You should probably make a list of them somewhere just as a record So if by the end of your medical school career you've done let's say I don't know 200 assists You don't want those to go to waste completely you can just kind of print out a list put it in your portfolio when you're applying for a job Stuff like that. Yeah, so it's a nice thing just to bring along with you And it's quick and easy for them to look at and be like bang look on plastic surgery So I've done for example problem with the current system is that if you want to do this You have to know what to do Like I only got the advice about halfway through fifth year that you should be keeping one of these surgery But look look the other problem is that even if you know what to do it's a bit of a pain in the bum to fill out this spreadsheet when you get home Yeah, sure you can launch the Google sheet time when you're phone and that's what a few of us I've done but it's just it's not an easy input system So a common problem that I find out how as well when setting up a spreadsheet What do I need to include? I need to include the patient name probably not Identifiers where it was how do I describe what surgery I've been part of so you'll be very nice if there was It's spreadsheet that already had all these columns on it so that it's nice and easy You just input the data or the details that you need to and bang your away quick and easy So we're gonna make that that does exactly that it's gonna be a nice simple app that runs on iOS and Android Which connects to a backhand database where you pretty much restore the details of all the operations that you've assisted in as a medical student Let's say you've just done an operation You go on the app just enter the patient random identifier number, which is It's fine because there's no actual patient data associated with it and you just type in an email You supervise or other person to watch your surgery and it sends it to the database automatically records the date the time the hospital that you're at And then you have a lockbook We'd like to document the process of building this app to share with you guys via video We know that a lot of students, a lot of medical students are particularly interested in med tech and in the idea of making apps But it seems like a lot of people don't really know where to start and have haven't really done it before and from speaking to people It seems a lot of people want to learn how to code We're doubly know how to take something from an idea to product So we'd like to share all the details with you by a video Leave them the doubts and some of the reasons why we do what we're doing and and how it works And what are these just to explain it's pretty much my situation so since I've been here I've learned a lot already in terms of just building a website for example And I quite like to get to know a bit about how starting up a new project works as well And so this is really good opportunity for me And I'd love to see how it gets itself Yeah, and in terms of academics experience I've coded a few websites before But I've never actually made an app before I was around for it So there'll be an interesting learning with me and we're hoping that by kind of sharing the process with you guys Giving you a look at the kinds of scenes about how we make an app We're hoping that that'll be useful And while we're building it if it's something that it looks like You know you are home could easily do with it's something that you feel like you've been missing out as well And then I think you could be one of our best users We haven't actually worked out a name for this yet We'll do another video on that But when we do there will be a website named somewhere on screen I'm like here here in everyone Once we found a name Please go on that website put in your email address And we'll send you emails today you know when things are done So you can start adding to your surgical look Yeah, so thanks for watching We'd love it if you stayed with us and we kept you in the loop about this project to us And maybe it'll become something very useful Hopefully Well maybe not by the way We'll be back with something We'll make some videos, it'll be fun So yeah, thanks for watching I will see you in the next one Bye
