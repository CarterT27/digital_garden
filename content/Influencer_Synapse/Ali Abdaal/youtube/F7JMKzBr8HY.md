## Transcript
 Hey friends, welcome back to the vlog, so the day is a Monday and we're going to be doing a little day in the life. So at the moment it's 9 a.m. and we're chilling in like this area which is the business lounge in the building that I live in. So the theory is that this is where I'll go each morning to help to make myself sit down and write because if you didn't know I'm in the process of writing a book, then half past 10, we've got a weekly team kickstarter meeting, which is basically an all-hands meeting where some of us in person and some of us remotely, we all join. So everyone the team gets together and we talk about what's going on. Today I'm going to be giving a spiel about what our core values are as a business and doing like a Q&A with the team, if anyone has any questions about like our kind of direction and organizational parity and this sort of thing. Then we have a meeting with a chap called Dan who helped code my website and we're working on some sort of collaboration where we design and code themes for Ghost, which is a website builder that I've been using since like 2015. Then for three hours in the afternoon from 12 to 3 we have a YouTube content brainstorm meeting where we've got a bunch of the team together in person, we're going to order deliverer and for the first time we're trying this out as like an in person thing where by we sort of brainstorm content ideas and see what progress we've got on all the various videos we've got in production. Never we've done that before but my friend Taha who is also youtuber and has a bunch of experience leading these sorts of meetings it's going to be leading it so we'll see how that goes. Then at 4pm I have an interview on a famous person's podcast which will be fun. Then at 5pm we've got our leadership team meeting which is from 5 to 630 and then from 630 to 8pm I have a one-on-one with Angus who's our kind of operations. All basically back to back meetings from like 1030 up until 8pm but hey it's going to be fun we're going to have a good day and this is what is what Dan the life at least on a Monday looks like. We've got our team all hands meeting we call it the kick stop meeting because it's like we're kick starting week and I just add a bit more flair to it as well we all get together we do we spend a few minutes just quickly updating everyone on what's going on in the business on like the youtube channel the podcast the youtuber academy the courses like this all the various things that we do this time around it's kind of new because I'm doing this like core value speech where I've you know we've like five core values within the team and I need to do a little spiel explaining them all to people and explaining why they're important and stuff and then we're going to have a segment talking about kind of doing a little Q&A just to make sure everyone's on the same page about everything and it's sort of being open and almost and stuff. Essentially what we've been doing is trying to figure out like what are we actually doing here what's the point where we're going and we've landed on and I think I've mentioned this to a few of you we've landed on the idea of like does this thing help people live the best life through creating inspiring and educational content we're only going to put up videos if they are excellent and like very good and authentic not defined by external metrics defined by our own feeling of is this available video to that that would help people live the best life is it inspiring and educational that's kind of what we're about no dreams of world domination no dreams of I don't know hitting a billion people or 100 million people or 10 million people or any any numbers like that no real dreams of like revenue or like team size or anything literally just build a profit of the business and help people more have a fun alright so teamy's got the first time we kind of did this sort of format I gave my spiel about core values which lasted about half an hour maybe even longer but I thought it's reasonable I feel like I gathered my own thoughts while doing it as well and people seem to have made it enjoyed it at least that's what the telling me right now but we'll see so we've just wrapped up a meeting with Dan and Dan is one of my internet friends and he was in Mauritius and he's a ghost developer of ghost is like sort of like WordPress sort of like Squarespace but I've been using ghost to host my themes to host my website since like 2015 and I'm like mates with the guy runs ghost his name's John we've got an interview with him on the youtube channel anyway Dan and I and the team we're working together to try and design our own ghost themes so I always get emails from people being like oh my god how did you make your website it looks so sick or like you know that kind of stuff so the theme that we created like I designed it and Dan coded it for the website we're gonna sell it like a premium ghost theme and we're also thinking about you know given that we want to encourage people to use ghost can we make our own themes for ghost like that have our kind of like aesthetic so like light notiony kind of vibes so we're just figuring out like details well that looks like and kind of brainstorming out our first couple of themes so yeah kind of exciting we're now going to whip up a Shopify store probably where we can settle the stuff and then we're also planning to do video documenting the process of what it's like to try and sell digital products on the internet because it's a thing that a lot of rodents and for you guys might be potentially interested in so absolutely busting for a wee wee now because we've had back back meetings for a while and I've just been drinking all this water that Gordon has kind of he's applied so now we meet him all right isn't that like the standard opinion Tennis whipped has she got hit it yeah it's not fair I was that what that's almost about it wasn't a dance song oh yes I didn't really like the song yeah okay now I get the vibe we're going for um can we okay so let's I wonder if we do this instead as I thought sort of more of rather than a how I did X video and sort of trying to sort of fake footage of my experiences on dates and stuff instead we do like a how to where it's like we're taking insights from Logan's book and we're taking my personal experience having done the online dating thing for about six months and spoken to a bunch of people who have done it for longer than that sort of in three parts number one is maybe there's a thing about like why bother with online dating and the answer there is because it's an absolute no brainer and you're if you don't you know as far as I'm concerned um number two is throwing a shade on people in this room who are single and not on on on on their dating apps number two is setting ourselves up for success on these apps and we can use advice from Logan's book where she has a thing about this optimizing profile and actually I have theories on why paying for premium at paying for premium on apps is like the way forward like this is literally one of the most decisions one of the most important decisions of your life why would you not give yourself a better chance by paying a few quid all right so we've just finished off our first ever in person content kind of right to his room meeting it's been good it's like three hours we had lunch ordered from deliverer for everyone while we were here basically just sort of went through all the ideas we've got in our system tell hi introduce us to the new system we've got a notion the content production engine and we're just trying to find the way to uh yeah pitch ideas and brainstorm on things uh that uses the fact that we now have our writers who can do some research on stuff and also so we've got like our system where it takes ideas that I've come up with throughout the week and our writers are also coming up with ideas throughout the week and we're figuring out like how do we turn this into a video that really adds a value to our audience and how do we add my like personal touch to all the things we want to do if it's a topic that I know a lot about and if it's not a topic that I know a lot about but we think it's a still a valuable video can we include I don't know expertise from a book like this book Hatchon O'Dyle and by Logan Yuri we're interviewing her in the podcast in a few weeks can we interview other people can we introduce experts can we do that kind of stuff because ultimately the aim is to create inspiring educational content and help people live their best life and if it's a topic that I'm not familiar with then only to bring out the people on board for that so that's yeah pretty successful meeting I think overall nice to have everyone in person definitely feel more energized as a result compared to on zoom calls and now I wonder if we should do some filming or it's like allow it and chill for an hour or so or 45 minutes we'll see I do have I do have friend who just you know successful series be $100 million startup type vibes saying to me that hey I want to start a YouTube channel and I was like dude why the how do you want to start a YouTube channel he was like well once you've got a funded startup like surprisingly your autonomy is limited because you're now be holding to investors and so I really want my own thing that I can maybe make an online course off of so I can have my own income without it being tied to anyone else but also on that note I think I think this point you make about how everyone's trying to get more autonomy I was at a youtuber convention last week and it was a bunch of sort of youtubers who are all fairly successful by youtube metrics and the vibe there was let's try and figure out a way to build a brand that is distinct from our personal brand like a much company or a coffee company or a stationary company so that we can use our brand to market the thing but that the thing is not dependent on our own personal brand because even with you know creators like youtubers influencers it is in a way you get into it because of the autonomy but then you realize oh crap I'm continuing on this hamster wheel of content and I'm so entrenched in it now that I would love to build a brand but that's actually outside of me a few days ago I was like a Saturday I was here in the studio and I was meant to film a video and I thought you know I need to just spend five hours journaling about what I want from my youtube channel and the business and my life moving forward and what I realized is that even though with these multiple income streams you know I can actually do what I want and sort of explore my creative life and all that kind of stuff I found myself continuing to be a slave to the algorithm because I wanted the numbers to go up and I was thinking what the hell's going on here like you know I'm beyond the point of income streams where I you know comfortably sustain a decent lifestyle for a few years that's all great if I were if you told me for years ago I'd be at this point I'd have had a stroke and yet I was still just my default mode was oh well two minutes subscribers is cool but like four minutes subscribers is even better and oh you know this many income streams is good that like twice as many as even better and I kept on thinking that oh you know if I had if I had 10 million in the back then I would get to a point where I feel like I've got enough money and then I I was just I was just trying to reflect on this thing that this is just so absurd and the conclusion that I came to after all this like journaling was I actually can just decide to not care about the numbers to not worry about publishing videos on a consistent schedule sticking to sponsorship deadlines because of the cares and I actually can now switch to only making videos that I feel authentic and that I proud of. Yeah thank you for the advice I will I'm sure I'll keep providing you with emails closer to the time if you're like right and I need a title that we are you got it yeah this was this was so awesome I'm glad you connected and however I can help with the button just in the app yeah thanks for having me all oh yeah right so just finished the interview with Ryan Holiday for his podcast slash youtube channel side with all sort of the same thing on his daily stuff stuff it was really interesting I I love talking right we spoke and I think twice before once on a interview on my channel and once kind of off the cuff and he's just like been it in the writing and marketing game for so long he just has the sort of this enormous treasure trove of information inside his head and it is in his no taking system and it's just so good at giving advice like very to the point advice on the book writing process every time I speak to him I come away with more like yeah inspiration that yeah I've got to get this thing out and his whole thing is you know it should take six months to write the first draft of the book if it takes longer than that you're just kind of screwing around so I've got to put in the work over the next six months fingers crossed something will come out of it and I might even try dabbling with his physical note taking system on flash cards and boxes and things like that right next order of business it's five o'clock got a leadership team meeting with the Dan and Angus so Angus is ahead of operations Dan is my executive assistant but he's also kind of our head of HR head of legal head of finance all of those things combined into one so three of us me every one day for ninety minutes and we do a leadership team meeting and the both here in person so it'll be more high energy probably than it usually is over a zoom call so next step leadership team meeting well we're not at that point yet in the meeting agenda now I can I can say why uh basically it actually has been because of all of these videos for trials that we've been having which have eaten into uh all so I've not been waking up at seven a.m. yeah yeah I think I think we switch to eight I think eight a.m. is doable eight a.m. writing time because writing time from seven a.m. I realize means I have to wake up at six thirty which is just never gonna happen well why not because I requires me sleeping at ten thirty which is a counter counter to my social life. All right so we're just wrapped up our weekly leadership team meeting with me Angus and Dan first time actually doing it in person because Dan lives in Wales so he's come down because we've got another business session business coaching session tomorrow is like an all day event the leadership team pretty good tack on the bunch of issues pretty productive and now the day is gonna end it's now six 42 p.m. with the final one and one between me and Angus so I guess we'll probably say goodbye here we're probably gonna order some food and then he and I will chat about the things that he and I chat about both days so thanks for watching the blog click it for a playlist of more day in the life logs to leave a comment down below if you'd like to see more of this sort of stuff let's do this sort of stuff anything else you'd like to see added or removed from these little videos but thanks again for watching and see you later bye bye
