Kindle (2019) - https://geni.us/amgs

In this video, we're taking a quick look at Amazon's latest Kindle (2019) and comparing it to the 2018 Kindle Paperwhite. As I say right at the start, it's no contest - if you're in the market for a Kindle, you should get the Paperwhite and totally ignore the Kindle. Enjoy xx

## Transcript
 Hey guys, welcome back to the channel. If you're new here, my name is Ali. I'm a junior doctor working in Cambridge and in this video I'm gonna be comparing the Amazon Kindle 2019 budget edition with the latest Amazon Kindle paper white And this is gonna be a really short video and the reason it's gonna be a really short video is because there is literally no comparison between these two If you're in the market for a Kindle, you should buy the Kindle paper white You should forget about this budget 2018 Kindle the main reason I feel so strongly about this is because This budget Kindle has a screen resolution of 167 pixels per inch compared to the Kindle paper white Which has a screen resolution of 300 pixels per inch so when you compare 167 with 300 you see a noticeable difference I'll link to the verge review of the Kindle they say that reading on the 2019 Kindle feels like looking at an at an old computer screen Whereas reading on the Kindle paper white feels like reading it feels like reading on a piece of paper and I could not agree more with that this is the 2019 Kindle the cheap one the one that's like $89 or 79 pounds it genuinely makes my eyes want to bleed it's like back in the day if you had the old MacBook Air and then you switched to a written a MacBook Pro But then you looked back at your MacBook Air display You would notice that it's just so so bad and that's the feeling with this 2019 Kindle Yeah, it'll save you 30 pounds of 40 dollars if you get it but honestly Given that the only function of a Kindle is to read books You might as well go for something that has a pleasurable resolution of 300 pixels per inch rather than a crappy resolution of 167 pixels per inch More differences between these two Kindles the paper white is waterproof the normal Kindle is not I don't really think the waterproofness is a big deal I've been using my 2015 Kindle paper white which also has a 300 pp resolution I've been using that in the bathtub of him taking on holiday everywhere I haven't submerged it in water, but when would you need to submerge a Kindle in water? That pretty much brings us to the end of this video. I don't want to take up too much of your time If you're in the market for a Kindle, please do yourself a favor Do not get this Kindle throw away instead get the Kindle paper white. This is wonderful The Kindle is is honestly one of the most valuable pieces of technology. I have ever bought in my life In fact after the camera that I first bought in my fourth year of med school Which kickstarted my youtube channel the Kindle is the single most valuable piece of tech I have ever bought because it's just You know allowed me to read books so so easily and yeah some people say that oh I don't want to get a Kindle because I like the feel of a paper book in my hand and I like the weight smells and all that stuff and I Used to think this as well until I got a Kindle and realized that yeah, you don't get that smell of a book But honestly when you're reading a book at least for me is far more about the content of the book and far less about the fact that I'm reading a book Maybe if you want to romanticize reading a book then find but honestly this will change your life It just reduces the friction to reading books to the point where it's so minimal like every time I hear a new book recommended on a podcast or by friend I literally just log into the Amazon thing on my phone and I just buy on Kindle I don't even look at the price because it's so irrelevant how much a book costs anymore because the amount of value You can potentially get from a book. It's just astronomical anyway. I have talked about a Kindle long enough I have done another video where I talk about five recommended tech for students and I talked about the Kindle in that More of the story if you're in the market for an Amazon Kindle, please do yourself a favor and go for the paper white This one not for the normal Kindle this one paper white is absolutely worth the extra 30 pounds of $40 And actually often on Amazon Black Friday sales on Amazon Prime Day and stuff the Kindle prices get slashed So if money is an object then you can just pick up a paper white for cheap But please do yourself a favor and don't buy this 2019 Kindle. It's just not worth it So thanks for watching. I hope you found this video useful If you like the video please give it a thumbs up if you haven't subscribed to the channel then please consider doing so Have a lovely day and I'll see you in the next video. Goodbye
