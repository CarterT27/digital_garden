## Transcript
 Hey friends welcome back to the channel so I recently read Elon Musk's biography and there are a bunch of lessons from the chat that we can learn from about how he's built this ridiculous roster of companies. So in this video we're launching a new series on the channel called Case Studies where we distill and discuss wisdom from cool people all around the world and in this episode we're going to go over 10 life lessons that Elon Musk uses some for productivity, some for general life and some kind of meta things that we can learn from hopefully to help live our own best lives. And so lesson number one is that being ridiculously successful doesn't automatically make your life and there's this thing that we all have a tendency to do which is that we lie in ice people like Elon Musk and Steve Jobs and we think that because these people have made it by traditional metrics in society we should therefore kind of look to them as role models as people to aspire to and I think that's all well I'm good but I think what's really interesting about Elon is that when he's asked an interviews about how he does his stuff he often says that he wouldn't actually recommend his lifestyle to a lot of people and he has what he says about people that want to try and be like him. If somebody wants to be me or do the things I've done I would say most probably you're mistaken you do not want to do that you'd have to have some kind of like rage demon in your skull that you just gotta get it done. So obviously our friend Elon is really successful but it sounds like he wouldn't actually particularly recommend his lifestyle to a lot of people and this ties in with a really cool concept called Pixel Theory which I read about on the fantastic blog week but why by Tim Urban. Now the idea here is that life is a picture but we live in a pixel and when we think of someone like Elon Musk or Mark Zuckerberg or whatever we we think of the whole picture of their lives that are this is the richest person in the world and they've got all this power and influence and fame and prestige and they seem to do cool things we think of it in broad broad big picture terms but what Tim Urban says in the blog post is that we live in an individual pixel and these people live in an individual pixel of that entire picture and so it's really less about the grand narrative of someone's life that contributes to whether they are happy and fulfilled and find meaning of the life and stuff and it's a lot more about what they're doing day to day and so this is why this is the lesson number one because even though we're doing the series where we're trying to distill wisdom from famously successful people around the world we want to take all of their stuff with a bit of a pinch of salt and recognize that obviously the journey is more important than the destination and if Elon is saying to be well that he won't recommend his lifestyle we shouldn't be so quick to try and line eyes it and think that this is the model for how we should live so with that caveat in mind which actually applies to absolutely everything you ever hear on the internet or on interviews and stuff everyone is just speaking from their own life experience and you know we can we can choose the important bits that resonate with us and we can apply to our own lives but we shouldn't be so quick to try and adopt absolutely everything in the life philosophy so with that caveat said let's move on to lesson number two and lesson number two is that having a shower is really the best thing ever so when Elon was doing a reddit AMA someone asked what daily habit you believe has had the largest positive impact on your life and Elon Musk official simply replied with showering I couldn't find any more quotes about specifically the showering thing but there's a bunch of articles that other people have written talking about how Elon friggin loves his daily shower and how he gets him into the right headspace and how if he doesn't have his shower he feels like you know he doesn't have his ideas his feels like his creativity is not unlocked and all this kind of stuff around having a shower just to not do I just to kind of stand there in the shower do you have long showers? I do actually. I do not have long showers. That's wrong. And this was interesting because for me like this morning I had like a three-hour long writing session because I'm working on my book and in between the writing session I had a shower and I like to take my time of the shower I spent about 15-20 minutes in the shower just like enjoying it and mulling over some of the ideas and part of me was thinking hmm this having a shower thing is not very productive because I should be writing my book here and then I was thinking like what the hell is wrong only why why why why thinking that having a shower is not being productive like the point of life is not to be productive every single second of the day having a shower is something that I enjoy I look you're at in the water the conditioner brushing my teeth in the shower to be a bit more productive that kind of thing and I also realised that I was getting a bunch of ideas in the shower that I could then incorporate into the book and speaking of showers the water that we spend in the shower often ends up in the ocean and the oceans are in a very bad state and that's why this video is in support of hashtag team sees which is an initiative by creators all around the world led by Mr. Beast and Marthrobot to try and clear out ¬£30 million of trash from our seas around the world so for every dollar that the campaign raises there's going to be one less pound of plastic in the oceans and if you want to donate head over to teamsees.org or there might even be a donation button under this video if that works nicely. This video is actually sponsored by CuriosityStream but they have very kindly allowed us to replace the plug for CuriosityStream with the plug for teamsees and I'll be donating all the proceeds from the CuriosityStream video to teamsees as well so if you want to help this initiative all these creators all around the world of clearing up the oceans and making sure that your shower water goes into a clean ocean rather than a dirty ocean filled with trash head over to teamsees.org or hit the donation button down below somewhere in the video description and let's try and get this to $30 million. If you're interested then half the money that we raise is going to go to the ocean conservancy and they're going to focus their efforts on clearing up the beaches and the oceans and the other half is going to an agency called the ocean clean up which is focusing on rivers because apparently 80% of the plastic in the world seas comes from 1% of rivers and so if we keep if we can target the rivers and get rid of the trash from there we will actually make a big difference on the ocean scale as well. It's a pretty cool initiative a friend Elon is obviously a big fan of saving the planet as well and it's kind of nice that all of us creators can band together and do something cool and raise money for genuinely a very good course to hashtag save the planet hashtag teamsees all that stuff. Anyway let's move on to lesson number three from Elon which is that reading is the best thing ever. Now it was a cool interview with Elon where someone asked him how he founded SpaceX a rocket company without a background in rocket science and his response was something along the lines of uh I read a book about it. And this is something that really comes through in his biography where when when when they talk about his early life I think that really stood out to me was just how much he enjoys reading and just was just like devouring books from the age of like three onwards. Here's a quote from the book the most striking part of Elon's character as a young boy was his compulsion to read from a very young age he seems to have a book in his hands at all times. It was not unusual for him to read 10 hours a day said Kimball. If it was the weekend he could go through two books in a day and here's another quote where Elon himself is speaking he says that at one point I ran out of books to read at the school library and the neighborhood library. This is maybe the third of fourth grade. I tried to convince the librarian to order books for me so then I started to read the inside the pediatrician Britannica that was so helpful you don't know what you don't know you realize there are all these things out there. Now obviously it would be a big fan of reading here on the channel and whenever I listen to interviews or read books from people who are famously successful they always say that reading has absolutely changed their life and they always say that they don't know a single other person who is successful who doesn't also say that reading has absolutely changed their life so you know I still get a bunch of messages and emails and stuff from people and Instagram and Twitter are being like oh you know I only read like one book the CO2 books to see how do you find more time to read all that kind of stuff to be honest my biggest tip for this is get Kindle and spend half an hour before bed each night reading because it's a good way of falling asleep and if you do that you can get through quite a lot of books very quickly so worth doing Elon Big fan of reading. Let's say number four is to have a clear vision for the stuff that we're doing. Elon is a really interesting example here because his vision for SpaceX is to make humanity a multi planetary species and his vision for Tesla was to help accelerate the transition to renewable energy. These are both pretty big vision type things but often if you ask someone or if you if you think yourself if you're watching this what is my vision for life? It's that's genuinely a really hard question to answer and it feels like and at least to me when I want you to think about it is to think god I have no idea like how like I'm I'm personally not interested in like affecting mass change in the world and all that kind of stuff. There were a couple of exercises that I found helpful to help me figure out like a life vision shall we say and it still sounds a little bit cringey to say it. The first one is the Gravestone technique which is to ask yourself what do I want written on my Gravestone and that's actually a fun question to actually think about. What would you actually want written on your Gravestone? When I do that I land on about three things some combination of good father or good husband and inspirational teacher and it was doing that exercise that made me realize oh maybe the thing that I really value above all else is well apart from the good husband good dad stuff is being a teacher and that gave me a lot of clarity because it helped me realize that actually maybe practicing medicine as a doctor is not necessarily my calling and teaching stuff maybe on the internet maybe in real life is more of the thing that really resonates with me and so when thinking what I want to do with my life I've kind of kept that in the back of my mind and the other exercise that's quite useful for this is the funeral technique which is to ask yourself what do you want people to say at your funeral? This is also kind of helpful in terms of figuring out a life vision figuring out what sort of person we want to be and the third one while we're on this topic is the Wikipedia technique which is to ask yourself what do you want written on your Wikipedia page what would be cool when you have a Wikipedia page about the stuff that's written on it and these things I find kind of helpful I'm not going to share my own personal life vision in this because it's kind of a personal thing and it's I sound really cringe when I say but maybe in a future video we'll talk about that but anyway Elon talks a lot about how having a clear vision is one of the things that drives him I don't think any of us are going to have as like grandiose a vision for I don't know making humanitarian colonized humanity colonized Mars as Elon well but even so having some kind of vision and thinking about it just a little bit might potentially help us alright lesson five is the micro scheduling method and basically in a bunch of articles and interviews that he's done he'll talk about how he schedules his day or rather his assistant probably schedules his day into a five minute blocks so that there is something happening in every five minute chunk he probably takes us a bit too far he even like has lunch in a five minute slot and usually has lunch and side meetings and most of us probably don't want to be that hardcore when it comes to scheduling our days I personally think for me my life five minute chunks is not enough time but I do really stand by the idea of scheduling our day and running our day based on our calendar and deciding in the morning what we want to do with that time in that day so that we're not spending the rest of the day thinking heart I wonder what I should be doing right now and I'm going to try the five minute thing at some point there was actually a report record hidden field we tried this and wrote an article on entrepreneur.com about this I'll link it in the description if you want to check it out seem kind of interesting but I do like the idea of trying out the five minute schedule and see if it makes a difference but the broad overall point is that scheduling stuff into our day and using our daily calendar as a way of helping us figure out what we want to do with that time and intentionally deciding that ahead of time rather than in the moment is often a way to be more effective if that's the thing that you care about. Now lesson number six was going to be to get really good at email because at various points Elon has said in articles and an interview that he loves a synchronous communication he doesn't do phone calls he doesn't do meetings he really likes email because he can he can like reply to email while he's on his phone and a cab or something and it doesn't rely on two people like actually getting together and talking but in a recent interview that Elon did with Shreer and Krishnan who is a new friend of mine and one of the partners at Andreessen Horowitz he actually went did a complete one into on this and he said that he really doesn't like email. Jackster are way better deal with and the interest meetings are are much better even zoom meetings or whatever you know they're still better than email anything's better than email actually. And again I think there's a good matter point here which is that people's productivity habits and lifestyles and stuff can and do change over time. This biography was written in like 2015 2016 and we're with five years in so it's probably kind of out of date on the stuff that Elon Musk is currently doing it's pretty good for his kind of past story. But I often I often think about this when people message me on Instagram or whatever asking hey what app are you currently are you using for x or what actually are used for y. And when it comes to like apps like to do list or not taking and stuff my personal app choices often vary. These days I'm using apple notes and I'm using but like this time last year I was using things that I was using ever note I was using a notion I was using room or whatever people's habits change over time and certainly the way that Elon approaches email has radically changed over time and so if someone read one of his articles back in the day it was like oh my god email and decided because Elon does it to switch their entire lives to running on email then they'd probably feel a bit snake to when Elon suddenly does a 180 on this. He's not trying to be a role model for everyone else to follow into follow his productivity habits he probably just doesn't even care and for him it was just a bit of a throwaway comment to mention at one point a few years ago that he likes email and to mention at one point this year that he doesn't really like email and so the method point here is we don't want to be overly wedded to following the advice of someone word for word and instead think about the principles think about the reason as to why they made that choice and then decide to build our own habits based around that maybe using that thing as inspiration rather than as a kind of set of instructions step by step. All right so listen seven relates to the idea of setting stretch goals i.e trying to do stuff in a way that is more ambitious than the traditional wisdom about this. Now in the book there's a nice quote from a former space executive who talks about how demanding Elon was when it came to setting goals because they were trying to build a car that could go from LA to New York in one gas in one tank of field. The team will work on the car for a year and test all of its parts then when they set off for New York after that year all of the vice presidents think privately the car will be lucky to get to Las Vegas what ends up happening is that the car gets to New Mexico twice as far as they ever expected and Elon is still mad so basically the vibe here and the vibe in this whole book is that Elon has these ridiculous goals that he sells for himself and for his team people people do say he can be very demanding can be a bit of a dick when it comes to sort of forcing people to follow those and has a very short fuse and will fire people if he thinks they're not being slim if they're not being fast enough. Maybe that's changed in the last five six years since the book was written i don't know i don't know the guy personally although Elon if you're watching this would love to interview you on the channel sometime and when it came to something like Tesla initially the Tesla roadster was supposed to come out in 2006 which was a ridiculously ambitious deadline ended up coming out in 2008 so like two years late but that was still faster than other competitors would have done it then other people would have done it because they would have taken a much longer time to actually get this thing off the ground and so for me the lesson here is that there is some value in setting stretch goals and one thing i often try to encourage the team is that like we don't want to take too long with doing stuff because then it when it comes to planning and planning and planning you're like you can plan all you want but ultimately execution when the rubber meets the proverbial road that's when real stuff tends to happen and so for example when we were initially planning our first cohort of a part time youtuber academy might online course you know if if if we've done it more sensibly it would have taken about six months to plan in reality it took about two weeks to plan and then we just put the course out there to see what happens and this is sort of a scrappy startup kind of vibe of making something and then iterating on it over time rather than spending ages planning to try and get the perfect product out and that certainly seems to be the way that Elon's approaching building stuff a Tesla and SpaceX and his other companies so overall i'm not personally a massive advocate of like lots and lots of goal setting and setting these sort of arbitrary deadlines and stuff but clearly it seems to work for Elon Musk and my ambition is a lot less than his so maybe there's something they're going on all right so final lesson from Elon is to focus on only the important things now here is a segment from one of his commencement speeches at say focus on on signal over noise a lot of companies get confused that they spend money on things that don't actually make the product better for example at a Tesla we've never spent any money on advertising we've put all of the money into R&D and manufacturing and design just try to make the car as good as possible basically what he's saying is we want to focus on the signal over the noise we want to focus on the important 20% of activities that are driving 80% of the results and this is just a really important lesson to always remind ourselves of that like are we doing the things actually driving results or are we doing what feels to us that are like work and what looks like work to other people but that's not actually driving the thing that we actually want to get out of it especially if we're not having fun along the way and one thing that I'm exploring a lot in the book that I'm working on is the idea that when we see work as having to be a hard thing and we see work as having to be suffering and we kind of imagine that things need to be harder than they actually are and so we end up kind of spinning our wheels quite a lot doing what we think looks like work but if we stop and think about it and think okay what's actually important here what are we working on you know just taking that time to take one step back is often really helpful and I find that for me whenever I actively take the time to do it I think huh there's probably an easier way to do this there's probably something more important I could be focusing on rather than this thing that I'm spending a lot of time doing so those were a bunch of life lessons from Elon Musk if you enjoyed this video and you care about things like productivity and time management which is on my favorite topics then check out this video over here which is sort of 10 tips on how I personally manage my time and a bunch of that basically a bunch of tips that I've learned from productivity books and people over the last like 10 years of my life all condensed into this one quick video so click over there to check that out thank you so much for watching do hit the subscribe button if you're already and I'll see you in the next video bye bye
