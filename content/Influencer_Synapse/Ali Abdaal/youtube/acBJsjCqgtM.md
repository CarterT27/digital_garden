## Transcript
 Making websites one of these things that feels really hard if you haven't done it before you're like Oh my god I need to code and need to do this and that HTML CSS JavaScript too It's it's so easy these days. Hey friends welcome back to the channel in this video We're talking about one of my favorite topics of all time which is how to create a website now I've been making websites since about the age of 12 But five years ago when I started my own personal website That was one of the best decisions I've ever made in my life and starting that personal website in 2016 Ultimately led to this YouTube channel where you are now watching this video and so in this video I'm gonna break down everything you need to know to create your own website We'll start by talking about why you should have a personal website Why it's something I recommend for everyone? Second link we'll talk about how to actually create your own personal website Have it get a domain in which platforms to use both free and paid options and then we'll talk about Once you've got a personal website, what the hell do you actually do with it? How can you make it work for you in a nice way so let's dive into it Let's start by talking about why you should have a personal website You know everyone has Twitter and Instagram and it's like why do why do we need a personal website? Well, overall there are six benefits of having a personal website and instead of using myself as an example Because I'm quite far ahead of the journey. I'm gonna use my housemate Sheen Who started her own personal website just under a year ago and has had all of these benefits in one form or another Benefit one of having a personal website is that it really helps you develop your own ideas So with Sheen for example, she cares a lot about women empowerment and Enjoy his documenting life as a PhD student and through writing her weekly blog posts She's just automatically become a better writer and a better communicator and she's better at developing her ideas overall Now this can seem quite sort of a Soft kind of benefit like the personal development side if you're not if you're not like naturally into that thing So benefit number two of writing online is that it actually really helps you in terms of your professional life as well In Sheen's example, she started her website in June of 2020 and has been blogging more or less every week and last year when she was applying to lots of jobs There were quite a few interviews that she had where the people on the interview panel had come across her website They googled her name and they'd found her blog and it in a way the website acted as a sort of online CV and in some of her interviews They would ask about things that she'd written on her blog and saying oh you wrote an article about this thing I'm interested in that thing myself. Let's talk about it. And these days whatever professional field you're in You can pretty much guarantee that your perspective employer is gonna be googling you and if you have your own website You have this, you know, you can put your best foot forward and you can start creating all these possibilities For someone to be like oh my god you're interested in this thing as well I'm interested in it too. Let's have a chat about it Benefit three of having a website that you write on regularly or a blog is that it gives you lots of connections So again, I've you know for me is it an example I've made friends from all around the world through my website through my youtube channel But I'm I'm quite far ahead of the process with Sheen again started less than a year ago She's had people from all around the world reach out to her because they read something interesting on her website and said oh You know you're interested in period poverty and things like that. I'm working on period poverty Let's get in touch. Let's have a bit of a chat about it. Oh, you're interested in improving access to women's education This is actually a charity that I'm working for that does the same thing. Let's talk about it And through that she's made a lot of interesting connections from all around the world Some of these connections have led to benefit number four which is that when you have a personal website You expose yourself to lots of in a you know in a non-weird way you expose yourself to lots of interesting opportunities And because random people around the world have found Sheen's blog posts through her website She's been invited to write articles for publications. She's been featured in lots of publications She's been invited on podcast and interviews and she's been invited as a speaker and all sorts of these And of global health Event type things which is exactly the sort of causes that she cares about which leads us on to benefit number five That when you have a personal website and you write on it regularly You can have a lot more impact than you would if you're not on the internet having a presence on the internet is the modern-day equivalent of Just being very good at networking and the analogy that I like is that it's like back in the day You imagine like if you just lived in a single village and you never interacted with anyone outside your village The amount of impact you can have the amount of opportunities you can have is pretty small because it's confined to your little village But if you're the sort of person back in the day who would every weekend? You'd visit a different village. They bring village and you'd be traveling around and you'd be making friends and saying hello to people and having conversations That sort of person just Automatically exposes themselves to a lot more interesting opportunities and can also have a far bigger impact on the world And if you're one of those people who insists on not having an online presence in Some capacity not having like your best but forward not having a professional reputation that's on the internet That's sort of the modern-day equivalent of just being confined to your little village where the only people that you're really going to interact with are people that you meet at work or at You know school university and maybe if you go to a conference or a networking event Maybe you'll run into someone but having that website that you write on regularly massively expands the potential impact of your work You know sheans had articles that she's written about women empowerment that have been shared like hundreds of times It would be almost impossible to have that level of impact Even I don't like that early stage without using the internet in some capacity You call if you want to take things further and your blog becomes particularly popular or you graduate to if you're having a YouTube channel Again, you know this video could potentially be seen by tens of not hundreds of thousands of people or all around the world That's far more impact than I'll ever have sitting in my little village and interacting with people one-on-one And finally benefit number six of having a personal website is that you can monetize it if you want Probably shouldn't be the main reason for having a personal website because generally You know, it takes a solid few years of doing the sort of stuff regularly before you actually make money from it But it's definitely a possibility and I've got lots of blogger and YouTube friends again different places around the world who are making Six to seven figures a year You know like hundred thousand to a million dollars plus per year from their websites Which is just utterly insane, but it's a sort of thing that happens if you stick with this for a very long time and overall Really the value of it personal website that you write on regularly is that it acts as a serendipity vehicle as my friend David Peralist call it It's like, you know Even while you're sleeping your work is out there on the internet and your thoughts and your blog posts or whatever it is that you're writing about is Out there and being shared by people if they think it's good and it's like having this little Army of robotic workers who's like working for you and like spreading your message far and wide And that has all these benefits that we've just talked about so let's say you're sold on why you should start a website I think every single person watching this should start a personal website straight off to you watch this video Question number two is well, how do you actually create a website now? This is actually a lot more straightforward than people make it out to be there's basically just two things that you need to create a website Number one you need a platform and number two you need a domain Let's start by talking about the platform and the platform is the thing that hosts your website So for example, you might have heard of Squarespace or WordPress or you might have seen an ad for wix.com We might have heard of the thing that I use called ghost. There's basically hundreds of website platforms out there Some of them are free most of them are paid and they'll let you create a website in some capacity And because I value your time, I'm gonna give you a list of three options to choose from that I would personally recommend Number one is a totally free option and that is sub-stack Now sub-stack is a great place to write a kind of email newsletter type thing It's not quite the same thing as a website like if I were to start a website on sub-stack I would create an account and then I would have my website being a leobdol dot sub-stack.com But it's quite nice because it's totally free. It's very easy to get started It automatically has the email newsletter component built in and so even if you have Even if you're starting from scratch, and you just have your friends and family signing up to your newsletter You can probably get like 10 subscribers to begin with and then every week when you write something It automatically sends it out to those 10 people and you've got that little URL like alibdol dot sub-stack dot com forward slash my blog post Which you can then share on Twitter or Instagram or LinkedIn or Facebook or whatever And then you can drive more traffic to your thing over time more and more people subscribe to a newsletter if they like this kind of stuff that you're writing And it's just a very free very easily accessible way of starting a website The problem with sub-stack though is that it's not really a website. It's more news literature You don't really have your own domain and if you want to take this website things seriously I would highly highly recommend paying for a service now Broadly when I speak to people about websites and there's an issue about paying for something There are two categories of people one category is like I was when I was 13 i.e Pakistani boy my mum controls my spending I don't have a credit card I can't spend any money online with that my mum's been per permission Or I physically don't have the money like for me. It was all of the above when I was younger You know that's the category of I literally cannot pay for anything Therefore, I need a free option and I used to spend years searching for free options to start a website back when I was like 13-14 years old If you're in that position, don't worry about it. We've all been there. I know how you feel I know how Asian parents are like and therefore you should just make an account on sub-stack and don't tell your parents about it These days though the second category of people other people that I talk to most are E people who can quite easily afford to pay for web hosting But choose not to do it because of some Absolutely ridiculous notion that everything on the internet should be free these are the people who are like you know Spend you know freaking $30 20 quid on a night out buying alcohol or like you know getting takeaways at least once a week People where they reasonable amount of disposable income Who still feel that oh my god paying 21 pennies Permanent for an app on my iPhone that I use every day. That's like a bad investment if you're in that category of person Please take my word for it feel free to start on sub-stack if you want to be if you want to kind of do this free But ideally don't be a cheap skate if you can afford it if you have the disposable income to start a website This is this is genuinely the sort of investment that can change your life and the good news is the kind of options that you have for this are not that expensive So there are two options that I would recommend on the paid route number one if you're a total computer Noob and you don't really know much about computers and you're not very comfortable with navigating computers and stuff Like my housemate sheen you should just use square space know the not sponsoring this video They sponsored a video of mine like two years ago. You should just use square space square space is easy It's 13 dollars a month and for that price You get all of the things that you need and if you pay for a year up front Which would kind of good because it forces you to take the website things seriously you also get a free dot com domain name Which you can just use but if you know a little bit about computers the option that I would personally Recommend is called ghost ghost is a nine dollar a month really really good web hosting solution It's what I've been using for my own website since 2016 for the last five years I absolutely love it my website today is still hosted on ghost and I'm like mates with the founder of ghost He's a cool guy's done an interview on this YouTube channel. They're a really great company They're entirely remote. It's open source software and if you pay for ghost pro Which is the hosting service that's just nine dollars a month and it's very very easy to get I have a cheeky affiliate link in the video description goes to all four slash alley I get a bit of a kickback if you sign up for that but feel free to not use my affiliate link I couldn't really care less I don't need the extra pennies from that affiliate link if we're being honest I just think you should use ghost because it's absolutely amazing and I just love it overall Which have a platform you use and I've given you three options sub stack square space and ghost They're all pretty good whatever option you choose don't overthink it one of the biggest mistakes You can make when it comes to creating a website is thinking that the platform matters like oh my god Wood press or webflow or wigs or square squares or ghost or like a hundred different solutions Spending ages certain like researching this it really does not matter like no one cares what platform your website is hosted on That the important thing is a that you have a website in the first place and b that you write decent content for it every week That gives you 99.9% of the value in the website The final 0.1% comes from choosing the right platform and SEO Optimization all these other fancy features that really no one actually cares about so overall don't everything the platform I'd recommend ghost personally, but feel free to use square space for which is slightly more expensive But slightly very slightly easier to use or feel free to use sub stack if you need a free option Secondly, what you might want is a domain now the domain is like early of the odd dot com or like a google dot com or like facebook dot com And that links to your website platform So initially when you make an account on ghost You might start with early of the odd dot ghost.io that would be your URL That's not very pretty. It's not very nice saying to someone hey check out my website at alib the odd dot ghost.io It's just it's just a bit amateur. That's probably why sub stack looks a bit amateur It's it's not very pro to be like hey check out my website alib the odd dot sub stack dot com What you can do is you can buy a domain like alib the odd dot com and That costs around about $10 per year This is very cheap this is less than $1 a month It is less than the price of coffee It's it's like buying a coffee every four months from like Starbucks that's how much it costs to get a domain name like $10 a yearish and then you link up that domain to square space or ghost Not really sub stack you have to pay extra $50 for that but ignore that but you link up that domain to square space or ghost And now you can see check out my website alib the odd dot com and that just sounds kind of cool If you're down for paying for a dot com or dot.io or dot code at UK or dot whatever domain name The service I use these days is google domains. It's easy to use very nice if you want a domain for free Then you're out of luck because you can't get a domain for free unless you're a student And if you're a student you can use a name cheap to get a dot a free dot m e domain and Dot me domains They're not as pro looking as dot com's but for a personal blog It's actually very reasonable to have a dot m e domain So if you're a student head over to name cheap I've been using them for the last 10 years for my domain hosting and I've only recently switched to google domains again It doesn't really matter what domain register are you use the two that I recommend on name cheap and google domains And then when you're done you've got your platform i e ghost or square space in which case you'll have aliebsald or square space dot com or aliebsald or ghost.io And then you have your domain which you connect to your thing and now you have a website and it's taken maybe Five or ten minutes to set up. This is all very nice and straightforward and again to use the example of my housemate You know this time last year when she decided she was gonna start a website She asked me Ali what platform should I use how do I do it? I said her I said go to square space dot com and you'll figure it out and she said that she really hated me for doing that because it I felt like I was throwing her in the deep end But it's like you know the whole point of these website solutions is that it's very easy to get started You can literally go on square space dot com click the buttons and it's just really really obvious how to make a website Making a website is one of those things that feels really hard if you haven't done it before You're like oh my god, I need to code and you need to do this and that HTML CSS JavaScript It's it's so easy these days back in the day in like 2005 when I was making my first websites Yes, it was hard. It's now 2021. It's like piss easy to make a website You literally just go on square space or ghost click the sign-up button enter your email and password and you're literally done It's so so easy if you haven't tried it yet 100% recommend you're giving it a go put caveat before we move on. Yes, I get that there are other free ways to do a website You could use an app and then netlify you could use heroku You could open source ghost web price check him up like all of that sort of stuff if you know what I'm talking about there Then you know that this suitable the this video which is for beginners is not for you If you're also this sort of person like it's hung up on whether you want to use netlify or heroku or ghost This and that chances are you're not the sort of person who actually writes anything once a week on a website So I would suggest at least from most people I've spoken to a horror in that camp of being computer nerds who are focused on how can I maximize my ability to create a website for free? Those are the people who focusing on the wrong things focus on creating content every week and publishing it and making it good Rather than quibbling about where this uses netlify or heroku for whenever website you're hosting finally Let's talk about now that you have a website because you've seen how easy it is to make a website What the hell do you do with your website how do you actually make your website good? Again, this is a lot more straightforward than people make it out to be Firstly your website only needs three pages. It needs an about page and needs a contact page and it needs a blog page Literally that is all you need your home page can literally just be your about page or it can be your latest blog post It doesn't matter and then once you've got those set up which again only takes about 20 minutes You don't need to overthink your about page or your contact page the real objective at this point now is to write a blog post and Try and do it every week once a week is I think a good cadence it gets you into the habit of writing It gets you into the habit of publishing it gets you into the habit of showing your work on the internet at this point People usually ask well, what do I write about and the answer to that is you can basically write about whatever you want The only bar I have for like what I'm gonna write about is could this potentially be useful to at least one other person in the world If I'm writing about my bowel habits that's probably not particularly useful to anyone in the world Therefore, I tend not to write blog posts about my bowel habits, but let's say I've read a book and I'm like Huh, this was a pretty good book. I learned a few things from it. I would write a blog post about the insights I learned from this book Let's I listen to a podcast and I was like, oh, you know I listened to this episode of the Tim Ferriss show that actually really good with self-golden You know there were these three things that stuck in my mind right up as a blog post That's the sort of thing that would be useful to at least one other person Let's say I'm going through university and I'm I don't know a first-year medical student It would be very reasonable for me to write what the experience of a first-year medical student is like Would that be useful to anyone else? Yeah, probably it would be useful to people who are thinking of going into medical I'd say you're like she and are you doing a PhD? Would it be useful for you to write about your experiences of doing a PhD? Yes, it would because potentially other people who might want to do that would be interested in What is the day-to-day experience of doing a PhD actually like? And there's a nice quote from Gary Vaynerchuk that I often come back to which is document don't create like creating Content and the concept of that is actually really hard It feels like a big deal But if you just think about documenting the stuff that you're doing anyway it becomes very easy to find ideas of things to write about Like if I were starting a blog from scratch and I had zero audience nothing at all I would just document the way that I'm living my life. I'd be like you know This is my morning routine and this is why this is my morning routine here is an article that I read about Exyn this is what made what it made me think about here is a book that I read about why and here is a quick summary of the book And a link to the book with an Amazon link that's the sort of stuff I'd be writing about and I'd be exploring any other kind of topics that I personally enjoyed So she in for example is super into women empowerment and a eradicating period poverty and improving access to girls education That's cool. She writes articles about that. I'm more into like tech and like content creation and like personal development and like you know How can we improve our careers in my social skills and so I'd be writing about those sorts of topics that I care about But the main thing is that once you set a goal of right publishing something once a week Especially if you haven't like an email newsletter associated with it you just end up finding things to write about like there are Zillions of ideas out there you just need to pick one of them right about it publish it and just do this every week for the next two years And I can pretty much guarantee that your life will change in an interesting way and after the question of what do I write about the next question people always ask is Well, how will my stuff be seen? Let's say I write you know, let's say I had no audience Let's say I wrote a blog post about I don't know why I have a fake plant on my desk I can talk about how I read a book by Richard Wiseman called 59 seconds and he talked about how having greenery on your desk Sort of encourages creativity. I could write a blog post about that and I'd publish it on my blog But literally no one would ever find that thing but the solution these days is very simple when you write a blog post Share it on Twitter or Instagram or LinkedIn or Facebook or wherever you have social media Everyone has social media in some capacity and if you don't you're doing it wrong You should have an account on Twitter because Twitter is amazing for professional networking and all that kind of stuff You should also probably do LinkedIn if you're into the whole professional Side of things because LinkedIn is great, but once you write a blog post you can literally just post a link to it on Facebook Post a link to it on Twitter or post a link on Instagram post a link to LinkedIn post a screenshot on Instagram That's how sheen without an audience at the start got to the point where her blog was starting to get readers She just posted about it on Instagram. She had a few hundred followers on Instagram at the time Just friends and family and through that people found the blog and then every time she would write any blog post She would post about it on Instagram and on LinkedIn and then on LinkedIn You've got this sort of professional audience that cares about this sort of stuff Instagram is more like her people Carrying about her life because they have family and friends and then through those those like you know 10 or 20 people here and they're reading an article one of those people within share it with someone else and saying Hey, this is interesting. Why don't you read this person's article? It's already the way that people find your blog find their find your website is not really through search engine optimization these days Maybe used to be in like 2005, but it's now 2021 Usually for most personal websites the way people find your stuff is because you've shared it on Social media on your own to your own friends and family and then someone there who's resonated with your thing has shared it a little bit wider And yeah, at the start no one's going to read your stuff because it's probably not very good If you haven't had an experience of writing you're probably writing some pretty crap stuff But that's okay. Like this is the sort of thing that improves over time and certainly at the start when I started my YouTube channel and my blog No one was reading a known was watching I would get like 23 video views on a YouTube video and at the time It's because my YouTube videos weren't very good But over time as I made more of them I got better at making YouTube videos I got better at writing blog posts and I therefore built this audience over time So if you're worried about no one's going to read my stuff don't worry about it because it takes time But also make sure you're sharing it on social media because that's just a very easy way for people to find Whatever you're writing on your website And there's a few other frequently asked questions that I often get when it comes to the website thing number one people always ask How do I make my website look pretty and I would say don't worry about it? The the design does not matter if you use ghost if you use square space It's going to be pretty by default and these days when it comes to a personal website the aesthetics of the website is Absolutely not the thing people care about people care about the content they care about the ideas they care about the writing It's really all about the writing and as long as your design does not get in the way of the writing You don't need to worry about the design you can just pick a default theme Square space their free ghost has a lot of free templates for the first four years my website It was just using a free ghost theme the default one and it looked pretty good I'd get messages from people being like oh my god your website is so pretty. How did you design it? I just feel like look it's just the default free theme that just comes with ghost when you use ghost as your website platform These days I use a custom design themed But I've been doing the website thing and the content thing for five years at this point So do not worry about design at all focus on the content secondly people often ask about SEO Which stands for search engine optimization again completely ignore it do not worry about search engine optimization It is very unlikely that your personal website will be getting any reasonable traffic from search engine optimization Instead focus on writing good stuff and sharing it on Twitter or whatever social media you have and if it resonates with people The kind of organic sharingness of your articles is what lead to more website traffic Compared to you worrying about SEO don't worry about SEO. It's a sort of thing You can worry about three years further down the line people sometimes ask how do I monetize my website again? Don't worry about it for the first two years my theorem This is that unless you've been writing weekly for at least one to two years You don't need to worry about monetization in this lightest and finally people often ask But like what if I'm scared to put myself out there? Like, you know, I don't want to use my real name online or like it feels really scary to like put myself out there and have a personal website Trust me. I've been there in 2016. I had all of these fears myself I've been wanting to set up a website for like years at that point and I never did it because I was just too scared But I found the solution and that is all in this video over here Which talks about how writing online made me a millionaire and in that video I share how I got over the fear of putting myself out there on the internet and how ultimately my personal website ended up completely changing my life So check that video out over there. Thank you so much for watching. I hope you found this video useful and I'll see you in the next one. Bye
