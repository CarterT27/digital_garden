## Transcript
 Hi there, I'm Corinne and I'm New Steel and we're Cambridge Medics who are six mid-instructors for the UK cat crash course. And we thought we'd make this video and tell you about the course and share our experiences of the UK cat. So as you might know, the UK cat is a really weird example with really tight timing. You can't really revise for it, but there are so many tips and techniques that we can take you to to help you make sense of sections like the abstract reasoning and situation adjustment. The course itself and cells run due in September, all across the country. Each course has two instructors that are medical students like us and you scored highly on the UK cat when we took that cells not so long ago. We spend around an hour and a half on each of the four sections, covering the main strategies and techniques. We get through lots of timed practice questions and make sure that nobody is left behind or moving on. We pack our hell of a lot into one day, but practicing questions in your own time is also really important in doing one of the UK cat. To help with that, all students get access to UK cat ninja, which is our online question. Yeah, you get two free mock exams that you can do at the computer and 50% off a UK cat ninja subscription which gives you access to hundreds of questions online. All our students also get unlimited support from our lovely team of medical students. So if you're stuck with questions or techniques, we're always happy to help by email or by phone. We're also pretty good at giving personal statement and interview advice. So you can always go and click through this if you need to hand with those. That's pretty much all of those to say. We've been running our courses for three years now with over 3,000 students and wonderful reviews. You can read some of our reviews on our website. UK catcrashcourse.com. There, you'll find loads of more information about course and also about our unlimited personal skills which has brought students in financial difficulties. And here at 6th May, we also on crash courses for being able to introduce if you fancy taking a look at this. If you have any questions about anything, our contact details are on the website and we'd love to have a chat. So thanks for watching, we hope to see you soon. Bye. Bye.
