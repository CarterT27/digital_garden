## Transcript
 Hey guys, welcome back to the channel. If you're new here, my name is Ali, I'm a junior doctor working in Cambridge and today we're going to be talking about this whole desk setup situation here that I'm going to be using for YouTube being studying general productivity stuff. So I'm going to be talking about how I've put it all together, the rationale behind choosing the various things and I'll link in the description below to all of the various products along with timestamps. So if you are just interested in the tree or the lamp or whatever, then you can just kind of skip ahead in the description. You don't have to watch the whole video but it will be really nice if you did. So let's just jump into it and we'll start with the desk. Now the desk is the IKEA Elvarelli wooden countertop that is propped up on two random metal legs from IKEA but on the other side we've got the Alex draw unit. The Elvarelli countertop means that you can pretty much get a desk as long as you want. They've got these in different sizes. You can cut them down to size, having the Alex draw unit on one side or on both sides like some people have means you've got loads of loads of space and it also looks really nice. It looks like you've got this like custom built desk. So that was the desk. Let's now talk about the chair and this is a random ergonomic office chair that belongs to my housemate. I really wanted to get the hooking mirror and body because it looks absolutely sick. But when I mentioned the price tag to my mom, she completely vetoed the idea of me spending a thousand pounds on a chair. Even though I, you know, I argued that it was my own money and that it was good for the back and all of this sort of stuff but she just was not having it at all. All right now let's talk about the tech and the laptop that's powering this whole setup is the new 2018 15-inch MacBook Pro with the touch bar. It's got the i9 processor, the 32GB of RAM and I went for the one terabyte hard drive upgrade. That MacBook is connected via the Satashi USB aluminium hub thing to this LG 34-inch ultra wide monitor. This is a pretty budget ultra wide monitor as far as they go. I think it was in the region of about 300 pounds. They can go up to over a thousand pounds, especially if you want a 4K display or a 5K display or a 38 inch ultra wide. I went for this one. I've been using it for the last almost three years now and I've not actually noticed anything wrong with it and my theory about upgrading stuff is that it's only really worth upgrading something. If what you currently have feels like it sucks or like you feel a genuine pain when you when you use it and there's a lot of research that shows that actually if you want to increase your happiness by spending money then the only way to do that really is by removing salient negatives rather than by adding additional positives and you'll notice that the old pipe thing is covering up the power cable and the HDMI cable and I think it looks quite cool. You can't really see it from a distance and if you do it it sort of looks like it's kind of the monitor is floating in mid air. Right, let's talk about peripherals now and for my trackpad I'm using the Apple Magic Trackpad and on the other side I've got the Logitech MX Master, this is the standard TechYouTuber mouse and I actually like combining the mouse with the trackpad. I use the trackpad for like scrolling things because it's got really nice smooth scrolling on it but also if I'm editing in final cut I use the trackpad to swipe through the timeline. So I feel kind of cool. I've got my little command center leading back on my chair, I've got the mouse and one hand the trackpad and the other edge just feels it feels like a nice experienced edit videos and for the keyboard I'm using the original Apple Wireless Bluetooth keyboard thing which I bought in like 2009 from a friend of mine and I've literally been using it these last nine years. I'm not looking back. It's absolutely incredible. On the desk I also like to have my old 2015 Retina MacBook Pro. This thing is still great. I take it to work these days because I'm not overly worried if something bad happens to it but it still works absolutely amazingly for pretty much anything I want to do on a computer other than hardcore video editing. That sounds weird. The speakers I'm using at the moment and have been for the last three years are these basic Logitech 25 pound ones I got. I'm a Ziddy, you've got a left, you've got a right and you've got the subwoofer underneath. I kind of do want to upgrade to like a decent 300 pound set of speakers. Lots of other tech youtubers use the Adam Artis speakers or like some audio technical ones. Those look really cool and like the glossy white looks really nice but again I see no reason to upgrade these. I'm not an audio file when it comes to my speakers and these are cheap and work very well and have never let me down. Right so in terms of lamps I've got two at the moment. One of them on that side is the classic angle poise lamp and then on this side we've got this new tomons and an AV&E sort of design Pixar lamp looking thing. Jonathan Morrison who's an incredible tech youtuber likes to use in his videos. As a moment I'm not 100% sure about the double lamp but I do quite like the warm glow that it gives to the whole room especially if I'm editing at night. It just makes me feel warm and fuzzy inside. I've also got these two Japanese cup things which I bought from Japan when I went there about six years ago now. I absolutely love these. I think it adds like a nice splash of personality to a desk. Underneath the desk I've got one of those headphone stand things that you just stick to the underside of the desk and on one side of those I've got my audio technical M50Xs which I use for audio editing when I'm doing music stuff and on the other side I put my stethoscope and like NHS Lanyard and like Bluetooth headphones that take to work. Let's now talk about the plants so I've got this fake IKEA potter plant. Again this is like it's pretty much required purchasing for anyone who wants to be a tech youtuber literally everyone has these. This is great. I just really like the splash of green air out to the desk and recently I decided to add a treat to the desk setup. This is the Pachiro treat which is like an indoor treat that's apparently quite easy to look after. So if you're interested in adding a little bit of flair to your desk setup or to your house in general you might want to consider some indoor plants. I think this has become almost the centerpiece of the whole room because it's just so nice like sitting on the sofa, having a cup of coffee, listening to a fantasy audio book on audible ink below and just kind of seeing a treat in front of you. There's just nothing that beats that experience. And finally I always like to have a deck of cards somewhere on my desk. So I've been practicing close-up magic now for about eight years. Wow that's a long time. So if I'm ever kind of doing something that doesn't require these my hands are I like to just kind of grab the deck and do some moves with it. Oh yeah and I forgot to mention in terms of cable management. Again from IKEA I've got one of those like cable rack things that you just drill into the underside of the desk and that stores all the cables and then for the most part when you wherever you're on the room you can't really see any cables. I still think there's room for improvement but you know this does the job for now. All right thank you for watching that is everything on my desk. I hope you found this video interesting. Thank you very much for watching. If you like the video please give it a thumbs up. If you haven't subscribed to the channel please consider doing so. I've now started working as a doctor so I make blogs about what life as a doctor is like. But I'm also kind of making a few tech videos about kind of apps that I use productivity wise and what I've got in my iPad all of that sort of stuff. I'll put some more links in the description below so yeah thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next video. Goodbye.
