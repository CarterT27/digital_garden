## Transcript
 Hey friends, welcome back to another episode of my day in the life vlog. The day starts at 830 when I wake up and lie in bed for a few minutes, pondering the vagaries of human existence. I'm able to live with my own thoughts for too long, though. I retrieve my iPad air from the sleeve thing next to my bed and begin my morning journaling practice in the app day 1. After a few minutes of that, I make the mistake of checking Twitter and fall into the dopamine hit rabbit hole of checking my mentions and replies and aimlessly scrolling through my feed. At 915, I spontaneously decide to stop being a waste man and get out of bed to start the day with a burst of optimism. I can already sense that today's going to be the start of something new. I head into the bathroom, remove my invisible line braces, shout out to anglia orthodontics for hooking me up with those to fix my smile. I brush my teeth, clean the kitchen and figure out how to assemble this new chemics filter paper thing that doesn't quite fit my chemics cafeteria. Guess next time I'll just stick to the status quo. At 940, I sit down with my coffee and to channel my inner normie, I watch an episode of the Big Bang Theory. When that's over, I grab the mugs from the living room. Do some dishes, load up the dishwasher and wipe down the remnants of yesterday's Indian takeaway like the domestic goddess that I aspire to be. At 1005, I set up my desk and make a start on preparing this evening's live session for the part-time youtuber academy. We're in week one of the four week live course at the moment with 400 students and a thriving community. I spend a bit of time answering questions, students have posted on our forum and then get to finalizing the lesson plan. At 11 o'clock, I have a one hour session with my business coach Hassan. We met when I interviewed him for his book The Unfaired Vantage and now we've become mates and I'm his student in the business coaching program and he's my student in the part-time youtuber academy isn't that fun. At noon, we wrap up the call and because I feel smelly, I have a shower and change out of my pajamas, which for the rest of the day really helps me get my head in the game. I preen a bit in front of the camera and then the doorbell mysteriously rings and a very special parcel arrives. But before I can unbox it, I have to make sure my lesson is fully planned for the evening. From 1245, I make some more progress on my slides. And then, after half an hour, my lovely editor Christian reminds me that I need to shoot a thumbnail for my MacBook Pro review video that's coming out later today. I spend half an hour shooting various shots on the overhead rig while having a chat with someone who messaged me on Instagram, asking for advice about a business idea that they had. At 140, food arrives from Pretta, Monjay, my housemate, Sheen and I eat our falafel wraps and share a tuna melt toasty while watching an episode of shit's quick, which is our meal time TV show of choice these days. From 2pm onwards, I have a call with my team about more course related things. We're working on automatically tracking data for our students based on what the goals are for their youtube channels and how well they're getting on with doing the homework assignments. The idea is that we'd be able to actively reach out to students who seem to be falling behind to see if there's anything that we can do to help them out. After the call, I spend the next 90 minutes continuing to prepare more material for the evening's live session, which starts at 4pm and lasts for 2 hours. We have around 250 students joining us on the Zoom call and we go through the idea generation machine. A framework for never running out of content ideas. We talk through the strategies for eureka moments, the birdsong technique and the coal mining method of finding ideas with lots of interactive exercises along the way. This is super fun and straight off to saying goodbye to our students. I head into a Zoom catchup call with the team and our five peer supporters who've been running their own support sessions. At 720pm, that's all finished and so that's my official work done for the day. I spend the next 30 minutes unboxing and shooting thumbnails with my new PlayStation 5, which is going to be the death of my productivity and this is truly what I've been looking for. By 8pm, my house mate Sheen has cooked up a mean, somewhat healthy meal of grilled chicken, mashed potatoes and peas. She's just passed her PhD and so we celebrate by watching the bullywood film, Kabihushi Kabihum. The film is pretty good but it's a bit over the top and the songs are annoyingly long. Thankfully, I'm able to pass the time during the songs by working on an online course on Brilliant who are very kindly sponsoring this video. If you haven't heard by now, Brilliant is a great app with online courses on maths, science and computer science. I've been using Brilliant regularly for just over a year now and it taught me so much in an interactive and engaging fashion. I'm working on their funky new course about geometry and the nice thing about Brilliant is that they teach everything in a really nice, first principles fashion with lots of interactive examples and storytelling elements that make for a truly world-class learning experience. In fact, the courses on Brilliant often remind me of the small group tutorials that I used to have as a medical student at Cambridge University, which would be based around teaching a concept and then letting the student run with it and work on challenging problems and so we end up learning through experience rather than just directly. If you'd like to join me on this shared journey of improving our maths, science and computer science or even learning how to code with their excellent Python courses. Head over to Brilliant.org forward slash Ali and the first 200 people to hit that link will get 20% off the annual premium subscription. After finishing a few lessons on Brilliant, I intend to do something productive on my MacBook but I get caught up in the riveting story of the film and before I know it, it's 11pm and I've got tears in my eyes from the reunion between the two families and the sense that we're all in this together. Then, at 11pm, after breaking free from the chains of the sofa, I get rid of the PS4 and I set up the new PS5 with some pretty sick cable management, if I can say so myself. I download a few updates, start copying over Horizon Zero Dawn from its PS4 disc and I buy demon souls on the PlayStation Store to download. I spend the next two hours in a video game induced super, dying many many many times in demon souls, but having a great time all around. So overall, this has been a pretty solid day of being somewhat productive, preparing and teaching a two hour live session for the part-time youtuber academy and ending with a three hour body would film and two hour video gaming session. I hope you enjoyed this insight into my lockdown life. Here's a link to a recent video touring my whole apartment if you'd like to check that out. Thank you for watching and see you in the next video.
