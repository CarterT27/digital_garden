# Midnight Medical Emergency  - Cambridge University medical student VLOG #04
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxXwfMrWYPE
Part II of our wilderness medicine expedition with the Cambridge University Wilderness Medicine Society (CUWMS). We kick things off with a nighttime medical emergency at the campsite, followed by a quick debrief, and then an artsy montage of the final day of trekking around the beautiful Yorkshire Dales National Park.

The wilderness medicine trips will definitely be one aspect of Cambridge medical student life that I'll miss the most when it's over. These vlogs will hopefully be a way to relive the wonder one day when we're all jaded from the grind of doctor life.

Huge thanks again to everyone who went on the trip - you guys were awesome :)

Who am I:

I'm Ali, a final year medical student at Emmanuel College, Cambridge. This vlogging thing seems quite fun so I'll be vlogging life and other things throughout the year. I'm pretty into music and coding as well, so maybe there'll be some of that on this channel.

## Transcript
 Alright, it's about 11pm, we're all knackered, but we've got another scenario they just started. And we're all with us to assemble upstairs. Basically, there's been a fire of the campsite, they need help, so we're going to have two medics, one expo leader. So we've got Ali, you're one medic, no, you're another medic. Okay, if you need me, I'll be in the doorway, I have this building, okay? That's what I'll say, if not, I want Ricky to be my runner. Okay, we'll uncaptured, the more close guys, people. We've got someone. We've got someone. Fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire. There's fire down on it, I'm not sure to put it down on it. We're waiting nice deep breaths. Trust me, trust me, trust me, trust me, trust me, trust me. You're waiting here right now. Someone, yes, we need five people here, so we can let our take our inside. We do one more hour. One person is suffering from severe burns, one is having a wee, is having wezing in silence. Anyway, it was fine because she was screaming. Breathing was okay because she was still breathing. Circulation was a problem with pulse rate quite high, but then we had the burns injuries. So Ben was our drunk off the campsites, and he stumbled back and knocked him the barbecue into the tent. Of course, the fire. There was one patient Isabella who had burns on her right arm and right legs. There was another patient Becky who had like a smoke inhalation injury and her asthma started playing up. And ended up dying, and there was a third patient Ben who his head was drunk, got an epidural hemorrhage, and also ended up dying. So I think three out of three patients ended up dying, but it was really good fun. We did reasonably well. Tomorrow we're just going to do a small walk, and then we're going to head home. Good night. Good morning, everyone. It's the last day of the Royal Ennis medicine trip. We're about to go for a walk, and we're just trying to soak in the Yorkshire countryside where to go back to the flat Cambridge. Here we go. Tell them not to worry for me. All right, so that brings us to the end of another amazing wilderness medicine trip. Thank you for watching. We hope you enjoyed it. Please like and subscribe. We'll see you next time. Bye-bye. Wait, wait, wait.
