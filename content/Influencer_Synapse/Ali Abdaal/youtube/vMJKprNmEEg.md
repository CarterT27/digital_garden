https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMJKprNmEEg
In today's vlog, we visit Sandringham, the Queen's estate, and pick some apples in the orchard. We subsequently demolish those apples and turn them into apple crumble, which we munch on while studying in the evening. Enjoy xx

Who am I:

I'm Ali, a final year medical student at Emmanuel College, Cambridge. This vlogging thing seems quite fun so I'll be vlogging life and other things throughout the year. I'm pretty into music and coding as well, so maybe there'll be some of that on this channel.
