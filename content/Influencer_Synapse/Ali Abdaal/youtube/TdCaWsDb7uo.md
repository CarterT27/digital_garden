This episode is a 2-day highlight reel of the International Technology-Enabled Care Conference, a medical technology conference in Birmingham that I gave a short talk at. We explore Birmingham city centre in glorious slow-mo, have some free refreshments, play a bit of 'My Heart Will Go On' and reflect on how it feels to give a talk to an audience of 6. Enjoy xx

## Transcript
 Hey guys, welcome back to the channel. It's about 10 o'clock in the morning and I've just arrived in Birmingham Took a train from Cambridge this morning and I'm here for a two-day medical technology conference and tomorrow at 11 o'clock I'm gonna be giving a talk about how to build apps Using a medical app that I've helped work on as like a case study. This should be quite exciting. I've never really been to big one of these conferences I've been to a few I've been to a few in the past and honestly, I'm not sure how I feel about med tech conferences Generally just because a lot of it seems fairly hand-wavey and kind of people talking about how amazing med tech is but not actually doing anything in med tech But I hope this one will be different because it seems like the speaker line up is pretty good It seems like there are people who have made like awesome companies within med tech Hopefully giving practical advice and so I mean some insights about about what they've learnt Learned along the way and then yeah my talk is gonna be fairly basic Fairly kind of aimed at a broad audience about how to build apps Because I think that's something that lives people are into but a lot of people don't really know how to do But yeah, it's chilling in Birmingham city center at the moment trying to find this international convention center Let's have a look around All right, so we've just had the morning session where they were chatting Perhaps unsurprisingly about technology enabled care and there were a few like keynotes because including like a Telly conference type talk from one of the ministers from Scotland Who's in the Scottish government that was quite interesting now. We've got this half an hour break But we're all just kind of roaming around watching these exhibition stands having free refreshments Well, they weren't free. I think tickets to this conference are about five hundred quid But I'm actually getting from free, which is a quite cheeky and quite exciting I think at some point today, I want to make it my mission to visit all of the exhibitors and see kind of what Technology solutions they're providing to healthcare But I get the impression that a lot of it is kind of focused at selling to businesses rather than selling to consumers So I'm not sure how relevant it will be I meant these two very interesting people over lunch one of them was a lady who's from Nigeria And in the UK doing her MBA, which is just finished and her plan is to go back to Nigeria and set up Like a service for care of the elderly which apparently something is quite lacking in Nigeria at the moment The only things there are like private solutions Which are make expensive But what she was doing is that she wants to use some some kind of technology thing To improve care of the elderly Among that last year with dementia and she said that the care that she received in the Health care system there wasn't really up to scratch so she had just still want to do better So she came to the UK to do an MBA and it's like I'm going back to Nigeria and she was quite inspiring really Now with the afternoon talks See my little bit dead to be honest They're all kind of aimed at industry experts and and people who are actually kind of buying Healthcare solutions for their companies and for their patients So I'm just going to sit in the local Starbucks this is the Starbucks in the convention center actually and it's quite nice And I'm just going to sit here and work Because we've got finals coming up and I should probably do a little bit of work for the situational judgment test But yeah, it's been a pretty great day so far my good back in for a few talks later I'm going to hang out with my cousins this evening All right, we're back for day two of the conference We've got a few talks in the morning in the main room and then I'm going to be giving my talk in about two hours time Everybody I'm going to introduce now Ali Abdel he's going to give us a presentation now on how anyone can make an app Which I know I'm pretty interested in so I'm going to be watching in 10 weeks. So thank you Cheers My name is Ali I'm a finally a medical student at Cambridge University and I also like to make apps and websites on the side And this is going to be a talk kind of anger people who I was sort of fairly familiar with computers But perhaps have never really coded the root thing. It might be interested in the idea of maybe making the own app one day So yeah, thank you very much All right guys, so that's the talk finished If I'm honest it was a little bit pointless because there were only like five or six people in the audience it clashed With one of the main one of the main talks in the main theater But I suppose that's the case with these sorts of things when when you're given these opportunities to do stuff I find that it's good to just kind of say yes to them because you never really know whether it's going to be useful or not This objectively wasn't very useful, but you know I still managed to come to Birmingham visited some family Took two days off placement and got to make a vlog out of it even if nothing else came from it Although like even then they were like five or six people in the audience a few of them were taking Abbott notes when I was talking about how to build apps So yeah, maybe it's made a difference probably not but hey, it was fun anyway I think now I'm gonna get the free lunch and then head back to Cambridge All right finished with the conference for today heading towards Birmingham station to take the train back to Cambridge now I had some cool guys of a lunch one of them Bronze this tech company which makes a platform for messaging patients and they're apparently Exchange 20 million messages through the platform every month that was cool and those is other guy who's launched at least like 20 different Medical products and was talking about how it's pretty much seconded to him by now and he was going with some tips about this whole product development thing So all in all lunch was good once was tasty for the train back to Cambridge and back to reality All right friends back in Cambridge conference is over that was quite good. I'm glad I did it my talk as as you know Only like four people watched it, but hey, it was fine. It was a good conference had a good time I spent the night with my cousins in Birmingham. It was really cool and I've now progressed on to the grade two Site-winning book Which is very exciting and I'm now gonna do some practice tonight do some video editing and then drive back to placement Thank you very much for watching.
