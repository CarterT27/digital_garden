# My 2018 university Desk Setup - Cambridge medical student
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdew7At9S2U
As promised, here's the long-awaited video about my 2018 university desk setup. I use it for work (I'm a medical student in case you haven't heard), video editing, web design and development (www.6med.co.uk), watching stuff on the internet and pretty much everything else. 

This is something I've wanted to do for a while, but doesn't neatly fit into the usual 'medicine application advice' or 'life of a medical student vlog' that the rest of my videos fall under.

## Transcript
 Hey guys, welcome back to the channel. If you're new here, my name is Ali, I'm a finally a medical student at Cambridge University and this is going to be video about this here desk setup that I've been using for the last year. I've never done one of these desk setup videos before but I've seen a lot of them on YouTube, I really enjoyed watching them and so I thought I'd give it a go and see what happens. So the whole setup is organized around this idea of the MacBook Pro in commercial mode where you've got the lid closed and you've got the power cable connected to it and an HDMI cable connecting it to a monitor and I think this is really really ideal for students and for anyone that needs to take their laptop and move around because when you want to go on the move all you have to do is unplug a few cables, pick it up and then take it with you and then when you get back home you put it back in the dock, plug a few cables in and then you sort it. The screen that I'm using is the LG 34-inch something, something something, having a 34-inch screen that's it's it's absolutely massive like when I first got it I was astounded as to how wide it was if I'm doing any kind of website stuff I can have one half of the screen devoted to the website and the other half of the screen, the text editor, a wide screen monitor is really good for video editing as well because you can see kind of the whole timeline and you just have kind of more space to deal with. Also if I'm making notes from a website for work I can have like Wikipedia article open one half of the screen and then my Microsoft One Note thing open on the other half of the screen. The ultra wide display is is a weird aspect ratio it's 21 to nine most wide screens are 16 to nine. If I'm trying to watch YouTube videos usually you get these annoying like black boxes on the side but every now and then you do see the old video I think some film trailers are now filmed in 21 nine. So if you're watching like a Star Wars trailer for example you can fully take advantage of all that screen real estate which is like super nice and it makes for a really nice almost cinematic video. So that's enough about the screen let's move on to the peripherals I'm using the Apple Bluetooth keyboard which I've been using literally since I think about 2009 that was when a friend of mine bought it and then he didn't want it anymore so I bought it off him for about 30 quid. He's a really nice and with this keyboard I can hit my like 150 minute typing speed which is how to do with other keyboard so I just love this one. On the left hand side of that I've got the Apple Magic Tract Pad and on the right hand side I've got the Logitech MX Master which is my favorite mouse and that's the mouse that loads and loads of YouTubers seem to have as well. The Magic Tract Pad is really nice to have especially when you have a MacBook because a lot of stuff is done on macOS with gestures so like you know the four fingers swipe or zooming or scrolling and I think scrolling with the Tract Pad is alone worth the price of the Tract Pad just because scrolling with a mouse it's a bit like the screen kind of doing that weird thing where it jumps. Whereas it's so smooth on the Tract Pad you're just going to move your finger and you feel as if you like one with the computer that's why I love the Tract Pad so much. Other things on the desk I've got these two little mug cup things that I bought from Japan when I went for a research project in second year. One of them is for spare coins and the other one is for pens and highlighters and scissors and stuff. I've also got one of these fake random plotted plant things. The only reason I bought this was because I spent a lot of my time watching these desk setup videos and it seems like every other tech YouTuber has one of these fake plants so I thought I'd get one it was I think about eight pounds on Amazon and I really like it. I think it adds a nice splash of color to the setup and there is a bit of evidence so it's like psychology because I was reading that says if you have green stuff around your office or your workplace that like boosts creativity so every subsequent desk setup that I ever have in future is going to feature some kind of fake plant. It should be just so nice to have. Final thing on the desk I usually have a deck of cards somewhere to hand. I've been doing like cartridge, close up magic key stuff for the last like six, seven years. It's really quite sad but anytime I'm watching something and I need something to do with my hands I just kind of grab this deck of cards and just a few things. This is how I don't most of my flat of hand just through kind of casually packaging while watching stuff on the internet. Oh yeah one more thing I forgot to mention I also have this prism like device and this is it's cool because when you put it in front of a camera it like changes the image and you can get some interesting effects with it and quite a lot of Instagram photographers use these sort of prism things to make nice portraits so I've been really playing around with that but I need to do more of it so that's why I have it on my desk just to kind of remind me and then off to the side of my desk I've got this one mini table thing that came with the room. This desk and the chair came with the room as well I have no idea what they are they're just like I only buy the university. This mini desk is where I have the laptop and on the bottom shelf of this I've got a books or a note pads that I need access to quickly and that's where I also keep the charges and stuff just to keep the generally clean semi-minimilistic look and on the other side of the desk I've got this like makeshift table that I've made with two cardboard boxes and that's where the rechargeable battery thing sits usually boxed issues and this angle poised lamp. This desk itself is just a bit too small for it which is why I had to make like a separate anix to hold whole the lamp but in future hopefully when when I'm working as a doctor and have my own place and have like a massive desk aiming for like a hundred centimeter long desk then you know the lamp can actually be on the side and look cool and at some point I'm going to upgrade to like Philips Hue smart light bulb change color all that stuff but that'll be the subject of another video probably when I move out of university and hopefully get my own place so I think that pretty much concludes this video I hope you enjoyed it never done this sort of desk sort of thing before if you liked it let me know the comments uh if you didn't again let me know the comments I'd like to get some constructive feedback about this sort of thing but yeah thank you very much for watching if you like the video please give it a thumbs up if you haven't subscribed yet please consider doing so have a lovely night and I'll see you in the next video. Bye bye
