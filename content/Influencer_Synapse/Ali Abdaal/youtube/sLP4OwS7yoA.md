## Transcript
 Hey guys, welcome back to the channel. If you're new here, my name is Ali and I'm a junior doctor working in Cambridge and this is Medical Mondays, the series where every Monday we talk about very very niche medical topics and today we are kicking off a mini series about preparing for the academic foundation program. So the academic foundation program is an alternative option to the normal foundation program which lasts for two years, your first two years after medical school and in the AFP as you might know, if you're watching this video, one of your six blocks in the foundation program becomes a research block. So it's kind of like an entry into the academic route. So in light of the fact that there's not much information about this, we're doing a mini series about it. So this is going to be broken up into four videos. In this video we're going to be talking about why you should apply to the AFP and a little bit of background about what it is. In the next video we're going to be talking about preparing for the interview specifically the clinical emergency station. Video number three is going to be about preparing for the interview specifically the critical appraisal station and the final video is going to be talking about how to prepare for the personal interview and giving you some recommendations of resources. This video is almost exclusively aimed at fifth and sixth year medical students in the UK. It is not going to be relevant to anyone else. So what's the format of this series? Um, basically a few months ago I sat down with a surgeon, his name is Mr. Ankru Kajuria and he is pretty pro at AFP because he runs a course for a had a prepare for the AFP and he's written a book about it. I read his book just before my London AFP interview. I thought it was really good. I ended up not getting any of my AFP choices. I got reserved listed for London and for EPH Essex Bedfordshire Hartfordshire. But, uh, because in this video I'm kind of talking to him and asking him for tips that I wish I would have known in hindsight. But now we're going to cut to meet and anchor from about six months ago where we're explaining what the point of the AFP is and why you should consider applying for it. And would you mind sharing your credentials with us as to why we should listen to you sure. Um, so hi everyone. My name is like Kajuria. Um, I was a former academic foundation program trainee working in London at Imperial College of London. I have been running a course over the last three years. I've been the founder and chairman of a high-yield UK. We've trained roughly 300 to 400 students over the last three years and we've received fantastic feedback and please to say that students have been successful in getting posts after attending our courses. Also, anchor has written a book called AFP Secrets. And I discovered this book like a day before my AFP interview in London. And I didn't get it. I got reserved listed. But I feel like how I discovered this sooner and actually put it into practice. I might have stood a better chance than the London interview. I completely agree. So, uh, I just sent a message and what's up. I was like, hey, would you would you mind filming an interview about the AFP? Because there's not much information online about the AFP. It's all kind of stuck behind kind of like random people. You've got to know someone who's gotten into it to get the best tips. So, this will hopefully give you a good start as to how to prepare for your AFP interview. And yeah, you can buy the book or you can attend the course or whatever. Yeah. Cool. So, um, would you mind, can we start by talking about you like briefly why should people do the AFP? Sure. Okay. So, um, I feel AFP is for two sorts of people. First one, uh, who noticed they want to pursue a career in academic medicine. They've done lots of research through medical school, um, and, uh, want this as the stepping stone to pursue an integrated academic career. Okay. Uh, and then you have, uh, the other group, uh, who are not sure if academia is for them, uh, and they want to try it out. And this provides a very nice introduction into what life as an academic would be like. Okay. Uh, you get to spend in most formats, uh, during a research project, usually in your second year, um, in certain regions, for example Oxford, uh, you do get a day release, um, which is spread over the two years. Okay. Um, and, uh, after the two years, um, you can either continue to pursue your academic interest, or you can say, look, this is not for me. I want to follow just a clinical pathway, which is, which is equally valid. Okay. Also, uh, and as you guys might know, the AFP sort of sets stands apart from the normal foundation program, and that you apply for F-pass, but then you if you apply for the AFP, and you go in the AFP post, that removes you from the foundation program, or the normal thing, although you pretty much do five normal rotations, and one researcher at a time, as you said, in our places. Uh, I would say there's nothing to lose from applying. Um, it's, uh, it's, uh, it's a, it's a little bit more work in terms of, uh, uh, uh, writing your white space answers, and, uh, obviously, attending the interview. Uh, but I think it's, uh, fantastic, uh, learning experience. Uh, you get, uh, really good interview practice, uh, which will be really useful for your future interviews, as a, of course, electrical training, your medical training, as special teams of use, uh, and also later on as an SD3 interview. Yeah, and I can completely echo that actually, like, I, as, you know, I didn't get the AFP, um, but I attended both my interviews. Yeah, I found them really useful, and now I kind of know what to expect in future job interviews, and I know the things that need to work on, and if I hadn't applied for the AFP, I would never have had that information up, up until like, you know, the SD1 or the SD3 interview. So I think it was really good that I applied even though I didn't get it. Yeah. So I would, yeah. If you're thinking about it, I'd encourage you to apply. Might as well. You have nothing to lose. And it's not the end of the world. If you don't get the post, it does not mean that you can't follow or pursue a Korean academia. There are lots of other opportunities. Um, so we'll talk about this later, but there's the integrated academic pathway. So you have an AFP, which is the start of the pathway, then you have an academic local fellowship, and subsequently academic local lectureships, and clinical lectures, lectureships. But you can enter that path at any time. So it doesn't matter if you've not done an AFP, you can still apply for an ACF. If you've not done an ACF, you can apply for a PhD, and subsequently apply for a senior lecture role. So it doesn't really limit you. Really depends on if you're truly passionate about academia. Sweet. So not getting into AFP is not a big deal, but, you know, having the AFP is sort of helpful if you want to go into that. Absolutely. Absolutely. Wonderful. Okay, so we talked about the AFP, we talked about why you should apply if you're interested in research, or you know, just for the laws you can apply anyway, just to get them into the, in to be practice. Mind is standing at the end of these. So I had an interview in London and an interview in EBH. Well, the EBH interview was very sort of personal based, you know, as questions about your application about why it's based questions, why do you want to do the AFP, that sort of thing? Whereas in London there were two stations. One of them was a critical appraisal station, where we got an abstract to look at for half an hour in advance, and we had to critique the abstract. And the second was the clinical emergencies, where we got like a little scenario saying that you're the FY1 and A&E, there's this patient, this patient, and this patient, how would you, how would you proceed, and we was like a discussion with the consultants about about this and that. So can you start by giving us some tips about the clinical emergency station? Okay, so that was a very quick overview of why you might want to apply for the AFP and pretty much we said, you might as well, you don't really have anything to lose other than the time you waste kind of doing the white space questions. And to be honest, it's really good interview practice for general life just kind of having having the interviews. So thank you very much for watching. If you liked the video, please give it a thumbs up. If you haven't subscribed, please consider doing so. The next video in this series is going to be about how to prepare for the clinical emergency station. So that'll be coming in your subscribe inbox soon at some point. But thank you for watching and I'll see you in the next video. Bye bye.
