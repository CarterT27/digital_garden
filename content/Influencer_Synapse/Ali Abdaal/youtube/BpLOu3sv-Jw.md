## Transcript
 So, earlier this year, me and group adopters from Cambridge travel to Sudan for a medical mission trip. With a team of Sudanese doctors, healthcare professionals and medical students from Podthum University, we set up six medical clinics in villages in northern Sudan. This is the Sudan Medical Adventure. Day 1, we arrived in 4thum and head to restaurant in the city centre. Welcome to Dan. This is our first day in the trip. We've all just landed and we're having our first organisational team meeting with the rest of the doctors. We drive through the city across the river Nile to our host family's house. And I apparently run the entire length of the country pretty much so we'll be seeing at various different points in our journey. It's very exciting. And then get demolished at FIFA by the medical students before heading to bed. Day 2, we wake at the Crack of Dawn and head to Houghton University Medical School with boxes full of drugs and other medical supplies. So, this here is our box of drugs and syringes and things. They've come from different companies. And they've supported us with some financial support. We make friends with some of the students there who treat us to some traditional Sudanese food. Cheers. Cheers. Oh, that's a nice. Then we load up the bus and join the 75 students and 20 doctors, lab technicians and pharmacists, and head to 500 kilometers north to Merui. So we're about halfway through the journey. We've been driving for the last four hours. And all there is around us is just desert. After eight hours of driving through the desert, we arrive at the resort, debrief and head to our room. Wow, it is. Yes, mate. Oh, we've got balcony as well. Isn't that really pretty? It's going to be a solid spot to fly the drone from tomorrow morning. Day 3 is when the fun really starts. We split up into three teams, each with 25 medical students and a handful of doctors and lab technicians. My team drives an hour through the desert to reach a village called Village 5. We set up our clinic at the local primary school and for the rest of the day, the medical students see all of the patients with our team of doctors overseeing the process. All right, so this is the school that we've been in for the past day. And here's how the patient flow works. So the patients dot off in the triage area over there. And that's where they get seen by some of our doctors and some of our fourth here medical students. And they take a quick history, do their vital signs, so their pulse, blood pressure, respiratory and kind of triage them as to how urgently they need to be seen. Then once the patient has been triaged, they get given this form and they can check one of the clinic rooms over there. And we've been in these clinic rooms all day. Just kind of seeing the patients as they come in. Taking a full history, doing an examination. And then some patients just need reassurance and a bit of analgesia. They can get that from the pharmacy, which is over there. We've got a pharmacist, we've got a supply of drugs, but then some patients need further investigations. So then we send them over to our hematology and biochemistry lab that we've got set up. And that's where we can do things like a full blood count. Uria electrolytes, urinalysis, fecal analysis, that sort of stuff. And then they come back to the clinic and then we sort them out based on the results of those investigations. So this is actually a pretty great setup. The medical students see the patients and talk to them in Arabic. And then when they're done, they present the case to one of the doctors and we double check the management plan. This means that overall we provide a really good, cost-effective service for patients who don't normally get to see doctors. And at the same time, we're helping train up the medical students in their clinical reasoning and physical examination skills. And rather than just providing a medical and educational service, we also provide some entertainment for the local schoolchildren by busting out the drone and letting them play with it a little bit. They've bought is our final clinical day. And so our three teams drive to three more villages in northern Sudan. Alright, so here we are in the village of Al-Bahik. We came here this morning and again it's the same sort of a yesterday. I mean, I have two three hours rooms, one for the men and one for the women. And then we've got two clinic rooms that they get triaged into. And then we've got our pharmacy and we've got our lab going on. Overall, it's been pretty chill today. It's quite as many patients as we had yesterday. So there was quite a good opportunity to teach some of the medical students. We ran through the cardiovascular, the cranial nerves, the knee examination. And these guys have been really friendly. They've got food for us, which was very tasty. And they're so generous. They've given us kind of a bunch of different types of meat. And there's this common here. It's actually the sheep's distance. So with our bellies, comfortably full with sheep and testin, we drive back to the resort to deeply. We get together with the other teams. Share some presentations about interesting cases that we'd all seen across the two days. And Roberta's team deliver the performance of a traditional Arabic song for everyone and the team. All right. So it's final day of the trip. We've done our two days in the medical mission. And this morning, we spent a couple of hours doing some lectures for the medical students. We did a talk about research methods in medicine. We did talk about how to prepare for exams, such as the postgraduate medical exams like the MRCP. And now we're going to spend the rest of the day just hanging out with the students and the other doctors. At the moment, we're by the river Nile. It's just the river Nile. And then we're going to head back to Fartou. Just going to be a fun little bus journey. Hopefully see some permits on the way. You know, have a nice social bonding experience. So that was our medical adventure in Sudan. Over the five days, we explored some of the beautiful landscape. We saw and treated hundreds of patients who would have otherwise have very limited access to healthcare. And we made friends with some absolutely wonderful pharmacists, technicians, medical students, and doctors along the way. Thank you for watching.
