## Transcript
 Good morning! It's now time for us to say goodbye to Phnom Penh. It's been an amazing six weeks here, but now we are journey north to Batonbong, so we'll see you there. And here we are outside our Airbnb with our thing, so let's take a look inside. Okay, this place is pretty cool. Apparently there's a swimming pool as well. Okay, this is pretty awesome. We definitely got a good deal over here. It's just nice and old too. This is amazing. Yes, I'm really doing keep over here. And I want to jump in. The laundry service, oh, we could call a master for a private massage in your room. Prices in an information room are quite fantastic. This has been a pretty delicate afternoon. We've just been chilling by the poolside, doing some video editing, Hopping in for a swim every now and then. This place is just so great. They were paying for my idea there. Now we're off to find dinner, someone. I think we just got off to some kind of rock. I got came up to us asking if we wanted to tuck our most bike, and we were like, no thank you. And then he kind of came up beside us and said, looking, sort of in a questioning fashion. I think it's because I'm wearing this outfit. I don't usually wear something like this. It's called all my cheese shirt for the laundry. What do you guys think is a good look? We're a bit lost. We're just going to walk and hopefully find some more. Ben's not lost. Ben's not lost, okay. Ben is very fine. I was very good to have this like a shaking car. This mango is served with you. For some reason, people in Cambodia like to eat their mangoes. They're not quite right. So they're always a bit green and a bit crunchy. I reckon during season they're not green and crunchy, it's just because we're all season. Why is the mango season? Mango season is like a good thing. That was so good. We've got an early start tomorrow. We've got a whole day trip planned with one of the tour guides. Along the river side in Batonbong. They seem to have these gym equipment things that anyone can just use. So on our way home, we thought we'd just get a cheeky workout in. And then when we get home, we're going to do 50 press ups. That's the plan anyway. All right, everyone. It's been a wonderful day. Thank you so much for hanging around for the ride. Can I go from midnight swim? I'll see you tomorrow. Bye.
