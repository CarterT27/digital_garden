## Transcript
 Hi, I'm Catherine. I'm Leo. We're medical students here at Cambridge. And we're also six men instructors for the evening at Crash Course. And we head to tell you a little bit about that. The courses themselves run from August to November each year, and run all across the country, London, Manchester, Birmingham, as well as internationally, in Amsterdam, Spain and Singapore. The courses are a focus to one day of there. We have two instructors, medical students from Oxford, or Cambridge. Every student gets a copy of our BMAT Crash Course Workbook. As well as online access to BMAT Ninja, our database of over 1,000 BMAT questions. As for the structure of the courses themselves, in the morning, we're going to be doing Section 1, which is critical thinking and problem-solving skills. We're going to be going over some tips and tricks with this section, and also doing some time for questions. We spend most of the afternoon on Section 2, which is the science system. We know a lot of our students get a little bit worried about the physics, especially if they haven't done it at a level. So we teach you all of the physics you need to know, together with the tricky events for biology and chemistry, with plenty of practice time questions along the way. The final element of the opening, we're going to spend on Section 3, which is the essays section. We're going to plan to solve the essay as a class together, and we're also going to go away for some time management skills, which are pretty important to actually write the essay. Even after you finish the course, you have free access to our online notes and questions on BMAT Ninja, as well as unlimited support from our lovely team of medical students via email or telephone. Well, facts or caribition or wherever you like. Every single student, so far, I said they would recommend the course to a friend, except for one guy who said that he didn't want to spend the same advice that he knows. But feel free to have a look at our reviews page on our website, BMATcrashcourse.com. If you want to see what students have to say in their own words about our courses, on there you'll also find loads of details about cool states, costs, and also our burst risk scheme, for people who are in financial difficulties. And here at six minutes, we also have the crash courses for the UK cat and the interview, so you can find links for those two if that's what players should buy. If you've got any questions at all, our contact details on the website. So thanks for watching, and we hope to see you soon. Bye. Bye. That was a bit too weird. Yeah, that's a bit weird again.
