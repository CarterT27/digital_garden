## Transcript
 So before I did the clich√© YouTube thing and bought a Tesla Model 3, I was really worried about the road trip situation. Would it be reasonable to take the car and long road trips and how much hassle would it be to charge the car? Would I be worried about running out of battery midway through the trip? How comfortable would it be and how would the autopilot work in real life? So this is the video I wish I would have seen before at bought the car. It is not a review of the Tesla Model 3. It's a review of what it's like to take the Tesla Model 3 on a 1,400 mile road trip to the Scottish Highlands, in torrential rain and freezing weather with a car full of five people. And I will tell you upfront, it was an interesting experience for a lot of different reasons. So let's start with the good stuff and then we'll talk about the not so good stuff. So let's start with comfort, acceleration and autopilot. Thankfully the car is really comfortable as the driver. Not quite as the passenger but we'll come to that in a second. It's really comfortable as the driver. When you sit down in the seat it genuinely feels like you're sitting in a sofa and it's got like fancy electronic seat controls so you can set up the height to whatever you like. You can raise the seat up and down. It's even got a lumber back support thing that you can sort of use to sort of massage yourself if you get it in exactly the right position and really lean back against it. But in general it's very, very solid and very comfortable. Alright let's car is really not good for the back pain. Oh my little back feels absolutely right. The only thing is for me after about two hours of driving I was getting consistent kind of lower back pain. Now this would happen in my old car as well. So I think maybe that's just me but the Tesla Model 3 did not cure my lower back pain problem after sitting in that one kind of position for two hours. It's also pretty good because you can save different like a driver configurations to the car. So if I'm driving I have my seat in a certain position but then if my mom wants to drive she can just select her profile and the car will like the seat will automatically move and until it's in the position that she wants it out. But overall comfort nothing to complain about. I do genuinely enjoy driving the car. It genuinely feels very comfortable and just in general when I'm driving the Tesla Model 3 I kind of feel like it feels like a joy to drive and I think that's partly because of the comfort. Let's talk about acceleration now and the acceleration is absolutely ridiculous. I've got the Tesla Model 3 long range version so I did not pay for the performance version and I've not paid for any acceleration upgrades. The Note to 60 of my version without any upgrades is 3.4 seconds and from 0 to 60 it feels genuinely sickening at times and occasionally when I get to have new people in the car and someone's like oh hey I've heard the acceleration is really fast can we can we try it out? I'm like are you sure about this and like we sit down? We get the car to 0 and then we just floor the accelerator and go straight. People were always like oh my god oh god and then they kind of feel like a set of kind of feel sick afterwards. The car actually has two driving modes. It's got acceleration standard and it's got acceleration chill. Now I actually prefer to drive it on acceleration chill where the acceleration is more manageable and it feels like a smoother drive whereas on acceleration standard that's when you really notice it when you're like sort of at a traffic light and there are three cars and you're all going in the same direction at that point I flip it to standard and I'm like all right lads here we go. It goes green light, floor the accelerator is zoom so far ahead of everyone else leave them in my dust or whatever the phrases but yeah the acceleration is absolutely mental. If you want you can pay 1,500 pounds I think it's 1,500 dollars as well in America for another over the air software upgrade that makes it go up to 2.9 seconds 0 to 60 I think 3.4 seconds is too fast personally for me I'm not much of a car guy I have a bit conservative a little bit vanilla and so I'm not going to pay for this 1,500 pound 2.9 second acceleration upgrade because this is just completely unnecessary. Thirdly let's talk about the autopilot now the autopilot is absolutely incredible. Technically it's not really an autopilot it is instead a traffic aware cruise control. So what that means is that it's going to accelerate up to the speed limit but it's going to make sure it's your safe distance behind the car in front of you and it's going to follow the markings Now this is actually really really useful it basically functions as an autopilot if you're on kind of a long stretch of road for a long time so I usually put on this autopilot anytime I have to drive more than 2 miles on like one stretch of road because then I can just sit back and let the car do all the work for me and in fact on this road trip to Scotland we were driving kind of on motorways for 200 miles at a time and that was like super chill because like literally the autopilot would just drive all of the way there. The only thing to keep in mind if you're doing this autopilot is that you have to move the steering wheel every 15 seconds or so like the car will flash saying touch the steering wheel and then you just have to twiddle it a little bit and then it's like okay cool you're still awake you're still alive that's all fine but if you keep your hands off the steering wheel for too long then the car starts to flash and go mental and then it starts to make a sound and then if you leave it too long then it will just disable autopilot for the rest of your drive so it's like the car is punishing you and the first time I tried this I remember actually I had this like bad feeling in my in my stomach was like oh I've disappointed my car because I've broken the rules I'm sorry but like very quickly you get used to having this kind of position where you've got like one finger on the steering wheel and you can just twiddle it when you see the the blue light flashing on your when your console thing and it basically means the car arrives itself but it's not so fully autopilot that you can just sit down and have an apple something okay so autopilot is pretty cool it's on traffic about cruise control so as soon as this car's in front start moving forward without me having to do anything it's gonna also move forward there we go yep I'm moving no hands just keeping one hand on the steering wheel just to make sure I can do anything in an emergency but otherwise just to kind of chill and it works pretty well so right now the car is basically driving itself and I'm very occasionally giving the wheel a slide tool when it tells me just to let it know that I'm just holding onto the wheel and I kind of know what's going on this one hand twiddling thing you actually get used to very quickly and now three months in I really love using the autopilot and whenever I am I'm using it I still feel wow this is absolutely magical how the car is basically driving itself so for long road trips if you're going on road trips this is a total game changer because it just drives for ages at a time but also if you're going through traffic this is a total game changer as well and like I said I haven't paid for any further upgrades to the car so this does not have the full self driving mode or any kind of automatic lane changes or merging onto the sidorams or anything like that all it does is just go in a straight line kind of following the lane and not hitting the car in front of you which is completely fine for my needs maybe when the self driving capabilities in the UK get better I'll be upgrading to that but right now there is not a lot of difference between non-full self driving and full self driving other than the fact you have to pay 7,000 pounds for it which is something that I'm not prepared to do just yet. Now the only bad thing about the autopilot is that you do get occasional moments of fear so for example when we were driving in this cottage highlands like of these mountains and down these mountains and stuff technically the speed limit would be like 60 or 70 miles per hour and so the car would be trying to go at 60 or 70 miles per hour but when it's pouring down with rain and you know the road is windy and you know this car's coming in front of you and it just and you know like you're on the side of a mountain where if you go off the edge it would be a bad thing it feels really really scary to use the autopilot because it's still tries to get you to that 60 miles per hour and then you just like ah so we used it a little bit while we were in the mountains but for the most part we were driving ourselves it is kind of nice when you're in the mountains and going on windy roads to do it yourself and I'm sure the autopilot wouldn't have crashed us into something but it just feels so scary when you when autopilot is making you go at 60 and you've got a car and like the narrow road coming out you're like oh no please please don't hit it it's it's like absolutely terrifying so I personally was too much of a coward to use the autopilot while I was in the mountains but it was fantastic for the motorway all right we've talked about the good stuff let's talk about the not so good stuff and let's start by talking about range anxiety and this is such a real thing I'd seen some videos about it but I did quite believe how much of a deal range anxiety is now I've gone for the long range Tesla Model 3 which has an advertised range of 329 miles and in fairness when I'm driving in the south of England where it's not rainy all the time and where the weather is reasonable I think the car has about a range of about 300 miles like I can get 300 miles in a single charge if I had to it's not a big deal but when we were in Scotland and it was windy and freezing and torrentially raining the cars range was nowhere near that 329 miles it was in fact closer to 200 miles and that is such a big difference in terms of range we also found that we couldn't quite rely on the cars advertised range so when you set a destination in the Tesla sort of screen thing it uses Google Maps and it tells you how much battery it thinks you'll have by the time the by the time you get to your destination and there were lots of times on this trip to Scotland where we just didn't trust it because it was projecting we would have like 8% battery left on a destination but then we would have 8% at that point and we'd have to drive another 15 minutes and we'd think oh I don't know this is worth it I don't know if we're going to be able to make it to a supercharge the next day I don't know if we're going to have like there's all these extra sort of mental components of driving a Tesla on a long road trip where you really are worried about the range especially when the weather conditions aren't great all right guys this is a problem so we've basically run out of battery we're on 9% charge which ran out a lot sooner than we were expecting so now we've come to Edinburgh airport to try and find a supercharger with a road through really windy and where we'll kind of feel like we're gonna be sick oh we found it in fairness when we were on the road trip we tried our best to conserve battery apparently if you have the actual heating on it uses more battery whereas if you just use the heated seats it uses less battery so we were kind of using heated seats it was pretty cold and so we had to do this juggling of like well how do we juggle kind of how cold we are versus making sure we've got enough battery to get to our destination in time also if you're at the point where it reckons you're going to sort of run out of battery by the time you get to the next charger it tells you stay under 60 miles per hour to get to your destination with some battery left otherwise you're going to run out or stay under 70 miles per hour or whatever so that was useful to have but again it was a bit annoying because it was like well yeah it's it is stuff that you have to think about that you really don't have to think about when you have a petrol or a diesel car so we've talked about range anxiety let's now talk about charging and now this is another whole kind of fish whole kettle of worms I don't know if that's the right face Keffler fish kind of worms who knows but basically when it comes to charging if you're within the supercharger network it's absolutely fine like in most of England and in sort of the south bit of Scotland there are reasonable amounts of superchargers and so basically whenever you need to you can always lightly you know go to a service station supercharge the car it takes about an hour to go from zero to a hundred percent basically for a full charge and when you're at the service station you can do what we do and just eat and make Donald's or a burger king or a subway and just kind of chill all right we just have some burger king the car has charged from 17% up to about 95% in the last and long been here we've been here about an hour so an hour for basically a full charge from 17% that's pretty good vibes all right so here is a map of all the different superchargers in England and you will see there are quite a lot of them in the south of England but the issue is that when you go into Scotland and Scotland is where we were going you really don't have very many at all so we charged up once in Edinburgh we charged up in Perth we charged up in Aviemore and in Venice and the sort of area we were exploring was this sort of northern bit of Scotland and so there was there was not a single supercharger kind of north and west of in Venice and it was a problem because we were relying on Scotland's third party charger network now this is actually a thing like they've got like third party charging points throughout like the north 500 trail throughout like the north of Scotland and you can find them on an app the problem was is that we didn't know that you had to register for one of these in advance and get a physical card which you would have to plug into these charges for them to work the app for some reason that we read because we assumed it's the 21st century it's 2020 guys sure you can just do stuff on an app the only thing the app would let us do is use the slow charging features and so it Tesla supercharger would charge the car from 0 to 100% in one hour a third party fast charger would probably take a few hours but would still get you a lot of charge but then the slow chargers were giving us like six kilowatt hours it was taking like six hours to get like 30% battery like it was taking absolutely ages to charge the car partly I'm sure this was our fault for not knowing about this thing but it was one of the things we just didn't think about because like well when you have a normal car you just don't have to worry about charging but when you have a Tesla Model 3 you really do have to worry about charging all right a few more problems so firstly in some supercharger destinations for Tesla and in some of them you have like 20 different superchargers so you know there's always going to be space but specifically in Edinburgh airport where we had to charge up on one morning we got there and there were already two Tesla's in the two spaces because they only had two spaces and the problem was there was already someone waiting okay this is slightly problematic so the battery is on 66% at the moment and we are at Edinburgh airport trying to supercharge it but there are already two Tesla's charging using and there is another Tesla Model 3 that's waiting to charge so we're in a queue now in theory we could go all the way up to Avymor which will be 124 miles and take 236 minutes and it reckons will be on 20% battery by the time we get there so the only question is do we trust the estimation on the Tesla that we're actually gonna have 20% battery by the time we get there or is there a risk of running out the alternative is that we wait here to be supercharged or we potentially go up to Perth and then supercharge over there so we've got some options but I don't think we want to wait here for an extended period of time just to wait for other cars to get charged up so this wasn't the end of the world because we did have an option but is again it's just one of those things that we didn't think about I just sort of assumed that when it says there is a supercharger on Tesla on the map thing you go to the supercharger and you'll find a space but specifically in Edinburgh airport we did not have a space and now we get to the best part of the trip and the most memorable part of the trip which was possibly also the worst part of the trip and that was the charging situation north of Inveness some of the time this was actually completely reasonable all right that was actually remarkably painless we managed to register set up a payment card and charge the car now we're gonna grab some breakfast but at other times it was a total nightmare all right so absolutely pouring down with rain we are at this third party charger installation and we applied it into the car but we're trying to figure out how to actually download the app to pay for it because it's not entirely obvious how we did it as we found for some reason none of the fast chargers in the whole of Scotland were working for us and we spoke to some dude who had a Nissan leaf and he said oh yeah you've got to apply for this EV charging card and that unlocks the fast chargers and we were just like oh my god why this is stupid it's 2020 guys come on just like make it available in the app why do you have to get a physical card and then you unlock fast charging all right up there there is basically no charger in Scotland that can fast chargers so we're gonna slow charge using AC and that means we're gonna be here for the next few hours and our sightseeing around sky is a complete myth because it's not gonna happen but hey it's raining anyway so it wasn't gonna happen anyway so for most of the rest of the trip we were relying on the slow charging of Scotland's third party electric charging network this was again it was reasonable we had to change up our route a lot and we couldn't do a lot of the sightseeing that we wanted to do but in fairness it was like raining and foggy and misty anyway and so that would have been pretty grim but we did spend a lot more time in service stations and in coffee shops than we'd originally expected because we thought this was going to be a road trip to Scotland and to see the sides and take photos and got brought the drone along and all that stuff but sometimes the slow chargers didn't work either right we have a tricky 10 minutes to the nearest French restaurant where I could do a wee wee and we can get some food while we wait for the route was the bring up freaking electric car where the rain does not as advertised in the torrential wind and rain that person is not very clever say this honestly was probably the most memorable and the most grim moment of the trip it was we were all wet and miserable and freezing and we had to wait like six hours in a coffee shop for the car to charge up to the point where it had like 40% battery which would get us to our Airbnb by nightfall and we had to trudge through like 15 minutes of absolutely torrential rain and wind with the umbrellas flying out everywhere and not working to get to this coffee shop because we were in some random Scottish town in the middle of nowhere alright so we found a place to shelter in for a couple of hours and I was here and we just got our routes to the Airbnb tonight with an off-charge how are you feeling yeah we're cold but but our optimistic and what road trip were the last five hours later all right guys so we've been hanging out in this cafe for the last few hours we've charged up from 6% to 46% which should in theory give us a projected range of about a hundred and six miles and the place we have to get to is 80 miles so in theory we should get to our Airbnb with some charged despair and there's hopefully another charger closer closer to our place that'll work so we're gonna aim for that one now just gonna get the boys to come in the car and we will continue this somewhat miserable but still quite enjoyable road trip so overall we were never quite stranded because of the charging situation but we did have to massively change up our entire trip because there is that serious anxiety of guys there is no way we can run out of battery before we hit our our next Airbnb destination what we're gonna do next time is that we're gonna we're gonna carry a long-ass extension cable because what you can do is you can plug your Tesla into just a normal wall outlet and again this charger slowly I think it's about six to eight miles per hour of charge so for every hour of charging you get about six to eight miles on a Tesla Model 3 which is actually reasonable because if you do it overnight then six times eight times 12 is 96 you get about a hundred ish miles provided you're leaving it just for 12 hours and often we're leaving it for more than 12 hours and so if we carry just a long extension cable and just have it in the back it means we've got the option of charging overnight at our Airbnb's by just running an extension cable from the house all the way into the car park and being comfortable with charging the car overnight then and in fact when the car is parked at home I don't have a super charger or anything I don't have a war charger I just use a long-ass extension cable connected to the mains and just run it outside so that the Tesla plugs into the mains power supply in terms of charging costs we had to charge one set of a service station overnight that cost ¬£21.90 for a hundred percent charge overall our super charger receipts came to 84 pounds and 49 and the third party stations came to about ¬£20 which meant that our total cost of charging for the 1400 miles was ¬£126.39 and actually this was a slightly cheaper than my old Nissan Note but not by very much I think it's because the third party charges were overcharging us compared to the superchargers but if I had done this trip on my old 2011 Nissan Note which has a mass per gallon of about 55 diesel 117 people later that would have cost ¬£135.40 so we only really saved about ¬£10 which is about 13 dollars by going Tesla Model 3 longer range rather than by going Nissan Note let's talk about there's a more slightly annoying things about the Tesla Model 3 and next we're talking about the passenger experience now when you have one or two people in the back seat it's actually very comfortable it's a very nice ride it's shell people are like oh these white seats are cool it's a Tesla Model 3 isn't this novel but when you have three people in the back it actually becomes quite uncomfortable for them especially if they're like tall so all of the guys we had in the back were like between five, nine and six foot and so reasonably tall and it was just very very uncomfortable I also one of the guys Torek was sitting in the back a lot about how he felt about the comfort level of the car in the middle is not bad I think it's on the side where you're kind of angled where you're going to sit a constantly strain your back a little's good you can let your legs out and so after the long days of driving like I would have the low back pain from being kind of in the passenger's in the driver's seat for a very long time the person in the passenger seat would be pretty chill because they'd have like nice legroom and it would be good but the three guys in the back especially the guys sitting on on the sides where your legs are sort of angled into the car because actually there's not a huge amount of legroom because the battery at the bottom takes up a huge amount of space so in a normal car you're sort of sitting in a sort of sitting position whereas in a Tesla your your knees are sort of a little bit higher and so you know you can get the hip flex a pain you get the low back pain these things on like relevant if if you're just in the car for like an hour or two but if you're in the car for like 12 hours of the day you're really so to notice it and therefore each night we would put on this like mobility and stretching routine at the night time just to try and get the pain out of our backs the nice things about the passenger experience though are that the seats in the back are heated as well so that was kind of novel and it's got two USB-C charging ports at the back so no one's phone was ever at risk running out of next let's talk about the in-car entertainment and the sound system so everyone says that when you're in a Tesla the sound system is fantastic and yeah it was pretty good but you know when we're driving on motorways for extended periods of time it actually is really really really loud and I was kind of hoping the Tesla Model 3 would be a lot quieter than it actually is it's like ridiculously quiet if you're driving an under 30 miles per hour because you don't hear the noise of the engine because the reason it knows the engine but when you're driving on a motorway and there's rain and other cars outside you actually get a lot of and it just feels like you're in a normal car and honestly I don't notice much of a subject of difference between the sort of road noise in the Tesla Model 3 versus the road noise in my Nissan Note which also had the sound of the engine and so if we wanted to listen to music or a podcast or an audio book while driving on a motorway you would have to have the volume pretty loud like about 80% to be able to hear what was being said again this is something I sort of wish I'd known known beforehand because I kind of had high hopes, high expectations about the Tesla Model 3 people saying oh it's so quiet and I thought oh my god I'll be able to silently listen to my audio book while driving on a motorway but that is absolutely not the case if you're driving slowly on you know city roads with lots of traffic yes you don't hear any noise but if you're driving on a motorway you get a shit ton of noise and it's really annoying the nice thing about the in-car entertainment system is that you do have that big screen and so some of the time when we were at pit stops or if we were stopping at a service station or at a third party charging station to charge the car instead of getting out we would sit in the car and we would watch stuff on the screen so it's got YouTube it's got Netflix and when you buy the car you get one free year of like Tesla connectivity and then I think it costs about ¬£10 a month after that so you get like unlimited internet straight into your car which is quite nice so we were occasionally occasionally watch clips from what I like to you I think we even put on a Netflix show at one point and that was like a surprisingly good experience so that's like a nice part of having the car you're charging stops stopping annoying and you actually just like hey I could just watch something on TV finally let's do a comparison with a normal car so what would have been like to do the road trip in the Nissan Note my old 2011 car that I've got 180,000 miles on the clock that I've been driving since like 2016 honestly I think I think the trip would have been less hassle if we had a petrol or diesel car because you just don't have to worry about the charging but I also think it would have been less fun and like for us the point of this road trip wasn't really to see the sights it was more just to hang out with a boy isn't just to have a nice time and when you have this thing of this shared adversity this like shared chaotic experience so some more traumatizing experience when you're struggling to find charges in the range of anxiety and the fact that the cars range is not advertised in cold and windy and wet weather conditions and the fact that you're freezing cold and soaked to the bone and you're umbrella's not working because the winds are too heavy all of that stuff we wouldn't really have had that if we were just going in a normal car or if we'd rented like a 4 by 4 or something we would have been a lot more comfortable but I think we would have had a lot less fun and I think in a way that trip was a good bonding experience and it was a bonding experience because of the adversity and because of the struggle and therefore in a way it was kind of good that we took the trip in a Tesla Model 3 we are planning another road trip in a few months time and it remains to be seen whether the guys will want to go back in the Tesla I'm all for it because the driver seat is really comfortable or whether the guys will just think you know what let's just hire a 4 by 4 you know Land Rover or something whatever I just I have a big comfortable car that we can just use for the weekend I suspect that's probably the road that we're going to go down so that was overall the experience of driving a Tesla Model 3 for a 1400 mile road trip overall I enjoyed it I thought it was fun but certainly not a stress free experience if you like this video you should check out the video over here where I talk about how I bought my Tesla half price or you can check out the video over here which talks about the delivery day and the experience of driving the car for the first time thank you so much for watching and I'll see you in the next video bye
