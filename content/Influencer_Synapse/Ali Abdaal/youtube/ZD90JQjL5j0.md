## Transcript
 Hey guys welcome back to the channel. If you're new here, my name is Ali and I'm a junior doctor working in Cambridge and I've just had my very first long day shift and this is going to be a video where I just like talk about it and I don't really know what I'm going to say. I'm just going to freestyle this. We'll see what we'll see how it ends up but I think this is the sort of video that I would have really appreciated back when I was eight applying to medicine and be a medical student because I think hopefully it'll be just kind of a raw look at what being a doctor is actually like because often and this is definitely the case for me and most people in my area this idea of like becoming a doctor is much more glamorous than actually being a doctor but having said that today it was quite fun so the way it works at my hospital is that when we have a long day that lasts from eight thirty in the morning to about nine thirty in the evening and up until about six p.m. we're just doing our general day today award duties so I'm on the cardiology award as my first placement so that involves going on the ward round with the team in the morning and then as you know jobs come up I go off to the doctor's office and do the jobs so often that's stuff like writing and discharge summary so a patient can go home or writing like a transfer letter so we can transfer them to the adjacent cardiothoracic hospital. Occasionally it's also stuff like for example if we've got a patient who's got some interesting infection that were not quite sure how to treat we were discussed with the infectious diseases team or if we've got a patient who is on who's on incident who's diabetic and we're not quite sure what's happening with our incident we might contact the diabetic team about that and there's like loads of different teams in the hospital that are all specialising in our little stuff so as you know as the cardiology team our specialties obviously the heart and when it comes to other stuff that's kind of beyond our our remit as hot doctors even though we all kind of come across this stuff in medical school even so we still want to discuss it with the team that's been dealing with it for their whole life so that's a big part of the job doing referrals to other teams and actually on that note I remember a few a few days ago I tried making a referral to the vascular surgery team and making a referral is a really a really kind of stressful stress-inducing experience or it can be because what you have to do when making a referral is that you have to phone up a registrar who is a medic who's like five or six years older than you are probably and you have to try and kind of sell the story to them you've got to make them think that it's worth their time to see your patient is to think you know why it's relevant to them so we had a patient who had some problems like with eschemia which is lack of blood supply to his legs and I called the vascular surgeon the vascular surgery registrar asking him if he could review the patient and then this registrar to start started asking me lots of questions he was like okay uh is is the patient a smoker it's like I don't know it's like okay all what signs of eschemia of his leg does he have I was like I know so that's a good question I don't know it was like has he got any vascular risk factors I don't know he would ask why is the patient in hospital and because I hadn't read through the notes like you know in depth I actually didn't quite know how to explain why the patient was in hospital and actually I just thought you've picked up the phone and say hey your vascular surgery can you review this guy he's got an ischemic leg that's you know vascular surgical problem isn't it but actually I realized that after this after this call and after getting absolutely destroyed over the phone that's you know you'd kind of do need to prepare when making a referral they're a doctor with loads of experience or a lot older than you are and you need to tell them exactly why you're calling them exactly what you're asking for for since then I've made lots of other referrals and it's gone less badly because now I spent a lot of time preparing my spiel for what I'm going to say so for example this is a 71 year old gentleman who's in hospital because of effective endocarditis the reason I'm calling you specifically is because we've grown this bacteria in his blood cultures and we're not quite sure of what antibiotic choice as the microbiology register or ask the infectious disease register or what would you recommend given that we've what we've done this so you're asking them a very very specific question based on a clinical picture and then they can you know they're much more nice when they're you know replying to you and giving you giving you advice so that's another big part of the job so yeah in general that's pretty much what an F1 does you go the wardrobe and you see the patients and then you go off and do the jobs and at my hospital in in Cambridge because it's an entirely electronic system a lot of the stuff a lot of the general admin that other doctors around the UK have to we pretty much don't have to do because let's say we get a call and we're in a different office about prescribing the certain drug and we know the patient and we know we can prescribe it we can just like type in a few things on the system and it automatically gets prescribed rather than having to go all the way to the ward right it by hand in a drug chart and and do all that stuff so a lot of the day-to-day admin things like you know giving drugs requesting x-rays, requesting blood tests all of the stuff can be managed from just a computer so you have a lot more power and once you get the hang of using this computer system stuff becomes a lot more efficient at least that's what people say I've only been using it for the past few days and I'll already I love it anyway so this is what happened between like eight thirty the morning and six PM at night in the evening but then from six to nine that's when we get four of the F1s the foundation year one doctors to kind of cover basically all of the medical wards in the hospital for those three hours so between six PM and nine PM we pretty much just have to make sure that all of the medical patients survive and you know nothing overly bad happens to them in those three hours because then when it gets to nine PM we can hand over to the night team which I'm more experienced doctors who then manage the whole hospital for the rest of the night so today I had my first one of these evening shifts and from about half past five onwards I started getting calls from various wards so I was covering the cardiology ward the respiratory ward and the gastroenterology ward so I started getting calls from those day teams handing over patients that I that they wanted to look at overnight so there were a few patients on the gastro ward who were going to have CT scans overnight and my job was to review the CT scan as and when it arrived and make sure there was nothing overly bad on it that might be an emergency that we might have to act on in the moment I got some calls from from the renal ward who are getting handing over patients who needed to have them blood checked because they were having some blood tests then again if one of the bloods came back with a really low pH then I'd have to act on it or a really high lactate then I don't have to act on it so it's stuff like that sort of things sort of things left over from the day team that can't really wait until the following morning and this is a big debate that happens in hospitals and around around teams is that to what extent should you hand stuff over to the night team because let's say it's a let's say it's like a random blood test where the results of it won't change anything like there and then that's probably not the kind of thing that you want the night time doctor to review because the night time doctor is covering so many different wards and the night time doctor is pretty much just there to make sure everyone survives the night so only genuinely urgent or emergency things should ideally be handed over to them so I managed to get through these I like this was probably the first time like while I was on this leg shift that I felt like I was anyway a real doctor because like for the last week or so I've been on the cardiology ward I've been the most junior person on the ward and all the all the decisions have been being made by the consultants by the registrars and I'm the one just kind of making them happen by typing into the system or whatever and that's great because I have zero experience in cardiology that the experts were taking care of really sick patients and my hospital can bridge as a tertiary centre so we take in the most complicated patients for more and the region so obviously that's beyond my expertise as yeah fresh out of medical school for about a week but when I was on this leg shift that's when we all like the four of us were and it had a lot more responsibility so I got a call asking me to prescribe some more for info for a patient and I didn't like I suppose I could have called the cardiology registrar or the medical registrar but at that point I'd done it a few times I'd seen it done and therefore I felt comfortable to make the decision for myself as to what drug this patient can have. I also got called to prescribe you know some painkillers for someone else which which wasn't overly overly tough but then there was a patient who needed to have a blood transfusion because their hemoglobin levels were down they were anemic and I got called to prescribe the blood transfusion to kind of write out the form and blood transfusions can be a little bit scary to prescribe because the yours yours have the risk whenever you're transfusing anyone that they'll have a transfusion reaction so ideally they wouldn't have for example if you're familiar with blood types there's AB and O and if you give the wrong blood type to a patient then the chances are quite high that they will die because ABO incompatibility reactions are really really bad because your whole immune system targets that blood and then they'll you get a massive inflammatory response and it's just not good so there's loads of different checks in place to stop people from getting ABO incompatibility so for example you have to take two different blood samples from two different places and like double check them each time and make sure check the patient's details against the blood four times just to make sure this sort of thing never happens in addition to that however there are also other reactions that people can have to transfuse blood so you can get people still getting an anaphylactic reaction to transfused blood even if the ABO blood type matches because of these things called minor adjectives anyway the point is blood transfusion is never 100% safe and therefore it's always a little bit of a scary thing when you're prescribing someone blood because you've run the risk of that you know however small it is that they could have a reaction so it was my job to review the patient's note to go and talk to the patient talk to their family workout if they'd ever had any reactions to transfusion in the past and then ultimately sign my name against this thing and say I'm happy for this patient to be given to you and it's a red blood red blood cells so that was interesting it was quite scary and then there was another sort of scary moment where I was called because one of the patients on the gastro ward was having severe nausea and even having this problem for ages and I was talking to him and he got quite tearful naturally because like nausea is one of the most terrible there I am like arguably nausea is even worse than pain as one of our palate of care consultants once said because pain you can kind of deal with but nausea is just such a debilitating feeling and this guy been suffering with it for the last five weeks and no one really knew what was going on he was in for investigations so he was on two anti-messics anti-signist drugs and the nurse called me asking me to prescribe the third because it just wasn't really the drugs he was on weren't really helping him but the problem is is that anti-messics are quite complicated can be complex drugs there's like six or seven different types they all act in slightly different ways and they all have slightly different effects in that you know let's say your sickness is called by a cause by morphine or chemotherapy then one type of anti-metic agent would be useful let's say it's caused because you've got some electrolyte of normality in your blood then another type of anti-signist agent let's say it's caused because you've got some abdominal issue a third type of anti-signist medication will be useful and these decisions of what sort of anti-signist drugs to give to patients can be very complex and it's not really the sort of thing that I as you know the nighttime emergency on call doctor can be making because they require a long conversation with a patient looking at their entire history looking at all the drugs that they're on trying to work out why this is happening in the first place it's not really the remit of the nighttime staff it's more the remit of the people that are looking after the patient during the daytime anyway so this patient calls I get I get caught to this patient and the patient is quite tearful naturally and I'm unable to get to sleep for the last two days because of this sickness and I wasn't really sure what to do so thankfully you know this is this is why you can always call a senior so I used an apple my phone where I looked up the number for the palliative care specialist this patient wasn't a palliative patient but palliative care specialist specialist doctors are experts at prescribing anti-signist medication because in their last weeks of life palliative care patients often are on you know anti-signist drugs to combat the norms that they can feel so I caught up the doctor and she was really nice over the phone she asked me the history of the patient I explained what I knew and she kind of admitted she was like so sounds like this is quite a complicated patient he had a really complicated history and it sounds like you're not really equipped to be making this complicated decision about his drug anti-signist management in the next 10 minutes because you were the nighttime doctor and I was like yeah that was my thought exactly and then we kind of had a discussion about this and she explained that okay so maybe what you're going to have to do is just kind of explain to the patient nicely that you're very sorry that you can't change his medication and you hope that you know the team in the morning will be able to help with that so that's what I did I went into his room I sat down and I trying to you know did the whole communication skill thing and found out his concerns and found out that he was he was having difficulty sleeping and we ended up describing a sleeping tablet for him and gave him a little bit of morphine for the pain but ultimately explained to him that I can't be making a decision about what sort of anti-signist drug to give him because it's such a complex affair and you know there's just no hope of getting it right you know in 10 minutes at nighttime anyway so that was quite challenging so once I've handled all of that by this point it's about 8pm and I've got an hour left in my shift and at this point I don't really have any thing urgent that he needs doing I've got a few patients on my list so that every time I get bleached with a job I write it on my iPad Pro in an encrypted document without any patient identify with the information just like numbers and initials of like things that I need to do and I've got a list of things that I need to chase so at this point I feel quite hungry so I popped down to Costa I grab a cheeky latte and then I take a seat in the in the Cambridge Harklinic which is a really beautiful air condition really nice and a ward space where the cardiology doctor sometimes hang out and I find like a nice little chair locked into the computer and because the whole hospital is electronic I managed to find out the results of all the investigations that I had to do from this really nice room and then you know just got a few bleeps every now and then to prescribe painkillers to prescribe warfarin that was absolutely fine and then about three minutes so it was about 8.57 and three minutes before I was due to hand over to the nighttime team I've got a bleep from one of the nurses who was calling me to a patient because they had a fever they had a high heart rate they had a low blood pressure their respiratory rate was high and there's this is thing called the national early warning score the news which is kind of like a numerical way of very quickly assessing how sick someone is so let's say you have a heart rate of above 100 that would give you a few points in the score let's say you have a blood pressure below so a number you'd have a certain point in the score so this guy had a news score of 12 which is really really high and effectively the higher the score is the more worried you should be about the patient and this is something that's very good at they identify the calculate the new score and then if it's above a certain threshold they just call the doctor and say okay we've got a new score of 12 these are the parameters this is the temperature blood pressure this is the history can you please come and see the patient so I got to the patient actually the rapid response team was already there and that's something that quite a few hospitals have now there a team of experience like really experienced nurses and in terms of care doctors his job it is to kind of be on call for anyone who is acutely on well so the nurse had very kind of called the rapid response team and two of the rapid response nurses arrived and they were absolutely incredible they were just so calm under pressure the patients were the patient was deteriorating but they just got him straight under control it's like you know speaking in failure though fairly kind of quiet voices because it was nighttime and other patients were asleep but it's handled it's so calmly and I was just kind of standing there being like okay my what what can I do was looking on the computer and looking what the history of the patient was using my stethoscope to listen to the heart and lungs and listen to the heart and lungs didn't find out anything that was particularly useful but these rapid response guys really knew what they were doing and that was such an inspiring way of kind of seeing how they dealt with it because we have had the kind of seminars and classes and simulations and dealing with acutely on well patients but it's very different doing it in on a simulated patient versus doing it in real life and we have also had training from these rapid response nurses and like I think just kind of the more experienced we get with this the better it will be at doing it so it was really nice having them there is kind of a backup but they ended up being less of a backup and I was more of the backup they were doing stuff and explaining stuff they went along and being really nice to me and it was great like that I think they could tell that this was my first time kind of doing a night shift of dealing with an acutely on a well patient and they just handled absolutely perfectly so yeah absolutely loved the rapid response team so that was what the night was like and then it was time to hand over after this patient was stabilised it was time to hand over to to the night team and when I got to the the board room when this hand over happens I found out actually that the guy was handing over to the guy that was in my college at Cambridge like three years older than me and he supervised some of my friends so we got to know each other he's into photography as well so we got a chatting a bit about the new Sony A73 camera handed over to patients that needed checking up find out that one of the other doctors who was taking over from one of the other f1s was again medical student at Emmanuel College Cambridge who supervised me in euro when I was in second year she was like two three years above so it was like really nice like it was it was almost like a little sort of family reunion and they're like oh hello this person hello that person like I reckon as you know you are then it means like a little bit of chitchat and that was just like a really nice and very nice end to the day seeing these guys and kind of realising that oh these guys are actual doctors now the cool medical trainees they know what they're doing they're taking over from me which is like really pleasant experience so overall first day doing like a twilight shift 13 hours it didn't really feel like that you know is because when you're doing stuff the time just absolutely flies you're doing a discharge summary and you've got another job you've got a leap coming in and then next thing you know like three hours of fasting and that oh wow it's like lunchtime ready and then after lunch there's like stuff to do and you're like oh wow it's 6pm already and then even on this relationship when I was dealing with all these bleeps that were coming through every now and then writing them in my little iPad like crossing them off when they were done the time just absolutely flew and there was never a moment where I was bored and that was that's always been my biggest worry with doing medicine is that you know this in the back of my head that what if I don't enjoy it and so far it's been a few days on the job I think I think I do enjoy it it's not it's always obviously not all kind of fun games it's not all roses there is as an F1 there is a lot of admin that you have to do there's a lot of writing this charge letters there's a lot of kind of dealing with paperwork electronic paperwork but even so I kind of realised today especially in this evening shift where I got to make some decisions that actually yeah I do sort of vaguely know what I'm doing and when I don't as was in the case of the acute urinal patient as was in the case of this anti-signus thing there are always other people you can contact for help either the rapid response team or your senior registrars or even the consultants there's this kind of chain of command that if you don't know what to do as soon as you get stuck you just escalated that's a really nice kind of safety net that's in place for the patients and also for us so really good day this has been a very roundy video let me know what you think of the format if you're still watching then thank you very much for watching I hope you liked the video
