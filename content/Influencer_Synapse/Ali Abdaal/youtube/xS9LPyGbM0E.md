# A&E Night Shift - Cambridge University medical student VLOG #16
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS9LPyGbM0E
Towards the end of this video, I talk about a patient who died that evening. The team tried resuscitation, but were sadly unsuccessful. 

Most of my videos about 'life as a medical student' paint quite a positive, almost airbrushed picture of what it's like.

However, given the number of medicine applicants who seem to be watching these videos, it seems unfair to only offer the rose-tinted view. 

As such, I won't be shying away from the heavier issues like death and dying that we, as medical professionals, are immensely privileged to be a part of. I hope to be able to talk about them in a sensitive manner, and hope that you'll see these segments in an educational and reflective light.

CLOSING THOUGHTS - 

Being part of the team that evening was a privilege that I'll never forget.

Our patient got the best possible care, but sadly, wasn't able to be resuscitated.

Death is an unavoidable part of being a doctor (and indeed, of being human). But too often, we're afraid of it, reluctant to talk about it with patients and families. 

I'm sure, over the course of my career, I'll meet many more patients who will die. I hope to learn from each, and to share some of that experience with you. 

My thoughts and prayers are with our patient and her family. May she rest in peace.

## Transcript
 Alright guys, it's the first night shift ever, and we're coming into the hospital at like 9.30 p.m. Now it's just darkened 10 p.m. so we're going to chill in the mess and then headed to A&E and see what happens. Obviously I can't film any actual patients because that's what legit but I hope I might be able to find a quiet moment in between patients who talk about what I've seen. Alright, so we are 4.5 hours into the night shift. It's about 2.30 in the morning and I've seen four patients, mostly by myself. So what I did was I brought them in from the waiting room, took the history, did an examination, and then presented the case to one of the doctors, and then the doctor saw the patient and just made sure everything was legit. So I saw a guy with chest pain, it sounded muscular skeletal, but obviously any time someone comes into the emergency department, with chest pain, you're worried about some kind of cardiac cause. So that was just about taking a history trying to rule out all of the sinister things. Like, you know, heart attack or pulmonary embolism or other bad things that can cause chest pain. If someone does come in with chest pain, they get what's called a proponent blood test. So this guy had a proponent because a rise in proponent equals probably a myocardial infarction, which is obviously a bad thing. There was another lady who would come in with some kind of like pain around the face, which was probably going to be a dental abscess. I thought it was sinusitis, but then the doctor said that he looked in the mouth and see that they've got like missing teeth or bad teeth. That's probably a dental abscess, so we referred her to the dentist. Then there was this other patient who just came in like super confused and didn't really know what was going on. Probably secondary to some kind of chest infection or water infection, though I took a history from him. That was a bit tricky because he didn't really know what was going on. He was a bit disorientated in time, place and person. And then finally there was a patient who would come in having had a seizure. So that was quite an interesting history to take. Anytime you're talking to someone who's had a seizure, you've got to find out what happened before, what happened during, what happened afterwards. And it was lucky that this person had someone with them at the time who witnessed the seizure. So that was quite good in terms of really kind of honing down on the questions that you're asking in a seizure history. And then we ended up sending them home because in A&E, you can't really do much about a seizure. They're going to get referred to neurology and the neurologists will take things from there. So overall, we're about halfway through the shift. It's been quite fun. The nurses have been super nice. The doctors have been super nice. It seems like quite a nice, quite nice atmosphere, especially at night time. There's not many patients around. There's not many staff around. And it feels quite camaraderie like. So I'm really enjoying it so far, stopping off in the mess for a 10 minute coffee break. And then I'm going to get back in there for another 5 hours or so of a nice shift in A&E, see you in a bit. A lady came in into recess from the ambulance. And by the time she got in, she was very pale. It wasn't as barely conscious. We got her into recess, started putting cannulars in her. And then her hardstock beating. So we put out the arrest call, loads of people part into the room. I managed to put a cannula, which was then used to give fluids. But then I very much took a vaccine as the whole machinery of the recess team kicked in. The anesthetist was there managing the airway. There were loads of people bringing drugs, gathering fluids, putting fluids. We even started CPR. So we did two rounds of CPR. There was a return, just spontaneous circulation. IE, the patient got a pulse back. Apparently, it's fairly common for cardiac respiration to rally. That's where the body just throws everything into this lost edge effort for survival. She had a pulse for a while. And they were injecting adrenaline, injecting loads of things, doing loads of blood gases. And seeing the results go more and more. But she was becoming more and more acedotic. Her lactate was going up through the roof. The hemoglobin was going down. She was reliant on the adrenaline to maintain circulation. And eventually the team decided unanimously that actually, even if, by some miracle, we could get the circulation back. She would probably have permanent brain damage. So time of death was called. And I'm not really sure how to feel about it. But I'm sure when I get home at some point they'll hit me. I suppose that's part of being a hospital. You
