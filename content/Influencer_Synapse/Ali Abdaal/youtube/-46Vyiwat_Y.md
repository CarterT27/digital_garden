## Transcript
 Hey guys, welcome back to the channel. If you're new here at my name is Ali, I'm a junior doctor working in Cambridge and in this video I'm going to share with you the essay memorization framework that I used when I was in my third year at Cambridge University. That was the year in which I was studying psychology and I actually ended up winning the prize for best exam performance in the year group and I pretty much exclusively attribute that to this essay memorization framework. This method should work for most essay based subjects but even if your subject isn't essay based, I hope you might still find this video useful and pick up a few tips and techniques along the way and of course everything I'm going to mention is going to be linked in timestamps in the video description and in a pinned comment so you can skip around the video if you feel like it. Let's just jump into it. So there are basically two stages to this method. The first stage is the creation stage and the second stage is the memorization stage. So in the creation stage the objective is to create first class essay plans for every conceivable essay title that they could throw it us in the exam and in the memorization stage we're going to be committing all of these essay plans to memory by systematically using active recall space repetition, spider diagrams and flashcards. The idea is that by the time the exam rules around you'll have memorized so many essay plans that a lot of them will just come up in the exam anyway because you've predicted the titles and you'll just be able to regurgitate stuff from your brain onto the paper but even if stuff comes up that you haven't memorized you'll know so much about the subject and you'll have so many content blocks in your head that you'll be able to generate a first class essay from scratch. So that was a general overview. Let's now talk about the two components the creation stage and the memorization stage in turn. So the broad objective of the creation stage is to create a large number of really really good essay plans that you can then memorize in the memorization stage and regurgitate onto paper during your exam. Now it's probably beyond the scope of this video for me to teach you how to write a good essay and probably also be on the scope of my own expertise but I will share some tips on three main questions and that's firstly how you decide what essay titles to pick. Secondly how you plan the essay and thirdly how you make sure your essay plan is really really good so let's deal with those in turn. So firstly how do we decide what essay is we're going to prepare? The objective here is to scope the subject and find essay titles that cover the entire breadth of the syllabus. Now the easiest way to do this is to look at past papers and look at whatever past papers you have available and see what essays have come up in the past and you start off with those and then once you've planned out those essays you'll know enough about that subject in particular that you'll be able to put yourself in the shoes of examiners and start thinking okay what's a good essay title that I've not yet asked about. If you haven't got past papers available then I'm very sorry to hear that you're just going to have to put yourself into the examiners shoes from the get go or you can actually go to your teacher or your professor or your lecturer or whatever and say hey what's the sort of essays that might come up in the exam? What are some things that are things that should be thinking about? So having made a list of what essays we're going to plan we then need to actually plan those essays and this is the fun part this is the part that actually requires doing some doing some cognitive labor. So the way I would do this is that I'd give myself one day per essay plan. So in the first time of uni I was a slacker I only made like five essay plans in the second term I made about 10 and then in the Easter holidays I've really ramped it up and made about 35 different ones and the way I do it is that I'd start off with a question so for example do animals have a theory of mind and then I would use Google to get as much information as I can about that particular question. I would ignore the lecture notes initially and I would ignore the recommended reading. I'd start off with Google because Google was like a really good way to find the answer to any question that you want and often I'd be linked to review articles and review papers and I'd be reading through those review papers. Oftentimes the review paper would directly answer the question in which case I've pretty much got my essay I just need to turn it into my own words but a lot of the time I'd be following references from the review paper and then once I'd created my essay plan I would then look at the lecture notes and the recommended reading and this meant that a lot of my material was hopefully more original than everyone else is because most of the students would have built their essays based around the lecture notes whereas I was building my essays on a random Google search. So I would start off by creating a research document on that particular topic and pretty much copy and paste every relevant bit of every paper I could find so this is my 10 page document about theory of mind. I've copied and pasted various bits and refraised various bits and you know rare random I don't even know any of this anymore. This is and you know included links at the bottom to where I got the information from so if I need to return to it I'll be able to find it again and then once I've got my research document I spent the next few hours planning out the essay and actually writing it out properly so here is my plan is theory of mind a useful concept for understanding social cognition in animals and yeah I've got an intro I've got a preamble I've got subheadings I've got evidence and I've basically taken all of this from these various different resources from books from the review papers from the lecture notes from Google and I've consolidated them into this one essay that I'm ultimately going to memorize and as you can see over here I've pretty much done this for everything within my subject so this is section B comparative cognition which is all about the thinking of animals can animals plan for the future causality cognitive maps the convergent evolution theory of intelligence animals have a theory of mind is a theory of mind useful concept and you can see here I've written an key beside them which is a foreshadowing as to what's going to come later in this video. So now we've done a research document we plan this essay we pretty much written it out based on our research document and we've only given ourselves one day to do this because of Parkinson's law that work expands to fill the time we allocate to it but how do we make the essay plan actually good um a lot of things going to good essay plan but in my opinion um there are three things that count number one structure number two actually answering the question and number three having a bit of flare a bit of spice that you have sprinkling in your essay plan and I think the introduction is the most important part of the essay because in the introduction you can signal to the examiner that you're doing all three of these things and when the examiner is marking your paper they're probably really bored they've read hundreds of these scripts already you want to hit them with like a really legit introduction so here's an example of an introduction from one of my essays about whether judgment and decision making is cognitive, ideological or affective i.e. emotional so ever in that the historical view in the social sciences has always been that judgments are based solely on content information with individuals being assumed to form judgments by systematically evaluating all available content information in an unbiased manner oh my god however over the past three decades a considerable amount of research is challenges assumption by showing that judgments may be formed not only on the basis of content information cognitive judgments but also on the basis of feelings affective judgment it is now well accepted that judgment can be both affective and cognitive and here's whether good stuff comes whether it is one or the other depends on a multitude of factors number one the salience of the effective feelings number two the representativeness of the effective feelings for the target number three the relevance of the feelings to the judgment number four the evaluative maliability of the judgment and number five the level of processing intensity and here is the ultimate clinch of this I will discuss these in turn and ultimately argue that generally speaking in day-to-day life the circumstances are generally those that result in effective rather than cognitive judgments and decision making so if we can disentangle all the verbosity from that paragraph what I've done is I've laid out the five main bits of the essay in terms of structure and I've used numbered points for that rather than just the list because numbered makes it really really obvious to the examineer that I've got a good structure I've also said exactly what the answer to the question is the question is asking whether our judgments are cognitive ideological or effective emotional and instead of wishing rushing around it I have said in this essay I will argue that they are emotional rather than cognitive in most elements of day-to-day life so I'm telling the examiner look I'm answering the question this is what you're going to get from me and finally I have had a little bit of flare hopefully with this stuff about the historical context I've probably got that from a textbook from a review paper somewhere and I've probably phrased into my notes and obviously this is just my plan so in the exam I won't quite be using it word for word so it's absolutely not plagiarism it's using you know useful resources to create a bit of flare but adding a bit of historical context so hopefully this introduction covers all three points structure answering the question and a bit of flare now I'm going to leave it at that for this section of the video obviously you know there are entire university courses and entire books and and stuff devoted to the art of writing a good essay I don't personally think I'm very good at writing an essay but I think I'm pretty good at using Google effectively and copying and pasting stuff into a research word document and then turning it into fairly legit sounding prose and then I think I'm pretty good at systematically memorizing all that information so if you want to know more about how to write an essay how I write an essay then let me know in the comments and I'll maybe try and do a video on it if I can kind of break down the process a bit further but now let's talk about stage two of the process the memorization stage okay so by this point we've got a load of really good essay plans that we have created in word documents now the objective in the memorization stage is to upload all of those essay plans to our brain so that we can then re-go to take them in the exam and we're going to do this using three main techniques number one and key flashcards number two spider diagrams and number three a retrospective revision timetable so again let's talk about these in turn so firstly and key and I've basically used anky flashcards to memorize every paragraph in every essay plan and this might seem a bit overkill but it worked for me um so what I've done is as you can see I've got keywords on the front of the card like bower in 1984 or damage at all 2006 or LS at all 1997 or short and versus long-term memory introduction I've even put the introduction into an anky flashcard and then over time I'll memorize these because pretty much anything that goes into my anky flashcards because during the exam term I'm going through my flashcards every single day and I'm doing anky's space repetition algorithm I just know that anything that that's in my anky is just going to get uploaded to my brain with a small amount of effort put in by me to actually actually memorize this stuff so yeah I've got I've got the keywords and I've got the content so basically if I've put you know a paper Russell and fair in 1987 I'm describing in the anky flashcard what that paper shows which means that overall I've create I create these blocks of content that every anky flashcard is his only a block and that block can slot into my essay that I've planned but also if a weird essay comes up that I haven't explicitly planned I still have all these blocks of knowledge in my head and that means if there is a paper that's relevant I'll know what it is I'll know what the references I'll know what the content is I'll know how I know how to describe the experiment and I'll just be able to put it into even new essays that I'm writing on the spot in the exam so that's all well and good but obviously knowing a Tversky and Connemann experiment from 1974 or Massiviler and Strak from 2000 those things aren't that helpful unless you can also associate them with their own essays and that's where the spider diagrams come in all right so the second prong of the memorization stage of the essay memorization framework involves spider diagrams and this is the book that I've made almost by the diagrams in so having memorized a ton of content blocks from my essays using anky flashcards what I've now done is from the 20th of April onwards I made spider diagrams one page diagrams of every single essay so here's the first one about implicit versus explicit memory we've done various topics of the memory cognitive maps metapook metacognition and the idea is that we pretty much got the whole structure of the essay along with the keywords in the spider diagram so this is the essay about short-term memory versus long-term memory it starts off with an introduction then something about single system memory then something about the two components and if we zoom in over here we see I've written g plus c 1966 and that actually refers to the flashcard of a here where I talk about a glanzer and kunnets 1966 and in my flashcard I've got the content block where I'm describing the experiment and actually this is just like a whole paragraph and other g and c experiment this g 1972 is a glanzer 1972 crake 1972 b and h is badly and someone else I think I've badly and hitch yeah 1977 so I have all these content blocks in anky and I've just put the keywords onto the spider diagram so that when I'm creating the spider diagram and I write g plus c 1966 I know exactly what that refers to obviously I've now forgotten four years later but I used to know exactly what that referred to back in the day and I've done this for every single one of the 40 50 essays that I've memorized and the way this would work is that every day I would just draw out various spider diagrams from memory so on the 20th of April as we can see over here I did implicit explicit recollection for minority semantic episodic short-term long-term memory then on the 21st I did future planning I did theory of mind of the theory of mind use for usefulness metacognition come with maths gosh personality genes black and white differences in iQ intelligence controversial subject the flin effect explanation multiple intelligent wow I was clearly very productive on the 21st of April 2015 but the point is that every single day I'd be drawing out these spider diagrams from memory and if there were any bits that I didn't know or that was shaky on I would look up on my master spider diagram or in my master essay planner and and I'd actively work on those so over time this ended up being like a really effective way to systematically use active recall to ensure that I knew absolutely everything and like in the time before the exam I was just bashing through these so you know 8th of May we've done this one we've done this one we've done that one another one another one another one another one another one another one I think this is one of the 8th of May another one I wow yeah this was like about a week before our exams and on the 8th of May I've just absolutely bashed through and planned about but you know I'm just like drawing out my plans for about 15 different essays so we've got a content blocks in anky we've memorized them using anky we've got our kind of essay structures using spider diagrams we've memorized them using active recall the final piece of the puzzle involves systematic space repetition so how did I decide what I was going to do each day if you've seen any of my revision videos you might have come across the idea of the retrospective revision time table and that was what I used I've made a whole video on this I'm not going to talk about it in basically it actually I'm just going to show you over here where are we now here we go this was my retrospective revision time table so it's split up into section any section B and section C so let's see implicit versus explicit memory oh here we go this actually works so on the 20th of April I studied implicit versus explicit memory so I've mocked down the date as the 20th of April and then I've mocked down all the various things that are the 20th of April and then I think on the 21st I did some of B and C yep so you can see on the 21st of April when I active recalled these essay plans over here wherever they are I've marked them in the retrospective sheet and then the idea is that the next time I do them I am marking the date for that and then I'm colour coding it in red yellow green whatever depending on how well I knew it at the time so I've done this for all the essays that I memorized and I've done it for all of my subjects within psychology so there's much more detail in the video specifically by the retrospective revision time table where I explain exactly how it works how I'd recommend using it and why I think it's better than a standard prospective revision time table but yeah that is the third prong of the memorization stage of the essay memorization framework so that was an overview of the essay memorization frameworks that I used to systematically memorize about 45 to 50 different essay plans using a mixture of active recall spatial petitions, flashcards and spider diagrams and that ended up going quite well for me in the actual exam I think about two thirds of the essay titles out of the I think 12 essays we had to write I think eight of them were essays that were part of my block of 50 I like I don't I don't really plan them so it was pretty pretty easy enough to just regurgitate what I already knew onto the page which was awesome but then about a third of them about four of the essays one new they'd never been asked before I hadn't predicted them but because I knew so much about the subjects like you know at that time if you'd asked me any question at all about you know the animal psychology or if you'd asked me any question at all about IQ or intelligence or personality or shorter memory long-term memory or I don't know judgment decision making I knew so much about those subjects based on memorizing all these essays that it was pretty straightforward to build an essay from scratch in about 10 minutes in the exam so I would just plan it out using the spider diagram and then regurgitate using my own content blocks from my Ankey flashcards but also just being able to write whatever I wanted because I knew the subject so well so the method ended up working recently well for me um me and another student we wanted to join award for best exam performance I later emailed my supervisor and he actually said that she beat me by a few like you know decimals of a percentage point um but because the two of us were so far ahead of everyone else they decided very kindly to jointly award as the prize for best exam performance so technically I didn't come first actually came second but that would make for a less clickbait title so apologies for that if I've misled you thus far anyway I hope you found this video useful and take something away from it um this method worked really really well for me and I kind of wish I'd been more systematic about my revision in this way um in subsequent years but after peaking in third year I decided that I wanted to do other things ended up kind of reverting to inefficient habits like rereading and highlighting and stuff in my fourth fifth and sixth year but still you know having this stuff in the back of my mind meant that I was able to use my retrospective revision timetable to efficiently get pretty reasonable marks in the exams while also sustaining a side career of running a business and running a YouTube channel which I don't think I'd have been able to do if I hadn't been efficient with my studying and which is why you know all these tips you know it's it's useful to use efficient study tips because if you want you can put in loads of time and get really really good marks but if you want to do other stuff on the side it means you have the time to do other stuff on the side so that worked really well for me so thank you so much for watching I really hope you got something useful out of this video if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment down below and I will reply to the comments but I'll also put a link in the description to a page about this thing on my website where I will put all of the commonly asked questions and answers that are able to expand more in depth so if you do have specific questions about this method have a look at the comments have a look at my website because it's probably easier to read the answers there directly rather than trolling through YouTube comments and I don't know people are going to troll me for using a clickbait title but yeah anyway I hope you found this video useful if you liked it please give it a thumbs up if you like you can follow me on Instagram I post photos and videos and stuff behind the scenes of how I make these videos and what life as a doctor in the UK is like my brother and I have also recently started a new podcast it's called Not Over Thinking and that's where we overthink about topics in daily life like happiness creativity and the human condition that's a tagline you can find that and not overthinking.com and if you haven't subscribed to the channel then could you consider doing so I make videos about life as a doctor but also about studying videos like this and also about tech reviews and productivity and a bit music here and there so thanks so much for watching have a good night and I'll see you in the next video. Bye bye
