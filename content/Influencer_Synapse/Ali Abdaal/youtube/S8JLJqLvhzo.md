## Transcript
 Hey guys, welcome back to the channel. If you're new here, my name is Aliya. I'm a junior doctor working in Cambridge and in this video I'm gonna be answering the age-old question of whether an iPad pro is better for reading or whether an Amazon Kindle is the one that you should go for This is a question that has been plaguing for those first for thousands of years, but I'm hoping to answer it for you as quickly as possible in this very short video So basically the answer is I would recommend a Kindle for reading most things a Kindle is absolutely amazing because it looks like you're actually reading on paper So this is the book bad blood. It's about Theranos that blood testing startup that turned out to be a bunch of lies But it's a sort of book that I'm gonna be reading cover to cover It's a sort of book I would read from start to finish and therefore reading it on a Kindle is absolutely perfect because it looks like real paper It feels like reading an actual book and I've been using the Kindle to read about 99% of the books I've read for the last like 10 plus years the the only thing an iPad is good for in my opinion when it comes to reading is For things like medical textbooks where you want to be able to kind of scan it from page to page You want to be able to flick around you want to be able to grab your apple pencil and maybe Annate some bits and bobs on your iPad that's a sort of thing that is just completely impossible to do with a Kindle So if this sort of reading you're gonna be doing involves actually reading cover to cover 100% you could get a Kindle even if you have an iPad It's just a far better experience reading on a Kindle because it looks like real paper You can read it in bed. It doesn't strain your eyes the new Kindles of waterproof iPad is not waterproof The Kindle is cheap and light you can carry around wherever you go the iPad is not cheap It's kind of light. You can sort of carry around It's quite hard to use the iPad pro one-handed. You could use the iPad mini one-handed But fundamentally reading on an iPad feels like reading on a screen Whereas reading on a Kindle feels like reading on real paper that completely sells the Kindle for me like Yeah, like if you if you want a device for reading you have to go for the Kindle if you want a device for browsing through textbooks or PDFs or whatever Annotating them then the iPad is better. I'll use both extensively whenever I go on holiday I take both the Kindle and the iPad pro with me and people sometimes say oh, why are you carrying both devices? Can't you just use the Kindle app on your phone to read and yeah, you can but it's just so so nice Really gonna Kindle really want a phone feels like you know I'm just looking at my phone so I'd 100% recommend the Kindle in fact I've made a couple of videos about this the Kindle is probably the second most valuable purchase I've ever made in my life after the original camera that I bought which kickstart on my YouTube channel So I've been a Kindle fanboy since like 2008 or something like that and that's only gonna continue I've got hundreds of books on Kindle and I automatically assign them to my good reads account when I'm reading So I can keep track of everything I've read. I also have the Kindle app on the iPad and it's all right on the iPad I sometimes you know if I absolutely have to I would use the Kindle app to read on the iPad But it's just not as nice. It's like reading on a screen rather than reading on paper So yeah, that's that's pretty much it if you want to read then you should get a Kindle if you have an iPad But don't have a Kindle. I would still probably recommend you buy the Kindle because it's just for a far better experience If you have a Kindle shoot you get an iPad well, maybe but not for reading purposes If you want to get an iPad you should get an iPad for all the other reasons to get an iPad The iPad is not a device very well suited for reading things cup of tobacco It's amazing for all sorts of other things So that's pretty much it get the Kindle Kindle is amazing I'll put an affiliate link in the description below so if you buy it I'll make like 1% commission from Amazon for selling something from their website So yeah, thank you for watching this video If you liked it, please give it a thumbs up if you haven't subscribed to the channel yet, and please consider doing so have a lovely day And I'll see you in the next video. Bye bye
