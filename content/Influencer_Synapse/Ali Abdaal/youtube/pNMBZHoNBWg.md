## Transcript
 Oh hey friends welcome back to the channel as the video are going to be talking about 9 Life Lessons that I've learnt this week it's actually been an absolute bender of a week because I have recorded about 15 interviews for the deep dive podcast and I thought I'd separate those things out into 3 lessons in terms of work, 3 lessons from the realm of health and 3 lessons from the realm of relationships that I'm going to share in this little video. Right so the first life lesson is from someone called Francesca Spectre and it is the concept of a loan mint. Francesca has written a book during the pandemic which is all about how to spend time alone and I interviewed her about this yesterday and yesterday evening I had this a loan mint time in my calendar and the nice thing about this word that she's made up for this a loan mint rather than loneliness is that you know when you give a word when you give a name to a thing it makes you more intentional about the thing and makes you feel like the thing is more and so yesterday evening in my calendar I had a four hour block called a loan mint and I went to a restaurant by myself and it's some journaling and it was really nice. I think one thing that I do struggle with very much at first what problem but something that I do struggle with is actually spending time by myself. Normally if I have a free evening or something I'd sort of frantically message people to see who I can hang out with but now having this vocabulary of a loan mint and hearing some of the benefits of spending time alone the mental health benefits, psychological benefits etc etc makes me more keen to try it out. The other cool thing about a loan mint and having it as a block in the calendar is that it then became a thing that I was looking forward to for the rest of the day and essentially anticipation is completely free points of happiness like a lot of the value you get from a holiday is looking forward to the holiday and if you look forward to something it's just free happiness points. In case you're wondering we're actually in the process of moving house so today is a big day of packing anyway less than number two is in the health department and this was from when I was interviewing Matteo and Alex who are the co-founders of 8 sleep which is this $500 million sleep fitness company and we were talking a lot about what are the kind of what the 8020 of what you need to know to really optimise your sleep and one of the things unsurprisingly is sleeping and waking up at the same time every day regardless of whether it's the weekend or not and so they have this regimented thing where they're in bed by 1030 and they wake at 630 and so I asked them that okay hang on what's going on that like isn't that like incompatible with a social life what if you're out at dinner with friends and what they said was you know if we're having dinner with friends we'll do it 6pm or 630 and my mind was burned because it's such a simple thing and in my mind dinner with friends is like an 8pm thing and if you have dinner with friends at 8pm by the time you order it's nine by the time you finish just like 11 but time you get home it's midnight and then whenever that would happen and I have dinner with friends many times a week hashtag popular but whenever that would happen I would end up just missing out on sleep or waking up super late the next day and then the whole day is a bit annoying but I actually just could have dinner with friends 630pm and then we're done by like 839 so I can get home and be in bed for 1030 so I just thought that little change in perspective I did it with friends that does not have to be 8pm it can in fact be at 630 and speaking of sleep I'm absolutely delighted to say that this video is very kindly sponsored by Emma Emma makes the absolute best mattresses in the world I have been using an Emma mattress for about three years in my flat in Cambridge and so when we reached out to them to say thank you it was absolutely incredible that they offered to give us some free stuff for this house and to sponsor this video their products are absolutely fantastic they've got a 10 year warranty on absolutely everything along with free shipping and free returns and a 200 nit trial so you can literally try out any of their products for 200 days and if you don't like it you can return it completely for free and as we know sleep is just a ridiculously important part of life and later on in this video we're going to talk about the idea of sleep fitness which is another thing that I learned in this week of doing podcast interviews this pillow as well that I use is an Emma pillow and it's the most comfortable pillow I've ever used and I also ordered one of their do-based their king size duvet that this loop who thing is on microfiber it's great it's very comfortable anyway if you fancy leveling up your sleep as well you can head over to the Emma website which will be linked down below and if you use the coupon code Ali Dream at checkout you will get an extra 5% off on top of all of the other promotions that they have that's coupon code Ali Dream and thank you so much Emma for sponsoring this video and if you're helping me get a better night's sleep okay so um lesson number three that I'm taking away is something that I actually got from a bunch of different entrepreneurs so Alex Hormosie Daniel Priestley Tim Armo these guys like ridiculous is successful entrepreneurs who have had exits in the tens of millions of dollars of range and I asked a lot of them you know if you're interested in for example like let's say you have a normal job and you're interested in starting a business one day because maybe you want to get Rachel you want to have a certain type of impact what would be that the action that they recommend and all three of them said like unanimously that essentially taking some time to learn the skills of entrepreneurship and learn the skills of business is very useful thing if you're currently having a normal job and you want to potentially start a business one day then actually working for a small business or a startup for a year or two is a very very good thing the problem with having a corporate job is that you're a cognitive machine and you don't appreciate how the wider machine works but you know like for example in the UK there are like 5 million small businesses that have like less than 10 employees and so if you join one of those businesses almost whatever industry it's in you'll get the whole range of experience and you'll understand how sales and marketing and operations are financed and legal and HR you'll understand how all these things work anyway that was less than number three which is now how I'm going to respond to people when they ask me that question of like what should I do if I want to start a business? Alrighty so our next tip comes from my friend Cliff Weitzman the founder and CEO of speechify and we spent about half of our conversation talking about business and speed listening but the other half talking about being more intentional with relationships and one thing that Cliff does which is really great is that he makes it a point that anytime he thinks something nice of someone he will just like message them or voice note them the thing and I just think that's a great role to have in life um I like yeah I often think about people and then I'm often like in the middle of something and then I just don't don't think to tell them that I'm thinking of them or as what Cliff said is that you know that is a worthwhile ten seconds to take out of your day to just voice notes someone and it makes their day and just adds great vibes to the world. Alrighty so where are we item number five is a health rated thing and that is what I got from speaking to Jim Doty who's a professor of neurosurgery and Taurus Wart who is a neuroscientist and psychiatrist and we talked about the Paris sympathetic nervous system which is basically the sort of rest and recharge bit of the nervous system compared to the sympathetic nervous system which is the sort of fight flight freeze kind of mode and what Taurus says is that according to some studies done in America around 75% of US like office workers are in this sort of sympathetic state of nervous system activation for most of their workday which is quite a high stress high anxiety type situation but the way you can reset your nervous system is essentially by taking deep breaths and that's why you know this apple watch breathing thing where you just take a deep breath deep breath in and out for a minute that helps kind of reset your nervous system to abuse clinical phrases and tends to activate the Paris sympathetic and so you tend to feel less stressed by just doing that when you're at work. Alrighty so here we are we are in the new place and I've forgotten what I've sort of lost track of what lesson number we're on but hopefully it will appear over here and this is another work themed one because you know we had three relationships three health three work this is another work themed one and this is the idea of essentially leveling up your own ability to make a money. Now again we're speaking of the entrepreneurship stuff and in the previous example I talked about how these quite a coin here. Anyway in the previous example I talked about how these guys were all saying that if you want to learn how to do business then you want to start up for some amount of time but there was something when I was speaking to Alex Formozi as well and I really liked the way he put it he said that a lot of people make the mistake of trying to invest in the SNP and they should be investing in the SNP and so for example if you have a spare $200 or something to invest when you've got a real job or you're a student or something like that however much that money is instead of trying to get 7% returns in the SNP 500 which is going to maybe when you're 65 then you'll you know that it'll compound to a reasonable level instead of doing that what a lot of these guys are saying is that you should try your best to level up your own skills using that money like you can have a way higher return on that $200 if you invest it in training yourself and maybe taking a course on sales or marketing or finance or operations or camera confidence or one of my courses if you want but you know alternatively in your industry there might be some sort of certifications or courses or whatever that you can do which will increase your floor of earning capability and that generally pays way more dividend over the long term than investing in something like stocks and shares does. Now we asked somewhat fast forwarding a few days into the future because I don't quite have time to film the rest of this video on the day because I went to a Hassan Minhaj comedy concert with my mum but just want to round off the rest of this video with three more lessons at the first one comes from a chap called Daniel Priestley who's written an amazing series of books that I absolutely love the entrepreneur revolution and oversubscribed and he's got a new one called scorecard marketing and what I learned from Daniel is a new method of creating a minimum viable product. Now essentially the idea is that for anyone who has a business idea you want to try and create an MVP a minimum viable product so that you can test your business idea without having to sync loads of time and money into it and to mistake the people makers that they feel like if they have an idea for a business they have to then quit their jobs to work on the idea which is absolutely yes you don't need to do that at all but what you can do is create a minimum viable product and this is something that you can do on the side in the evenings or on the weekends and crucially there's two types of MVPs that you can do relatively easily. The first one is you can host some kind of zoom webinar. Now let's see you've got this idea for a service based business and let's say I don't know you're doing web design for private practice doctors or something like that because that's an industry that you have some level of familiarity with. Now it would be a total waste of time for you to go out and do all the things make the websites do the brochures all that kind of stuff because you don't know whether you're actually going to have any demand for your service. So essentially you can do one of two things which are fairly easy. The first one is you can host a free webinar or a free event of some description where you can be like hey this is an event where I'm going to teach you how a website can level up your private practice or level up your brand as a surgeon and then you see how many people can you get to rock up to this totally free webinar or totally free event and if you can get people to rock up to it now that's your lead generation which is sorted and now you know that okay there's at least some demand for the product that I'm going to make. Alternatively what you can do is create a scorecard of some sort and that's what Daniel's new book scorecard marketing talks about. Where you basically make a glorified quiz on Google forms or on score app or on any of these various different pieces of software and it might be something like hey do you need a website to market your private practice as a surgeon take take this quiz to find out and you can construct the quiz in a way that gives you loads of really valuable data and you can capture email addresses of people that do take the quiz but crucially your job is to then send traffic to that quiz somehow using your network using Facebook using social media using whatever because if you can't get people to fill out a free quiz then your business is probably going to fail and I think this method of kind of validating the idea for a service-based business is absolutely game-changing because now it's accessible for absolutely anyone to test out a business idea even while doing it on the weekend or while doing it in an evening it only takes a couple of hours to set one at the hour one of these things up you don't need to know how to learn to code you don't need to do any of that stuff but every business stems from lead generation and you have to be able to get leads for your business before you can do anything with them loads more about this in the episode that I'm going to release with Daniel Priestley in an upcoming season of my deep dive podcast so if you haven't subscribed you should check it out it's available in all podcast players and yet genuinely this has changed the way that I think about business moving forward all right next we have another lesson about sleep and this is one that I got from interviewing Alex and Mateo who are the founders of a sleep and that's just a concept of sleep fitness and I hadn't really come across this concept before that interview but it's definitely something I've been thinking about since then and it's the idea that just like you can have physical fitness and you can have a workout regime or a diet regime or something like that there is also the concept of sleep fitness that you can treat your sleep as something like fitness something that you can optimize and if for example you have a bad night sleep you know if you're in a row you don't manage to sleep appropriately on time or whatever the thing might be then you can treat that similarly to how you might treat if you don't workout for a week or two in that you can just get back on it and I think when it comes to sleep a mistake I've certainly made in the past is thinking oh my sleep schedule is really bad right now oh there's no point in trying to fix it let me just just sort of live with this and just not do anything about it but if for example I missed a few workouts I wouldn't just be thinking oh there's no point exercising ever again I would actually be like okay that's fine I've missed this two weeks I can I can just begin again and since coming across this idea of sleep fitness and listening to few episodes of the human and lab cod podcast where they talk much more about how to optimize your sleep there's just a lot of things that I've been really actively thinking about to make sure that I get a decent night sleep and one of the things that Alex and Mateo said is that you know sleeping appropriately is the absolute best performance enhancing drug that we know and it just takes a few simple tweaks for example sleeping at the same time every day ideally number two aiming to get roughly eight hours each every evening and number three aiming to sleep in a slightly cool cold temperature room roundabout kind of 19 degrees Celsius seems to be a reasonable average but your mileage may vary and really what I'm trying to do moving forward is treat my sleep as this thing that's very important and this thing that I'm going to actively optimize because of just all of the various performance benefits and life benefits that you get from having a decent night sleep and final lesson is also in the relationships camp and that is just the power of sending cold emails and cold DMs on social media apps like Twitter and Instagram and LinkedIn for example and again this is a tip that I got from Cliff and he talked about in you know in the podcast interview about how many friends he's made and how many contacts he's made purely by virtue of sending the appropriate cold email or cold message that's how he ended up hanging out with Mr. Beast it's how he ended up meeting a bunch of his heroes it's how he ended up meeting people who he then hired as part of his team it's how he ended up meeting his current girlfriend and I think when it comes to sending cold DMs and cold messages I always have this bit of hesitation around that you know what do I have to offer like why would why would they reply etc etc etc but anytime I've sent a cold email I've always been glad that I sent a cold email and it's a very positive expected value thing like worst case scenario they're not going to reply best hit best case scenario they do reply and you end up developing a relationship with this person that you've admired so that's certainly something that I'm taking forward and I'm trying to become more okay with sending cold DMs when I vibe with someone just to be like hey do you want to hop on a call or hey I happen to be in your area in the near future do you want to grab dinner or something anyway that brings us to the end of this somewhat rambly nine lessons that I learned in this week of recording about 15 different podcast interviews if you like this you might have to check out this video over here which is 27 life lessons from 27 years on this earth in about 27 minutes so if you like these all to list of calls you might like to check that out thank you so much for watching and I'll see you hopefully in the next video bye
