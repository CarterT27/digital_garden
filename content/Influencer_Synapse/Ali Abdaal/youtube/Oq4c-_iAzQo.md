## Transcript
 Right so sleep is pretty weird. Evolutionarily sleep is a ridiculously stupid thing because we're out cold for 8 hours where any predator could come and kill us while we're completely defenseless. But for some reason God Slash Evolution is decided that these risks are totally worth it and that the benefits of sleep are outweighed being blind and defenseless for a third of our lives. So clearly sleep is important but I never really given much thought about how to sleep better and more productively until I read Matthew Walker's fantastic book Why We Sleep. And so in this episode of Book Club we're going to talk through the key lessons from the book Why We Sleep and if you stick around till the end of the video you will hear the 12 quick evidence based tips on how to sleep better that you can start applying to your life immediately let's go. Section 1 Why We Should Sleep Better. So before we talk about how to actually sleep productively we need to be sold on why sleeping better is actually important. Firstly one of the key points is that we all actually kind of need more sleep. There is apparently this epidemic of like you know people not sleeping 8 hours a day and there's all this stuff around. Oh I'll sleep when I'm dead and I only need 6 hours of sleep every night to function perfectly fine. But as our friend Matthew talks about in the book there is a ton of evidence allegedly that shows that if you sleep chronically sleep for less than 8 hours a day you are scaring yourself in various domains of life. Yes apparently there are people who can sleep for less than 6 hours each night and function completely fine without any issues but those are less than 1% of the population and so if you think you're in that camp I certainly am not we are probably not in that 1%. Secondly even if we do feel that we're all right when we get 6 hours or 7 hours of sleep apparently the evidence shows that we are pretty bad at assessing our own performance and function while we're sleep deprived. And so we're sleep deprived but we think oh I'm totally fine. It's like when you're hot broken but you think oh I'm totally fine but you're actually not deep down it's the same thing with sleep. So that's why we should sleep for 8 hours a day but if we don't sleep for 8 hours a day we can get all sorts of issues further down the line. For example Matthew says in the book that routinely sleeping less than 6 or 7 hours a night demolishes your immune system more than doubling your risk of cancer and he talked about how sleep deprivation is associated with other very bad things including general high immortality, heart disease, weight gain, infection rate and even Alzheimer's disease. Secondly if we get less than 8 hours a day of sleep repeatedly apparently that also reduces our performance. Lowers are productivity or social fluidity or rational decision making memory recall emotional control and even artist-tosterone levels lol. In fact he says that after 10 days of just 7 hours of sleep the brain is as dysfunctional as it would be after going without sleep for 24 hours. So imagine what it feels how grim it feels to not save 24 hours like that is what we're like if we sleep for 7-7 hours, 10 days in a row. There's also those evidence about how lack of sleep is associated with reduced creativity in various forms and as an aside I want to link in the video description to a blog post written by this chap called Alexey Goosey which actually apparently shows that Matthew Walker's book why we sleep is riddled with scientific errors and inaccuracies and stuff. Interesting blog post. I suggest reading the book or reading a summary of the book and then reading the blog post and then you can see like what kind of issues he's taking with all the evidence in the book but I mean it's a best seller. It's doing very well. I feel like my life is improved when I follow the advice in the book while we sleep and so even if some of it might not be entirely legit according to this Alexey Goosey guy I still think it's pretty much worth following and if you're interested in finding out what Matthew says in the book but you can't be bothered to actually read the book or you've read the book and you want a quick summary. 100% I would recommend using shortform shortform.com and we've got an affiliate link in the video description the not sponsoring the video but it's genuinely my favorite way of all time to read summaries of books and so I read this properly once and then when I need to revisit the issues from it or the points from it I just read the short from summary because they're short from summaries really good they have a fantastic like one page of basically the whole book in one page and then they break down each chapter and just give you the core salient points and it's also kind of cool because they cross reference it with other books in the short from library so you can see oh Matthew Walker makes this point here and that's similar to a point that Ryan Hollow makes in this book over here well things like that which is all kind of cool if you like that kind of thing hit the link in the video description it's an affiliate link so I get a little bit of a kick back but no they're not paying me to say this they're not sponsoring this video like genuinely 100% solid recommendation you should definitely check it out section two how can we sleep better let's now talk about the 12 practical things we can do right now to make ourselves sleep better immediately remember one set a sleep schedule and try and sleep and wake up at the same time every day don't sleep procrastinate this is something I do a lot trying to get better at it and don't think that if that if it's a weekend you should be able to sleep in because that makes it even harder to wake up on a Monday morning and if you have like a job that you don't like it makes Monday mornings even more grim secondly don't use alarms if you can help it alarms apparently cause a huge stress response when we wake and we can all relate to that feeling of the annoying iPhone alarm and like the worst sound in the world that apparently actually has a measurable increase in our stress levels and even worse if we snooze our alarms we get that repeated stress trauma every single morning rule three wake up with the sun or use very bright lights this helps set our circadian rhythm and helps tell our body clock our internal body clock that oh it's the daytime therefore I'm gonna be awake rule four avoid all caffeine and nicotine completely if it all possible but if you have to have caffeine like I do like I cannot wake up in the morning without caffeine then we should stop having at least 10 hours before sleeping and so I have a rule for myself that I'm not allowed to have caffeine after 2pm because I know it's gonna affect sometimes I still have it sometimes I have a diet coke with caffeine in it in the evening so the McDonald's drive through and I always regret it afterwards because then I always struggle to get to sleep rule five exercise regularly because exercise regularly helps with our sleep and it's just generally good for us but we generally want to avoid exercising within three hours of the time that we're gonna go to bed rule six don't nap after 3pm. Naps are pretty good for us but if we nap after 3pm it makes it apparently harder to sleep properly at night I'm not much of a nap for myself but it's something I'm gonna start experimenting with in the near future so we'll see how that goes. Rule seven don't drink alcohol until it's completely metabolized by the time you sleep. Apparently alcohol is one of the most powerful suppressors of REM rapid eye movement sleep which is like one of the important aspect of sleep and if you have it any reasonable amount of time before bed it's definitely gonna affect your sleep and there's a nice quote here where he says the politically incorrect advice I would of course never give is this. Go to the pub for a drink in the morning that way the alcohol will be out of your system before sleep and then he's like lol I was kind of joking slash not joking but he says that nightly alcohol will disrupt your sleep and the annoying advice of abstinence is the best and most honest I can offer. Basically what he's saying is don't drink alcohol at all I don't drink alcohol at all I think it's great plenty of health reasons for not drinking alcohol one of which is that it's absolutely terrible for us sleep. Rule number eight avoid large meals and drinks at night. If we eat a large meal before sleeping it does make us feel slightly sea-pierced sleep here but apparently it does affect the quality of our sleep and so generally the advice is that the biggest meal of the day should be lunch and then dinner should be a less like drench meal because you know if we want our sleep to be good which means that sadly my McDonald's drive through takeaways at 12 o'clock midnight are probably not a good idea. Rule number nine reduce lights before sleep. Blue light in particular is the most harmful and so what I've got is Philip's Hugh Lightlobs around the living room and I set all the lights to have this warm yellow glow to avoid the blue light at night time. I still don't do this fully properly because I still have like blue lights from like my devices and phone and stuff and I use apps like flux and a night shift to help reduce the blue light but even so it's not completely ideal and instead of using devices he says that a relaxing activity such as reading or listening to music should be part of your bedtime ritual isn't that cute. Rule number ten cool your body temperature before sleeping the ideal temperature for sleeping is 65 degrees Fahrenheit which is 18.3 degrees Celsius which is actually pretty cold and so these days when I sleep I literally have a fan and the open window to try and get the temperature down to that 18 degrees number and whenever I'm in a hotel or something I always set the air conditioning like way down to 18 degrees and it makes a room feel very cold but then when you're in bed like pajamas or scrubs like I sleep in it's like a little blanket. It does feel very nice and I like anecdotally I find that my sleep is much better when I'm in a cold room than when I'm in a slightly warmer room and if I'm in a really warm room there's just no way I can sleep in those conditions. Rule number eleven don't rely on sleeping pills those are generally bad and they don't really help with our sleep instead they put us into a state of sedation which isn't the same as sleep and so we don't get the benefits of sleep itself if we're using sleeping pills a lot and finally rule number ten is don't lie in bed awake trying to fall asleep for more than 20 minutes and this is something that I used to struggle with a lot before I started taking care of my sleep or I'd be lying awake in bed for absolutely ages like oh why am I not sleeping and what he says in the book is that when we're in that mode of trying to talk ourselves into sleeping that is actually increasing our stress and anxiety levels which paradoxically makes it even harder to fall asleep instead he says that if you're struggling to fall asleep and if you haven't been able to for more than 20 minutes then just get up out of bed and do something do an activity or something or other until you feel sleepy the way I've interpreted this advice it maybe isn't entirely legit if that would just be read in bed until I feel my eyes literally start to close and then I will drop the candle onto the floor take off my glasses chuck him across the room and then just hit the sack and I've never found that to not be effective in sleeping unless I've been reading a particularly fantastic book by like Brandon Sanderson or something has been keeping me up until four o'clock in the morning because it's just that good so that was an overview of Matthew Walker's book while we sleep you should definitely check out the short form book summary along with these other books that they've got summaries of on short form does a really good link in the video description and if you want to hear my personal take on the book and how I incorporate the advice check out this video over here which says why I'm never tired which is a slightly click-baity title but it's actually kind of true and people have been finding that video pretty helpful thank you so much for watching have a great day and I'll see you in the next video bye bye
