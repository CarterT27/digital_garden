## Transcript
 Hey friends, welcome back to the channel. Today we're doing something a little bit different than usual and I'm going to be taking you through the 10 levels of being able to play the piano and sing at the same time. So you can go from a total beginner to being able to sing something like this. If we go perfect by Ed Sheeran, it goes something like this. Listen to our favorite song and so on and this is all just me not really knowing how to play the piano but just following a series of mathematical formulas across these 10 different levels which I'm going to teach you in this video and whenever I post something like this on my Instagram story by the way please follow me on Instagram. People always ask me that how long have you been taking piano lessons for and like where did you learn and how did you learn and all this stuff and I think when it comes to playing piano especially playing piano and singing and stuff it can sound and it looks a lot more intimidating and difficult than it actually is and as as I'll hopefully show you in this video by just following a few formally and by using a cool website and by doing a little bit of practice you too can get to the point where people will think that you've been playing the piano for years because you're playing the piano and singing at the same time. Let's get into it. Alright let's get started with level one and that is where we're going to go on a website called Ultimate Guitar Tabs and we're going to type in the name of the song we want to do for example perfect by Ed Sheeran and we're going to find a series of chords that have a decent rating so this one has 33,000 reviews which is pretty good we're going to click on that and now this will tell you the exact chords of the song that you want to play and that is basically what we're going to be what we're going to be using. The main thing as well is that for the purposes of this video we're going to be playing in the key of C major don't worry if you don't don't know what that means but basically you want to use the Transpose button on this website and make it so the first the first note is a C so I'm going to go all the way down now my first note is a C and that means the only notes I'm allowed to play for the rest of the song are the white notes stuff about keys and you know different majors and miners and all that kind of stuff we don't really need to worry about it just yet um I might do some videos about that in the future if you guys are interested and my friend John actually has a Skillshare class linked in the video description about music theory if you care but we're going to ignore music theory for now and just focus on the things you actually have to know to be able to play the song. Basically what we have now is we have all of the chords for the song we can see I found a love is a C and then for me is says it's a m which is a minor darling just dive right in which is an f and follow my lead um and level one is where we just play the note so to do this you have to google what are the notes of a piano C D E F G A B C and we're only allowed to play the seven notes you don't need to be you don't need to touch any of the black notes at all we're only allowed to play these seven white notes and so level one of playing the piano and singing at the same time is where you're singing the song but you're playing just the single note while you're singing and ultimately guitar times is telling you what that note is so for example I found a long for me darling just dive right in and follow my lead I found a girl beautiful and sweet and so on I'm just playing the single note and I'm just following that based on awesome guitar and I'm singing it at the level where that sounds more or less legit so that's level one let's move on to level two and level two is where we get very slightly fancy by playing the octave so on a piano we have C D E F G A B C to C and C this is the same note they're just an octave apart and a piano just has these notes repeated C C C C C C it's all the same note just an octave apart and so now instead of just playing one note we're gonna play an octave and we can play with a left hand or we can play with a right hand I prefer playing the octave with the left so you take your pinky and your thumb and we are playing the octave nice and easy we just know the note to the piano we're playing the octave while we're singing the song and so on quite straightforward all right level three is where it starts to get really interesting and now we are playing chords with our right hand and so when it tells you an ultimate guitar what the chord is like C or A minor or F or G you want to play that chord and you can always google how to play these chords on the piano but essentially the the key of C major is very nice because basically it's always the same shape it's play the note, skip a note, play a note, skip a note and play a note hopefully you recognize this is like a sound that like it makes up the basis of a lot of music so this is chord a major triad major because it sounds happy and triad because there are three some there are three notes in it and so this is the C major triad it's a C skip a note E skip a note G I have a triad okay so that's easy this is the C triad what is the G triad while you hit a G skip a note B skip a note D G major triad what about the F triad F skip a note A skip a note C major triad A minor is a bit different the nice thing so minor chords tend to sound sad this sounds a bit more sad this would be like an A major which is a bit more happy whereas this is a minor it's a bit more sad but the nice thing again we don't need to worry about what a minor chord is in the key of C it's again just play the A skip a note play the C skip a note play the E and so your hand can be in this like a C like position C A minor F B A minor F G you can see that my hand is my my Claw position is just not changing at all I could even do it like this which is these three fingers and I could just literally play that would be how you play the triad so I'm going to play with my thumb my index finger and my ring finger because that's how I like to play the triads and now we're going to sing along over the top once you've done a little bit of practice with this so here's how it might sound like I found a girl beautiful and sweet and I never knew you were that someone waiting for me because we were just kids when we fell in love not knowing words we were just kids when we fell in love not knowing A minor it was I will not ask you up this C G G all in just kids me slow I'm going to notice a seat played over here is exactly the same as the C played up there it just sounds exactly the same system one is lower than the other an A minor played over here is identical to an A minor played over there so this is the major triad again we're skipping a load of stuff about music theory but I'm trying to take you through these ten levels as quickly as possible so that you can find out more about these different bits depending on which level you're at all right level four is now where we're going to play the right hand triads but we're going to add some rhythm to it so you're basically going to want to play them on the beat of the song for example they B B I'm dancing in the dark with you but swinging my arms so if I'm playing the chorus right here I know it's A minor F C G and the chorus is like twice as fast as the verses and it's just telling me when I have to play the chords and ultimate guitar so baby I am F thing in the C with G between my A minor F O no I wanna see assuming G or A minor when you F you look to C I whispered G underneath my A minor you F it done and you C look G preferred to C so literally following a mathematical formula I've got my hand in that position and I'm just playing along with the beat of the song the beat of the song is going to change depending on what song you're singing so that's if we did I'm hearing what you say but I just can't meet the sound it's not quite the same beat as perfect by a cheering but it's it's a vibe and so that is level four where you're like banging out the rhythm while you're just playing that simple triad that we already know alright level five is where we start to get really interesting and now we're going to put our two hands together now remember how earlier in level two we played the octave so this is the C octave A octave F octave G octave now we're going to combine the octave in the left hand with the triad in the right hand now this is going to be fun this is going to be good if ultimately guitar taps tells me to play a C going back to let's say we're going for verse two well I know that's a C because it tells me to C so I want to play a C and a C with my left hand the octave and with my right hand I want to play the triad the C the E the G this is a C octave and triad and I want to do this for all my things and again my hand is staying exactly the same position C A minor F G C A minor F G my fingers are not moving my hand is literally stuck in this position and this is all I'm doing so if I was singing this it would be well I found a woman strong in the name and you want to know she shares my dreams I hope that someday we'll share our home I found a love and now if I were doing my rhythm thing I could do that as well I found a love to carry more than just my secrets to carry love carry children of our home we were still kids but we soon we'll love find in the dance song so you'll notice that I'm rhythming it with just my right hand it's a bit much if you rhythm it with both so I'm just playing the octave holding the octave with a left hand and rhythming with the right hand so that is level five moving on to level six now this is getting really fun now we're gonna do the same thing but we're gonna play an arpeggio with the right hand now this is a triad a C major triad made up of C in G and when we play the chord we play them together but now we're gonna play them separately so instead of playing together we play separately and you can do this with all the chords so this is C going to A minor going to F going to G it's back to C to A minor again this takes a little bit of practice but this is just a broad overview and now we can combine these things together we can play the octave with the left hand and we can play the arpeggio with the right hand you might find it easier to just do the right hand initially so let's just do the right hand while we're singing along we are still kids but we're so we love find in a can store lots I know we'll be all right it's time darling just hold my hand and I'm gonna add in the left hand octave just playing the octave be my girl I'll be your man I see my future in you get the idea just playing an octave and then arpeggiating the chord on the right hand takes a bit of practice but this is already getting us to the level where you know if someone looked at you playing the piano playing a level six or five whichever level we're on they were thinking that this person is reasonably okay at playing the piano so moving on to level seven now we're going to be arpeggiating the left hand as well and this is where it gets fun now when we're playing an octave in C major I E we're only allowed to hit the white notes you want to look at where your index finger naturally ends up for example if I'm playing a C octave my index finger ends up on a G and this is the fifth the other way of thinking about this is that if you were to play a C major triad what would the last note of that triad be in the answer is a G and so when you're playing with the octave with the left hand at this level we're not going to add in we're going to add in the fifth so we're going to add in the G as a note that we're allowed to play so this is what it would sound like with C A minor I'm hitting an E F I'm hitting a C and G I'm hitting a D it's nothing fancy it's just we're taking the octave and we're adding in that middle note which is the fifth which is the end note of the triad if we were to play it again if you haven't done music before this will seem like hard but with a little bit of practice this becomes very second nature because it's just where your index finger ends up landing and so at this level while we're singing along we can occasionally hit that middle note of the left hand chord that without that that we're playing so let's say I was playing a C I could play it like this where it's just the octave but I could occasionally hit a G so if I was playing an A minor this is triad plus octave and I could occasionally hit the E and this would sound pretty legit so I'll show you what this sounds like when I'm singing where I'm just occasionally hitting that note so that would be where I'm playing the triad playing the octave with the left hand and occasionally hitting the middle note the fifth of the left hand chord let's now move on to level eight all right guys we're nearly at the end level eight is now where we're going to arpeggiate and alternate and spam the notes of the left hand so again if I'm playing a C I'm only I'm allowed to hit C G C playing an A minor A E A playing an F F C F playing a G G D G those are the notes I'm allowed to hit and I'm gonna spam this on the left hand by like randomly yeah just like in whatever order I want basically but like a reasonable order is like this so similar to what we did with the right hand where we were going like this when I're doing the same with the left hand and this is now what this sounds like if we are doing so I'm just gonna play a triad on the right hand and I might occasionally rhythm it I think fancy in the right hand and in the left hand I'm gonna play a random you know random notes in the arpeggio so here's how I might go if I'm singing along at the same time I found a love I never knew you were that someone went for me because we were just kids when sounds pretty reasonable let's now move on to level 9 all right level 9 is now where we start to get really fancy and we spam the notes of the chord that we're allowed to do with our right hand and also our left hand now this is where it starts to get really fun because you can do funky things with it so we know what the triad is we know what the octave is with the fifth and we're gonna randomly spam those notes in a way that sounds reasonably aesthetic and that kind of goes with the rhythm of the song so here is what that might sound like never knew you were that someone went for me because we were just kids when we were not knowing what it was I will not give you this time you see I'm just spamming random notes and with a bit of practice this starts to sound reasonable one way of making it sound a bit more reasonable is not going super ham on the spamming of the notes so for example and then you can go really ham on the choric on the choric so baby so I'm going much more ham on the chorus because that's like a bit higher energy but really the only notes I'm playing are the triad in the right hand with that chord position and the octave in the left hand with the you know index finger fifth note occasionally thrown in and if you can do this with a bit of practice this will look like you really know what you're doing on playing the piano let's now move on to level 10 where we put it all together with inversions alright level 10 is now where we talk about inversions now this is slightly fancier but there are different ways of playing every chord let's take a C major chord which we know is and we know that because a keyboard only has one two three four five six seven notes that we're allowed to play and then like beginning all the black notes and then everything repeats so playing a C and E and a G is the same whether you play there or up there or up there or down here it's all the same chord but crucially you don't have to start on the official note of the chord if you want to play a C major chord you don't have to start with a C and then go up you can't start with a C and then go down to the notes that you're interested in so C G E this is still a C major chord it's just a different inversion of it so the C is the final note rather than the first note this is one way of doing it this is one way of doing it and what you can do is you can kind of memorize the different inversions very easy to do in the key of C major because it's again it's all the same kind of hand shape the other way of doing it is where the C is the middle note of the chord so we know that C major chord has C E G but we don't have to play those ones we can play C E and the G underneath so that is another inversion of a C major chord how why is this important well you might notice that when we're playing levels one to nine our hand has to move around a lot around the keyboard so it's like C and then you're jumping up to a major minor or C jumping down to a minor and then maybe jumping up to an F and then jumping down to a D G it's a lot of moving around and stuff just generally sounds better when your fingers are moving around less so for example if I was playing a C major chord like this and I knew the next one was an A minor instead of moving my whole hand up to an A minor what I could do is I could play the A minor inversion which looks like that so A and C and now the difference between C major and A minor is just one note it's a very different sounding chord but it's just a one note difference between the two so let's go and see to A minor now I want to play a G and I want to have minimal movement it wouldn't make sense for me to play a G all the way up here because I'm moving my hand a lot so if I'm on a A minor I might want to play a G like this so I'm taking my A minor shape which is in which is pinky index thumb and just moving it down on and now I've got a G major chord and if I want an F I can do the same thing just move down rather than my hand going all over the place so once you've learned the inversions then as you're playing any of these songs that you want to know where you can get the chords off of ultimate guitar tabs you can choose to use the different inversions off the chords and I'm going to show you putting all of this together what this ultimately looks like. and so on putting all of this together going from level zero through to ten of playing piano without taking any lessons by just following this tutorial and random youtube videos and google images with a bit of practice you can get to the point where you can sing any song in the world that you want once you've got the chords off of ultimate guitar tabs using these ten different levels so this is perfect by a cheer and I'll play a little bit of this and then we'll do a few other songs so baby don't sit in the taunt you between my hands bear foot on the cross listen into I feel it's all I have faith in what I've seen now I know I have met you in person she the perfect night and all of that except a bit of the anywhere I was just playing see major tried all the way up and all of that is basically what we've learned in the last half an hour of level zero through to ten of playing the piano and singing at the same time hopefully you like this if you guys want to see more on this piano kind of stuff do let me know in the comments down below music is like a really fun part of my life and I haven't really talked about it on the channel much before but it's the sort of thing I want to talk a lot more about thank you so much for watching and I'll see you in the next video bye
