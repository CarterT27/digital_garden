# James Arthur - "Say You Won't Let Go" | Acoustic cover ft. Matticus Vlogs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZPiBcz3nSc
Cheeky acoustic cover of 'Say You Won't Let Go' today. This was fairly impromptu - after we filmed our upcoming collaboration video "Tips for Freshers starting University", we realised that we both played piano and enjoyed singing, so we decided to smash out a recording in around 15 minutes. Enjoy xx

## Transcript
 Hey guys, welcome back to the channel, if you're new here, my name is Ali and I'm a junior doctor working in Cambridge, and today's been quite interesting because I made a new friend, his name is Matikus, and he's a physiotherapist student at the University of Southampton, and he's also a YouTuber. He makes videos and vlogs about life as a physiotherapist. We filmed a collab video of sorts, giving tips for new freshers starting university, so those two videos will be up on mine and his channel in the next couple of weeks, so you should definitely subscribe to him. But quite excitingly, we realised when he got here that we had a shared love of music, and a shared love of James Arthur, so we decided to record an impromptu cover of C1 like go, and here it is, I hope you enjoy it. Too much, I held your hair back when it was throwing up, and it's fun, what you're sure for and off the cold summer, I'll pull you closer to my chas, and you ask me to stay all of them, I say, I already told you, I think that you should get some rest, and I know I love you, and you never know, I played a cool and now I'm still letting go. I know I needed you, but I'll never show, but I want to stay with you, and to like, oh, just say, oh like go, just say, oh like go. Oh, we killed with some breakfast and bed, I'll bring you coffee with you, piss on your head, and I'll take the kids to school where they're gonna die, I'll find my lucky star for the night. You look so your shoulder for a bit of a get-on, I'm older, I wanna die for you right now. You look stiff and fat, and I swear everything will get better. You'll let me feel as weird somehow. I'm so in love with you, oh, you look, darling, you're less more than worth this waiting moment. We've got so far my dear, look how we've gone, I wanna save you into a grand old, just say, oh like go, oh like go, just say, oh like go. Oh, I wanna live with you, even when when it goes, you're always there for me, I need your most. I'm gone, I love you too, I love you, I'll ask you if I'll, I promise you, death will be part of my kingdom now. So I wrote the song for you, and I'll everybody know that it's just you and me, it's you and I'll just say, oh like go, just say, oh like go, say, oh like go. So, look, thanks back.
