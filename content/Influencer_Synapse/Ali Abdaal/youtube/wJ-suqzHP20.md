## Transcript
 Hey guys, welcome back to the channel. If you're new here, my name is Ali. I'm a final year medical student at Cambridge University and this is part three of our three part revision tips Q&A series where you guys set in questions and me and two of my medical student friends We answered them a couple of weeks ago back when this channel was on like 10,000 subscribers. This video is gonna be about how to prepare for university exams But I think the tips will also apply to people with very content heavy-a-level syllabuses or GCSE syllabuses. So, bye, syllabuses. I don't know. If you're looking the description, you'll find links to loads more videos that we've done about Evidence-based revision tips and if you haven't seen them already, I'd really recommend you watch the first one about Active Recall and the second one about space repetition This video, this Q&A sort of assumes you already know those very basic things because Active Recall and space repetitions are by far the single biggest things you can do to really make your revision much much more efficient If you don't know about those yet, then please ignore this video. Watch those first because without those tips It's like anything I say is gonna be completely pointless. So in terms of structure, we're gonna start this video with me giving you four tips for how to do well in University style exams, but as I said, I hope the tips will also apply to A-level and GCSE students as well, and then in the second part of the video We'll be answering seven different questions that you guys sent in a couple of weeks ago and as usual everything is gonna be linked in timestamps in the in the description below. Please don't watch this whole video Please look in the description and like go to the appropriate timestamp based on the stuff that you think will add the most value to your life Uh, this is probably gonna be quite a long video, so I wouldn't like advocate you watching all of it Firstly, I want to talk about the importance of scoping your subject And we talked about this in a previous Q&A video, but I want to expand on it in a bit more detail here Scoping your subject is really really really important I've had a few messages from people over the last couple of weeks saying stuff like oh, I've got I've got 70 lectures to get through in the next three weeks. I don't know how I'm gonna do it The way you do it is by scoping your subject and make sure you have like this broad Conceptual outline of all of the different subjects that make up your subject all the different topics that make it up and within each topic All the important sub topics as well and that's a very first thing you should be doing before you get started with any kind of Religion at all, but I think it mistake that a lot of University students make and possibly the supplies to A11 and GCC as well is that you think oh crap I've got 70 lectures to get through and you start going through them chronologically and just trying to make notes and then we're trying to learn the lectures But learning the lectures is not very efficient way of kind of inviting information into your brain Instead what you want to be doing is scoping your subject You want to have a look through just like a quick skim through all 70 of those lectures and see if you can break it up into Manageable topics if your university's organized your course will already be split up into various Manageable topics, so it won't be 70 lectures you have to get through it'll be Maybe five lectures on this topic and 15 lectures on that topic and then 12 lectures on that topic and in totally you might only have Like seven topics now seven topics to get through in four weeks or how long you have is a lot more manageable than oh crap I have to get through 70 lectures So firstly, split up everything you need to do into into Manageable topics and you can see more about my revision Spreadsheet space repetition system that's based around Kind of doing one or two or three topics each day and then doing active recall of those topics But the first thing that's really important is to have these topics down now once you've got this list of topics Again, don't think that oh crap. I've got 70 lectures to go through instead you want to be thinking okay What are the main salient points of these topics? What's like the broad skeleton of each of these topics like how would you summarize it in one line? Okay, now can you summarize it in five lines or a bit more detail? Can you summarize it in a single page with a bit more detail? I think another mistake that people make that I certainly used to make back in the day and that a lot of my friends Used to make we've now learned better. We would we would focus on single lecture series or single lectures and try and learn the detail like learn the lecture And as I said earlier learning the lecture is not very effective Instead we just want to be getting a broad idea of what was in that lecture what the subheadings were right in this lecture about Diabetes we talked about management. We talked about investigation done. Okay in the next lecture We were talking about insulin specifically and how the pancreas works the next lecture We were talking about all the various diabetic drugs and their mechanisms of action done all these these three lectures We're quite long lectures. There's a load of loaded detail in them, but you know We've just summarized it in one or two words saying what was in that lecture and if we do this for every lecture We get in our heads a very good understanding of what goes into our course and then looking at past papers and looking at kind of essay questions That sort of thing we can start targeting the errors that we need to prioritize so going back to this again If you are in the position where you have 70 lectures or however many lectures to get through in a small amount of time What I was to do is maybe like give yourself five minutes per lecture and and stick to that only five minutes for each lecture and in that five minutes You want to skim through it and just kind of jot down the most salient points right down kind of the the topics and the subheadings that you want within that if you spend five minutes Doing that for all 70 lectures that's 350 minutes that can very easily be done in a single day a single morning or an afternoon And now you suddenly have a broad understanding of what's in the what's in this entire entire subject So it's not 70 lectures to get through it's you know targeted topics I really can't say this more and fathically It's really really important to scope your subject that would be my first tip for university students or if you're a level of GCC and you have very content heavy stuff scope your subject The second tip is if you have essays in your exam and I know I'm most university courses the exams tend to be S a based if you're exams or I say based then base your revision around planning essays So again going to the going back this to going back to this lecture thing Let's say we have 10 lectures to get through what we don't want to do is think right I'm gonna go through lecture one and then I'm gonna go through lecture two and then I'm gonna go through lecture three instead Take those 10 lectures within a single topic for example and either using past papers Hopefully they've given you previous essay titles Hopefully you've had supervisions or tutorials or whatever where they've given you essay titles But if not and I think to yourself if I were an examinant of what kind of essay what I feasibly set on this and then Just like answer the essay question like make make an essay plan and base your your answer around these 10 lectures and around your further reading That way in the end when you've done enough essay plans A you if if one of them comes up in the exam and the likelihood of that is is pretty high You've already planned like a really really good essay for that So you don't even have to think in the exam you just regurgitate the essay you've already planned That's the best case scenario even if that doesn't happen You will still have covered all of the content of the of the lectures But you'll have done it in a in a focused way a way that kind of answers specific questions Therefore you know you're targeting the material that's most important rather than kind of sometimes the fluff that we do see in lectures and in and in wider reading So first you'll be talking the content in the focused fashion and secondly There is a bit of evidence that shows that when you have this sort of structure where you're and a structuring your revision based around Actively trying to answer a question actively trying to go for this goal of what is the answer to this question? How would it write the essay that reach that improves your your understanding and your retention of of the topic? So there are a lot of different benefits to using essay plans that's the way forward if you're in this position where you have lots of lectures to get through an Sports a small space of time and you know your exam is based on essays then prepare for the exam as bad as it sounds You know if if you only have a few weeks until your exam and you're concerned about your exam The exam is what you need to be preparing for yes universities for wider Learning and for wider experience and this that and the other but really you know There comes a point where we have to focus on the exam and focusing on the exam means if it's an essay based exam Just do lots and lots of essay plans structure your revision around those Thirdly very quick tip if you're doing like maths or physics or engineering I've had a few messages from people doing those subjects asking how do you use your active Requel method for maths and physics? I don't know I don't do maths or physics at university I wouldn't use my spreadsheet method of active recall writing questions for myself if I were doing maths and physics I'd be focusing on problem sheets and on pass papers because that is you know It's it's applied stuff that is what test your knowledge of it Although having said that my brother did maths and he made lots of flashcards for various proofs I understand in maths and in some of these subjects you have to prove various things and Obviously you don't want to be deriving the proof from first principles in the exam So you want to memorize the proof and you can do that using anky using any kind of flashcard Using a spreadsheet based repetition system again more on that in videos that will be linked here and in the in the description below And finally I want to get on to one of the most important points for getting through university life in an Aficion and stress freeway and that is to really make use of people in the year above and in the years above that Who have been through the course before you if you've ever tried this you'll find that students in the years above are more than happy to give you advice like we are I'm a 60 student now. There are students five years below me. I absolutely love it when people come to me and I'll ask me for advice I'll tell you how do you how do you maximise your mark in this exam or whatever you've only tips for this? Have you got any tips of that and I think what a lot of students sometimes feel is that kind of like like You know when you're in year seven you feel like you don't really want to talk to the year tens because of the year tens and they're like scary Maybe people have this when it comes to university stuff when it comes to you know GCC a little stuff Please don't have this at all Especially when you get to university this whole year group divide thing completely disappears as a sixth year I I love being friends with people in the year below and I is it's just like it's it's just flattering It's nice. I I like the fact that I can give advice that I can share my notes and the vast majority of students that I've met are in the same position So if you are struggling with your subject just find someone in the year above They're like really not hard to find you can see them around campus or around your college or around your Islamic society or your Christian Union or whatever watering holes you like to spend time in just find people in the year above Ask them for their notes. Ask them if they've got any advice for you and generally just kind of try and make friends with people who are older than you This is one of my kind of biggest pointers for for university life when you're a first year You want to obviously make friends with you with your own year group But do make an effort to you know try and be friends with people in second third Maybe even fourth fifth and fifth and sixth year Firstly, this is important from like quite a selfish perspective that you know you can get their their perspective their Experience you can you can take advantage of all of the pain they've been through to prepare for these same exams that you're preparing for You can use their notes all of that stuff But secondly, it's also it's also just quite nice broad in broadening your like your network and kind of this whole thing about university One of the one of the biggest perks is is is the people you meet and if you have been friendly with people in years above you then it just increase your circle of friends It makes everything a lot more a lot more nice You can ask them for advice They can ask you for advice if they've got friends younger than you and it just creates this nice kind of cohesive community of everyone helping each other out And just kind of just kind of on this note if you're a young student if you're a young Ghost student trying to make friends with people in the year in the years above you kind of need to be the one to make the effort And the reason for this is that Speaking from the perspective of the six there and like I enjoy having friends in in years below It gives a different perspective. It's just you know nice meeting you people, but I would feel kind of kind of Creepy if I were the one making most of the effort to begin with Because it just it just seems a bit weird. I'm a 60 or there are four-thier of This is like barrier you have as an older student kind of trying to be friends with a younger student at least initially It just feels a little bit weird whereas for example when I was in first year For a friend of mine who was a few years above me gave me this really good advice He said make sure you make friends with the people in the years above so I actively made quite a lot of effort to get to know the people in my College in the years above and the people in the Pakistan society this long anxiety and and that sort of things and a lot of them I'm still friends with to this day But I think if I hadn't made the effort if I'd kind of waited for them to extend this hand of friendship They might have felt a bit weird about it because it's a bit weird when you're a third year and you're kind of trying to be friend of pressure It's just a bit odd whereas if you're that first year and you're kind of extending the hand of friendship to the third year That's a lot more legit and actually this would be one of my One of my massive pointers for people going into the clinical years of medical school that when you get into placements at hospitals and stuff You want to be the one to make friends with a junior doctors the FYI ones the FYT who's the people who are in who have been in that position like that You're in five years ago and again they want to be friends with you like I'm gonna be an FYI one next year And I would like you know if there are medical students in my hospital on my ward I would love to be friends with them But I would feel weird if I were the one extending the hand of friendship It would be a lot less weird if they were the ones who you know were kind of being pally with me because then I know where I stand I don't want to have this thing in my head. Oh, you know, there are fourth year medic and I'm a junior doctor and on the female which is even worse What if it's seen as creepy if I'm like oh, hey, do you want to grab a coffee and we can go over some stuff? You know that would be great whereas if that fourth year medic would be like hey, you know Are you free of a lunch can you give us a mini supervision? I would be like yes, hell yeah, so of course I can I would love to share my knowledge with you. I'd love to impart some wisdom I'd love teaching and literally everyone I know is in this position So I've talked about this a quite a while please please please make friends with the people in the years above you as the youngest student You need to be the one to extend this hand of friendship and in terms of preparing for exams This comes back to you a hundredfold because people will share share with you their notes their resources or their material They're parted PDFs of textbooks whatever you asked him for and they'll give you advice on how to do well on this exam So if you want doing this already please please please make friends with and then subsequently take advantage of people in the years above Okay, so that was my four tips on how to do well in university exams point number one scope your subject point number two base everything around essay plans If it's an essay subject point number three if you're doing maths engineering physics Past papers of the way forward from what I understand and point number four please make friends with the people in the People in the years above you asked them for help. Austin for guidance. It is the way forward It is the way to make you whole university experience a lot more fun and a lot less stressful Now we're gonna cut to various questions that you guys sent in a couple of weeks ago for the 10,000 subscribers Q&A I think there are four questions aimed at university students about lectures and stuff and then there's two questions like random questions So that me my friends Paul and Catherine were gonna be answering those again everything's gonna be timestamped in the description below So if you've reached the vid this far in the video, then thank you very much for watching I hope you I hope you found it useful so far But please look in the timestamp to see what specific questions were answering at what timestamps you can kind of target those appropriately What you can just like watch the whole video doesn't really matter whatever you like here are me pulling Catherine answering some of the questions You guys have sent it How do you revise a year's worth of undergrad work in a month? Well, so the first thing you need to do is scope the subject and then after that then decide which bits I can check up, you know The most essential bits the bits which are gonna get you 80% of the marks zooming on those absolutely cut it out into bite-sized chunks How do you make a good revision time table? I don't like erosion time tables. You do how do you make a good one? I always make revision time too. So as I said the first thing to do is scope The next thing to do is you every day you need to So you need to cut it out into into chunks there actually feasible realistic for you to do it I think a lot of people come and come and stack as well because they're like oh, you know, today I'm gonna reach three chapters and actually three you can the maximum work you can do is one chapter Along with that in my type of table as well. I usually put in the kind of things that I'm gonna be doing for the day Like if I'm visiting a friend if I've got a dinner appointment up at that end so that I can budget them out of a work I need to do and the last thing which I'd say is also give yourself a wiggle room today So I give myself this days which is cool Spill days so spill days are just you know for me to play around my time within that block and You know for days when procrastinating then that allows for that spill Next question. How do you cope with the massive work that you get in uni? I've heard that with medicine you're not actually expected to cover every single topic before exams because there's just so much to cover Again scope the subject Workout which well what the what the point this detail is that's you know for those kids coming top of the year and Spend your time focusing on the stuff, you know the bread and butter that's gonna get you most of the marks Also, especially in stuff like medicine the workload really isn't that bad. I think a lot of medics and like My brother he did he did maths he get you guys really know about this because this is all medics talk about Medics love to talk about how bloody hard their degree is and how much workload there is and Everyone from the age of like 12 who's even thinking of doing medicine gets fed this narrative of oh My god medicine is so so so so hard that's so much work. It's such a dump jump between the end of the university Yeah, there is a jump between the end of the university Yes, there is a lot of work, but like it's not that medicine is conceptually hard It's just a load of content to cover and you can do it arguably something like maths and engineering is a lot harder Where you actually have to think where it's medicine you just you just memorize stuff and there are techniques to memorize stuff Like you know space repetition active recall if you're applying to medicine or if you've got enough of medicine Or even if you're medical student Let's try and you know break this narrative of oh my god medicine is so hard I'm so hard done by because I'm doing medicine and it's such a such hard work Come on You can do it. It's fine. It's doable But I actually think there's more of a philosophical thing right part of the reason why people think there's a big jump between School and university and part of the reason why people think that medicine is harder than I don't know another subject That has less content. Why is even though it might be more conceptually difficult? Is because with medicine because there are a lot of detailed facts you can learn It can kind of go on forever and you have to be good at setting that point at which you decide Okay, I'm gonna learn this much And I'm not gonna learn all the You know hundred two hundredth causes of Actual fibrillation because actually that's not what's relevant. That's not what's important I need to cover the bare bones and the basics first and then I can build up from there And you know it's part of the reason people find it so difficult is because they just feel like they could go on forever And that they've got to study study 24 seven But I really don't have to be the case You need to know enough to be a competent safe doctor And you don't need to carry on studying forever and ever until you know you tie yourself to death. Yeah, very good point Okay, next question How do you get through recommended and independent reading quickly? So this is sort of for subjects that require wider reading that give you reading lists. Oh my gosh When I was doing my third year You know most people do something like on a psychology Which is at least relevant to medicine so you you know where you start a little bit Whereas I apparently thought it was a good idea to do politics psychology and sociology So it was a little bit out of my depth doing an arts subject that I had no experience of not even a level So um one of the best tips that someone gave me was to read book reviews because this is a bit of a cheat Because in a book review it tends to give you a summary of what the book said and then also gives you some critique of the book So it was actually super useful in getting through You know getting an overall idea of the text that I just couldn't physically get through because my reading speed was so poor because I had not read in those kind of volumes Since school yeah, that is Another tip that I have for getting through reading is that don't bother reading the whole book Have a have a goal with mine read with a goal in mind I found this sort of I find it really useful to structure my revision around an SATI to like do animals have a theory of mind Then like all the 20 different papers that are on the reading list and five text books I'm fully just intently focused on answering that question and anything that doesn't directly answer that question I throw away if it does and it sounds nice I'll memorize that paragraph put it into my flash god deck and we go to take it in the exam with a bit of you know addition, so it doesn't like but with a bit of editing so that it doesn't look like plagiarism So um so some quick five tips I would say First of all review papers to the best like then from there you can link to a primary research and secondly to just a reiterate What are you saying read with a golden mind so for example for me usually I reverse engineer it I think this is a point I want to make in my essay then I go on Google and I look for research a literature that supports it and then find the paragraph that supports it Yeah, and then coat the paper and then there you go You don't need to read a whole thing. It's all about quoting papers without having actually read them You find those papers and reviews like you know, so so for example in in one of my psychology essays about IQ I will in in in in in in the introduction. I would have said Gender differences in intelligence and IQ have been being studied for for for centuries Could you know someone from 1902? I obviously haven't read this person's 1902 paper or that person's 1775 paper But I read the fact that he said that in some other paper and I'm gonna reference it as an act as if I've read that paper You know, so you go on. I mean, so you're making the reference from the sentence without actually reading the paper I think that's a good way of getting through the stuff very quickly Or you can even just Google history of IQ research find the right paper and then just coat them straight away Yeah, don't you don't need to read the paper. Yeah Anyway, uh next question Rough process from getting introduced to a lecture course and then steps taken to make the revision to material for it Do you make flash got throughout the year? Do you look at exams papers first? This is asking from a binary asking oh hello. So I'd say It's all it was up to you because it did from people different studying styles and what they prefer Understanding is very important. We talked that we talked about that before. Are you able to explain this to somebody else? And then after that active recall is very important, but that that comes when you're trying to revise it So yeah, so so what I would do with lecture courses is if if if the lecture notes are good I don't I don't make any notes at all all I make as questions So I make questions based on the lecture notes and yeah, I didn't then I did that answer them and if I can't answer one I'll find the answer in the lecture notes So that's kind of practicing active recall if the lecture notes are really bad Then you kind of have to make notes because you have no other choice So you try and find a review paper try and find a revision guide try and find some guy on some forum who's like written the notes out for you Anything to avoid having to make notes yourself, but sometimes it's necessary. Yeah look for this smart help for guy and you have new course Yeah, ask are someone like Paul Paul can I have your notes or are asking your friends in the euro bar of you know from your own collage Or from you know the Islamic society or from the Singapore says I like literally anything There's so many so many people in years above willing to share the notes with you so you don't have to do it Proud sourcing Which leads all well to the next question? What is your opinion on pre-made notes? We love pre-made notes. We don't I don't really like pre-made flashcards because I think pre-made flashcards Kind of defeat the purpose and making the flashcard and encouraging to think enough to you know actually make it a pre-made notes Sorry, I want to say that I know some people I know a lot of people actually like Marcus who who would love making notes for their own revision like they Learn by making the notes itself I think if that's your studying style then good for it. Yeah, I think Especially if you don't quite understand the topic you haven't quite got to grips with it Then making your own notes can be a really important part of that process Well, I mean for people like him then with after they've made the notes they can immediately they can pitch in the mind where That bit of information was and then that helps them so if that's you then good for it Yeah, and then you can share your notes with people who reach off you Pre-made notes Yeah, actually um so like all this stuff that I've been preaching about recently about you know There's no point making notes as a waste of time All of this stuff is purely aimed at people who are making notes and who are not happy with their results If you're the sort of person that spends eight hours making notes and you're getting the ace stars You're getting the sick results, and please continue by all means continue making your notes But if you're the sort of person that spends eight hours making notes and then you're thinking nothing's going in Then maybe it's time to maybe maybe rethink that try some of these other methods You know that that's what I'm saying don't feel like you know just because we say making notes Or sometimes the waste of time that you know it's it's a one-size-fits-all solution active recall however Is a one-size-fits-all solution because active recall is a way of life Great Approaching the end second penultimate question. What is your favorite stationary to work with G2 7 gel blue G2 07 gel blue pants. Yeah, maybe by pilot. Have you said all my exam life? Oh Wow, he does really well exams and G2 07 pilot blue pens.

How do you manage the long days during Ramadan in exam season? Any ideas guys? Interesting question. I haven't experienced them before. Yeah, I have so much to say on this object. Yeah, um, I find one thing I like to do is I get like you know one of the six packs of J2O I stick in the fridge and then you know when it's time when it's time to break the fast I have my date obviously My my my my My Easter day Oh And then you know I crack I crack open a cold J2O and then I just kind of drink it in one and I feel like a real I feel like a real border, you know like what what what what what what what What a one of the businessmen wearing a suit and tie comes home after a hard day of work in the city Pops and put a coconut cold beer I feel the same as that that baller, but with a J2O And another cheating strategy is just kind of Sleep after fudge or wake up and really late Controversial people say that kind of defeats the purpose of Ramadan, but I think that's kind of what I used to do What I did last year in exam term year before that when it was kind of overlapping but yeah Good luck Okay, perfect That brings us to the end of this Q&A.
