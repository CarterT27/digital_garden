## Transcript
 Welcome to WWE DC! Hey guys, welcome back to the channel. If you're new here, my name is Ali, I'm a junior doctor working in Cambridge and in this video I'm going to be taking advantage of my vast swaths of medical expertise And I'm going to be sharing some of the highlights from Apple's WWE DC 2019 keynote As usual, all the things I'm going to talk about are going to be linked in timestamps in the video description and in a pinned comment and over here So you don't have to watch the whole video if you've got something better to do with your time Oh, it's awesome! But yeah, let's just get into it So the thing I'm probably most excited about is iPad OS We're just coming out this autumn and I absolutely love my iPad I use it every single day at work for about 10 hours a day. I use it when I get home I use it for almost everything except a few things that only the laptop can do And the cool thing about this new iPad OS is that it's making a specific operating system just for the iPad Which means the iPad is getting closer and closer to being a genuine laptop replacement And I think actually when it comes out this autumn the iPad will be able to replace a laptop for a lot of people I'm going to do a separate video covering the iPad OS more in depth because I'm such an iPad evangelist And I've been singing the praises of the iPad Pro to everyone for the last two years But just quickly the things that I'm really excited about are firstly split screen functionality Secondly, the fact that you can now attach external drives to your iPad Pro Which makes it actually legit for photo and video editing Thirdly, they're finally going to change the annoyance of moving a cursor around on the screen Which was a big impediment to actually getting real work done Secondly, they're introducing a ton more keyboard shortcuts So if you have the external keyboard thing like I do, you'll be able to be a lot more efficient on the iPad Which was one of my major beefs with it And finally, they're also introducing desktop mode on Safari Which means you can use Safari as a fully fledged web browser rather than just the mobile version And this is going to be really handy for me personally for editing websites and ghost and square space And also for everyone who ever uses Google Docs and is annoyed by the fact that you can't edit Google Docs on an iPad So yeah, those were the highlights for me I think all the iPad OS features are moving a cursor and closer to being a laptop replacement And I suspect when it comes out this autumn, it's probably going to replace my laptop for everything except like video editing Apple also announced the latest version of iOS iOS 13, which is going to be coming out this fall And the main thing that they were kind of selling about this was the fact that Doc mode is now a thing on iOS and on iPad OS So if you were the sort of person who uses their phone in bed or at night, that's going to be kind of good I personally have stopped using my phone in bed ever since I read the book Why We Sleep And that told me that I shouldn't use my phone in bed So I've been having it across the room from me So I don't think I'm going to be using Doc mode personally, but it seems like it's the face lift that everyone was excited about Some new features that I think will be genuinely useful are firstly the new swipe keyboard I've tried third party alternatives like Swift key and stuff and I've never found them to be that good But now that Apple is introducing a native swipe keyboard, it means you can reply to text and stuff from your hand Like very quickly, you just using one hand, which is pretty awesome I'm also quite excited about the new photos feature So as everyone does, I take a ton of photos on my iPhone And I almost never look back through them So what the new photos feature does is that it makes a little tab where it reserves Some of your photos and gives you different memories from different times and puts them all together So if you want to go through your photos, it's like a nice way of reliving your memories There are also introducing a lot of new features for video editing on an iPhone And this seems a bit weird, but I think this is going to be quite helpful because when I'm posting videos of myself Playing piano and singing songs to my Instagram story I film it on my iPhone and then I have to edit it on my iPhone and it's not very good experience You can't really do much with it So the fact of that a more comprehensive video editing experience is coming to IS Makes me personally quite excited And then they talk a little bit about how they're going to update Apple Maps Which honestly no one really cares about And actually one thing that they did talk about was how they're having these like memojis These personalised emojis And now you can finally have profile pictures for people in iMessage This is a feature that's been missing for absolutely ages So I'm quite excited to see how that works on my phone Thirdly, Apple unveiled the latest version of Mac OS Which is called Catalina, which is apparently named after a place in California But the cool thing about that is that the wallpaper is really pretty So I'm probably going to stick to the default wallpaper But there's two features that I'm really excited about Firstly is the side car feature that lets you use your iPad Pro or iPad As an external display for your MacBook I take my MacBook everywhere with me and often when I'm home I want to be doing some video editing But I often demo in the lack of an external display And there have been some solutions to this over the years Things like duet and other hardware solutions But there've never been that great And I think now that Apple is making a first-party alternative for this That's going to be a genuinely useful feature And secondly, there was quite a lot of banter in the keynote about how bad iTunes is And it was kind of cool that Apple were poking fun at themselves About how bad iTunes is But the cool thing is that they're now going to turn iTunes into three different apps So that's Apple Music, Apple Podcast and Apple TV Rather than iTunes trying to do absolutely everything But I think the most important part is that when you plug your iPhone into your MacBook to try and sync something It's not going to come up with the iTunes window automatically And this is something that everyone in the keynote was really excited about That when we when he was like, you plug it in and nothing happens And I was like, yeah, thank God for that That was like a big deal for everyone who's experienced the frustration of plugging your iPhone in And suddenly iTunes comes up But yeah, that's probably the thing I'm most excited about with the new Mac OS Fourthly, they announced the new Mac Pro This is now going to be the machine that I lost after that I'm pretty much never going to be able to afford And a lot of jargon that I don't even know what it means Like the presenter got really excited about that 1000 nit display, it was like, okay, what does 1000 nit's mean But everyone in the room seems to get excited about that And then when she mentioned that the power supplies, 1.4 kilowatts Everyone got really excited about that So apparently that must be a big deal But again, I have absolutely no idea what that means Which is probably a good sign that I don't need to get a Mac Pro And I should not even try to maybe think about getting a Mac Pro It's definitely a device aimed at the more pro end of the spectrum I'm quite happy doing that editing on Final Cut on my MacBook Pro But yeah, I'm sure the Mac Pro website thing is going to be on my bookmarks But I'm going to be lusting off trip for the next few years And probably never going to be able to afford it unless Apple feels like sponsoring me So Apple, if you're watching this, then just for the record I will be more than open to getting a review unit of the Mac Pro In doing a video review about what the Mac Pro is like and how it fits into my pro workflow Yeah, first move on Finally, let's talk about this new display that they've made There's a written on 6K display called the Pro Display XDR Which stands for extreme dynamic range The person presenting this was talking a lot about HDR Which is high dynamic range and how it's important to have that on certain monitors And how it's similar to reference monitors that people use in film production But those cost like $43,000 And this cost only $5,000 It seemed like when they announced the price of $5,000 People kind of got excited that oh, this is a good price I saw the $5,000 price tag and I was like what the hell I'd have been kind of leaning towards buying it if it had been less than 1,000 5,000 is just completely ridiculous for a display But I imagine if you're a pro working in those industries And it's an alternative to display to your 43,000 one I imagine it's going to be a good deal for them But then the really funny thing and I think the best part of the keynote for me was When they announced that the stand wouldn't come with the monitor And the stand was going to cost an extra $999 And there's just that moment of silence where everyone in the room is just like what the hell And then you can hear some like mumbling and muttering and everyone being like all what's going on And the presenter, you can see him like floundering a bit when he's like What's going on? I expected applause when people were like You've got to pay an extra $1,000 for this stand for your monitor Because it's just going to come as a panel But yeah, that was quite a funny part of the coverage So that was a brief overview of some of the highlights from WWDC 2019 I'm personally excited about where technology is going And to be honest, I've always wanted to make one of these videos where you just kind of do coverage of like a tech event But in the past, I never felt like enough of a tech YouTuber But now that the YouTube channel has grown and that people come up to me on the streets and be like Oh, I bought an iPad because of you I think I now have the right to Pleasably talk to the camera and explain that I don't know what a thousand nits means But hopefully you guys found this video semi educational and I'm looking forward to the new Run of tech as much as I am And if you like the video, please give it a thumbs up If you haven't subscribed to the channel, then please consider doing so Have a lovely day and I'll see you in the next video Goodbye
