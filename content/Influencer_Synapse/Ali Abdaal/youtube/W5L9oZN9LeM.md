## Transcript
 Good morning! Today we're off on an adventure. We are going to go to this world-life century in the south of the city and to get there. We need to hire a motorbike for scooter and then scoot it down to this world-life century and then we'll see some animals. It's going to be very exciting. Alright, so here we are in the city. We're going to grab some breakfast and then we're going to hire the motorbikes and yeah. Alright, so we've got the bikes now off we go down. I think first we're going to go to the temple, climb a mountain and then we're going to go to the wildlife sanctuary, which should be fun. See you in a bit. So here we are. This is the temple that we're just about to climb up. We're going to be doing it for about two minutes. So these are like proper ruins it seems, but apparently when we go to sea and reap and there's an ankle what and the massive temples over there those are like next level. So stay tuned for the vlog episode about the temples of ankle what bends over there on a rock taking photos. It's really annoying how people are just rock up to ancient historic sites with their cameras and just take photos. I mean why don't just enjoy the place for God's sake. Life is meant to be lived, not meant to be heard about it. Hello again. Here we are at the wildlife sanctuary. It seems like quite a big area and we're just kind of motorbike around, stop at the different enclosures, have a look at the animals and then we'll be on our merry way. We found a restaurant and in this restaurant we get to chill on these hammocks while food arrives and then we'll sit on these little raised areas and it'll be good. That was a great meal. All right now let's go see hello just some elephants and some lines and tigers bears. Oh, hello. Here we are at the Baron closure or something like that. And now we're at the end of our journey. If you go to the end of this video then thank you so much for watching. You're amazing. Please like, comment and subscribe and I'll see you in the next one. Bye bye.
