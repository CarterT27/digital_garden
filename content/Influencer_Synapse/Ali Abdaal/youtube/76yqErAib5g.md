## Transcript
 Alright, so it's been a few years since I've graduated from university but I still always get a bunch of questions from students asking for study tips on how to do well on their exams. So in this video we're going to go through my 20 top tips for studying that I used to do pretty well in my exams while I was at school and also studying medicine at Cambridge University while bidding this YouTube channel and having a business and trying to have some semblance of a social life and enjoying the journey along the way, let's go. And we're going to split this video up into five parts. That is target, revision, technique, friends, and balance. And tip number one is to scope the subject. What this means is that for every subject that we have to prepare for, that we have an exam for, we want to create some sort of tree diagram that gives us a visual representation of everything that we need to learn in the subject. Often one of the things that students struggle with is not appreciating where a given factoid or fact or concept fits within the wider picture. And so the way we want to think of it is like we want to build up the tree from the trunk and like the kind of branches first before we worry about the little details like the leaves. But if you're an lecturer and you're covering like a leaf over there somewhere down some random branch, it can be very hard to like appreciate how it fits into the wider picture. And so as long as we scope the subject and the start of our curriculum and the start of our course and the start of our revision period, that will really help in terms of just appreciating west of fits in. The benefit of this is that you can also then color code the areas that you're weak in. So I like using a kind of red amber green traffic lighty bay system for all the topics. And so add a glance for every subject attack and add to me physiology chemistry physics, whatever. I can see immediately okay these are the red zones and therefore those are the areas that I want to focus my revision on. And that brings the tip number two which is to really focus on your weaknesses. When we're studying for exams, there's the very easy temptation to focus on the things that we are good at. So people invariably revised chapter one and chapter two of everything far more than chapters 19 and 20 at the back of the book. And really the point of the color coding system is that it really helps us target our specific weaknesses. Like if you know you're really good at maths and you know you suck at French like I did in school, there's no point spending ages focusing on maths or spending exactly the same amount of time focusing on maths and French. It's all about recognizing okay I don't need to do much work in this particular subject. I'm going to put a disproportionate amount of effort into the stuff I'm bad at so that I can get to a point where I'm really good at all of the things. In real life this is actually probably bad advice. In general in real life we do better and we get ahead and all that stuff. By focusing on the things we are good at rather than by trying to improve all of our weaknesses to a reasonable standard but generally in schooling university exams it's not the case that like if you get an amazing mark in one subject that makes up for bad marks and the other subject we do have to kind of play this game of getting all of our stuff to a reasonably high level if we're optimizing for exam results at school or at university. And tip number three is to use a retrospective revision timetable. Now I've got a video all about this which will be linked up there in the video description which I think several hundreds of thousands of students have found really helpful. The idea behind a retrospective revision timetable is that it's different to a prospect of revision timetable. Normally when we make a revision timetable we like to list out that oh on this day I'm going to study this and that on you know then next week I'm going to study a bit of renal physiology and a little bit of upper limb anatomy and a little bit of like the crepes cycle in biochemistry and we create this like theoretical plan which A is an exercise in procrastination because it's just creating that prospective revision timetable is a bit of a waste of time and B. I don't know if you're anything like me you never end up actually sticking to that theoretical timetable because real life gets in the way the social stuff that happens and we find maybe I'm good at that thing but not at that thing and so this theoretical plan ends up just going out the window. Instead what I like to do is use a retrospective revision timetable and I've been using this for my exams from like second year of med school onwards and the idea there is that instead of planning what we're going to do in advance we actually just plan it on the day and we again we focus on our weaknesses we figure out okay where are my red zones today you know I was red on physiology so let me study some of that I was red on neuro anatomy so let's study a little bit of that and then once we've studied it we put the date down next to the subject and then we can color code it based on how well we did on that subject on the day and so at the start we have a long list of topics and they're all red because we don't know any of it but then over time the slowly go amber and the slowly go green and if you want more details on that you can check out the actual video on the retrospective revision timetable all right part number two is revision and tip number four is that note taking is broadly a waste of time now this is a bit of a controversial take but there's a bunch of studies that show that students like one of students favorite strategy for studying is to summarize or take notes from the stuff that they're consuming in lectures or the stuff that they're watching videos about or the stuff they're reading in textbooks but there's a decent amount of evidence that says that simply taking notes and summarizing with the book open proverbially is not a very effective way to learn because it's quite a passive thing and it's very easy for us to do and generally we have this misconception when we're trying to learn stuff if that learning should be easy and when learning is easy it feel like what we feel productive yeah I've just done three pages worth notes but actually the way that memory is formed and the way that we build those connections between concepts and topics is by putting effort into it and in a way the more effortful it appears the harder it seems to us the more likely our brain is to form connections between those relevant things and the more likely we are to actually know the topic that's why most students method for taking notes is a little bit of waste of time because all you're doing is summarizing the material whereas there's a bunch of other techniques that have been shown in the scientific literature where they've done hundreds of studies looking at evidence based study tips that are way better than taking notes. Now if you're studying a subject where you actually do need to take notes let's say you're studying English literature at university where there is no easily accessible revision guide and you do need to have some sort of novel interpretation of Madame Bovery or something like something to that effect then in that sense taking notes makes sense because you genuinely do need to condense the information down and get a hot take on it that you can then memorize for the exams. Whereas if you're studying something like medicine or a science subject you already have tons of revision guides there's already students in the years above who have already written a bunch of notes you've got loads of free stuff available on the internet and so in that context I think taking notes is broadly a waste of time and instead we should be focusing on the more effective and efficient study techniques and speaking of the study techniques the next tip is to focus on understanding first. Now again one of the mistakes the students make which I made a lot when I was a student is to try and just memorize stuff as we go along but the way that we should try and study is broadly we need to understand stuff first and we need to memorize it second. Understanding it basically means being able to explain it to a 12 year old or a five year old or however year old you have a friend or nephew or niece or son or daughter. Basically we want to understand things enough to explain them to a five year old and there's a quote from Einstein which is that if you can't allegedly from Einstein which is that if you can't explain it to a 12 year old you probably just don't understand it well enough. This is also famously called the Feynman technique named after Richard Feynman who apparently was just like a fantastic communicator and really good at physics and stuff but one of his skills was in being able to break down concept topics and explain them to kids and that's what understanding really means. Like it's not really about whether you know kind of five year old understand it but it's more about can you explain it to someone that doesn't really have a baseline level level of knowledge on the topic and can you answer the why why why questions that they're going to inevitably ask. The idea is that for each topic you try and explain it to a five year old in your head or a friend or whatever and when you get to the point where you like you don't know the answer to one of the questions that they're asking and that point you think okay cool that this is where my understanding ends. Let me dive into the textbook or the internet or Wikipedia or YouTube or whatever and let me fill in this gap and now I'll be able to explain it to the five year old again and so over time we're very much focusing on how do we understand this information in the most efficient way possible but then once we've understood it we do actually have to memorize it and thankfully we have three amazing techniques for memorization technique number one is called Active Recall and this is the by far the number one technique in all of effective studying which I've done tons of videos on in the past over the last like five years. The idea behind Active Recall is basically we need to test ourselves. We have this erroneous assumption that to get information into our brain we need to put it into our brain by kind of reading it or consuming it but actually the way memory formation works is that to get information into our brain we actually need to try and retrieve that information from our brain so we read something once we try and understand what the deal with that thing is and then we test ourselves on the thing that we've just read or that we've just understood and then we ideally want to repeat that testing of ourselves further down the line and again this is going to seem hard but there is gallons and gallons of scientific evidence that says that testing yourself on stuff makes it far more likely for that stuff to stick there's a fantastic book as well called Make It Stick which is all about the signs of effective learning and what the authors of that book say is that generally if you are unhappy with your grades or performance in any kind of test any kind of exam it just means that you're not testing yourself enough testing is by far the number one way to improve your score so if you have bad marks test yourself more often more frequently and more so that it feels hard when you test yourself and I guarantee basically that that will lead to an improvement of your score so I had to recall was tip number one for effective memorization the second one is something called space repetition now again space repetition is something I've talked about at Nauseam you might be familiar with it basically the idea is that whenever we remember anything whenever whenever we learn anything our memory for that thing exponentially decays and this is called the forgetting curve which was discovered by a chap called any house in like the 1800s and this is why you have that phenomenon where you read something and then a week later you try and look at it again and you just completely forgotten everything about it because that's that's natural it's not that we are a dumbass and we can't memorize things it's just literally the way that memory works and the whole like some people have a photographic memory is a complete myth like there is no evidence that anyone in the world actually has a proper photographic memory so we all suffer from this and kind of memory decay and the idea behind space repetition is that space repetition interrupt the forgetting curve so we might study a topic on day one and use active recall to test ourselves at the end of the session then our memory is going to decay a bit and maybe the next day we would repeat the testing of ourselves and if we got stuff wrong we would look at our notes then we might repeat it four days later and then maybe a week later and then maybe three weeks later and the idea is that over time as we repeat the testing and as we space that out over time and that is what's going to lead to the forgetting curve being interrupted permanently and we're going to try and help get that information into a long-term memory this is why as well like consistency when it comes to studying over a long period of time is generally a lot better than like random bouts of intensity all in one go because even if you do like 15 minutes per day that is way better than doing like two hours at the end of the week because you're benefiting from that space repetition effect and you're benefiting from the fact that memory formation really gets consolidated when we are sleeping and so in a way the more sleeps you have in between study sessions the more likely you are to more effortlessly retain all that stuff so we've got testing we've got spacing and the third big tip for effective memorizing is something called interleaving again they talk about this a lot in the book make it stick but the ideas that basically we want to be interleaving various different things in a single study session and they've done studies where for example let's say you've got two groups of students and you give one set of students math problems but like you've got them in blocks so like you know all of the you know topic a would be a blog topic b would be a blog and topic c would be a blog and then you take another group of students and you sort of interleave like a b c a b c c b a you know that kind of thing so they're not doing all of one set of problems and one go and they find that the performance of students in the second group the interleaving group is way better than in the first group no one quite knows why this is but again maybe it ties into that thing of like when studying and when learning feels effortful like we haven't yet got like a pattern just to repeat at nausea or at nausea and for a single set of problems when it feels effortful that translates to better memory and so theoretically that helps improve our retention of stuff and so generally we want to be interleaving things so it's like I'm going to do three hours of just renal physiology is generally about shut maybe like one hour of renal physiology followed by some hot physiology followed by some anatomy and then going back to the renal physiology that is probably a more effective way of going about it all right now we come to part three which is technique and tip number one here is to do lots of mock exams now the biggest thing here is to is to recognize that when it comes to studying for stuff the exam is actually not a test of knowledge it's a test of exam performance and yes in an ideal world in a dream world the stuff we'd learn at school and the stuff we'd learn in our degree would would all entirely be relevant and we'd be doing it for the sake of knowledge rather than for the sake of passing an exam in the real world and the way the current education system is designed which is not ideal but in the current world we're not doing it for the sake of knowledge we're doing it partly for the sake of knowledge but mostly to pass the exam to get some sort of qualifying of qualification at the end of it this is even true of medical school you would think that the exams in medical school will help you be a doctor but generally the stuff you get tested on is not the stuff that translates to you being a better doctor at least in written exams compared to clinical stuff and so what that basically means is that when we're studying for stuff we should recognize that we are optimizing our score in a game and that game is the exam we're not worried about just general knowledge across the board well we can't be but again we're going to go directed behavior to do better in exams therefore mock exams like past tests any any way we can get hold of past papers that is often the most high yield thing we can do because again we're tapping into the whole active recall thing and tapping into the idea that testing ourselves it's just the way forward when it comes to memorizing anything but we're also kind of implicitly learning what sort of questions the examiners are asking and what exam technique looks like and if I think back to the exams at university in medical school that I did the best in it was the ones in which I'd done the most mock exam papers so in a way I could get inside the heads of the examiners and kind of predict what questions were going to be asked whenever I say this people in the comments are always like oh my god this is like bad like you should be studying for the sake of knowledge just like yes I agree in an audio world I would be but I also have to pass an exam so you know don't hate the player hate the game as they say technique number two is to use intentional flare now this generally applies to essay exams or exams in which you have to answer questions in long form and basically the more flare you can add to that the more interesting it is to the examiner I spent a year supervising medical physiology at Cambridge University and so I read dozens and dozens of essays and inevitably the ones that I felt were the best were the ones where there was some level of flare whether it was just even just like nice handwriting or you know pretty diagrams or someone adding like a really interesting introduction that had a interesting take on the subject of like how was the sodium pump discovered if someone adds like a flary interesting kind of introduction it really makes me as the examiner feel like oh hello this is kind of interesting this is unusual especially you know if you're doing one of these public exams where the examiner is a reading like hundreds of scripts in a given day the more flare you can add and the more you can stand out in their mind in a good way hopefully the more likely they are to give you a decent mark and I'm going to let you know in a secret a lot of examiners don't actually read your whole essay read all of your work a lot of them get quite lazy a lot of them get a bit like demotivated especially as the day progresses and so the easier you can make it the more you can make it look as if you were the sort of person who deserves a high mark the more likely you are to get that high mark again this is not ideal you would think especially in like things like medical school and all school and stuff that the examiner is reading every single word of your essay but if you've ever tried reading like a hundred essays in a go it's just genuinely really really really really hard to actually read every single word so basically if we can front load the flare and if we can make if we can structure our essays and make them look pretty that really does go a long way in creating this halo effect in the eyes of the examiners and that generally translates to a better mark for ourselves so you know it's just about the packaging it's about the marketing it's about the presentation of stuff it's not only about the content and tip number three for technique is in general you should try and bank as many points as you possibly can with coursework there's a prize to some university subjects to a lot of school subjects in GCC and A level or O level and A level but over the cold these days but when there is the option to do coursework throughout the year which contributes to your final grade and it's generally a good thing to do because it's kind of scary when 100% of your grade rests on that final exam so the more you can put flare and vibes and good stuff into your coursework especially if that's an option the easier the final exam becomes all right that brings us two part number four which is friends and tip number one here is to really study with friends this is something that most people don't do because they're like oh my friends are distracting but really what you want to do is you want to find a good group of friends where you vibe with one another and you're all motivated to study for the exams together you don't even have to be doing the same subject when I was in my second year of medical for example I had friends who were doing like history, law, medicine, philosophy, maths and we would all go to the same library and study together and we'd be using the Pomodoro technique together so we'd study for 25 minutes then we'd take a five minute break and we created this WhatsApp group that we called the Pomodoro Society which is still going to this day because we're all still kind of friends and yes you might take a little bit of a hit to your productivity but if I think back to my university experience hey I think I was much more motivated when studying with friends but be it also just made the whole thing much more fun and if I'd been just stuck in my room on my own I would have had a lot a lot less fond memories of university especially exam term than I did because I was in the library hanging out with friends and we'd go out to lunch after a few hours of revision tip number two for studying with friends is to test each other this is the thing I used to do a lot with my medical school friends when I was in clinical schools so the final three years of med school at Cambridge University and the idea there is one of us would learn a topic and then we would test the other people on it or for example if I were studying a topic I would ask someone to test me on it like when you're studying with friends especially if you have a friend like in our case it was a friend called Paul Paul just kind of knew everything and so the temptation is there but like hey Paul I don't know anything about the thyroid can you just tell me about the thyroid that's kind of bad because it's just passively trying to absorb information from another student whereas the way we do it is like right Paul I don't know anything about the thyroid can you test me on it and then you can fill in the gaps and so Paul would be like okay cool what are the common causes of a lump in the neck or a common causes of like a painful goit or whatever and then it'd be like oh crap I don't know oh I can think I can remember this I can think I can remember that and so we're actively testing ourselves and testing our friends and then our friends are hopefully filling in the gaps or if there's a gap that no one knows then someone can google it and we can all like learn together and tip number three for this is to read your friends essays so when I was at university again like me and my friends would we get together we formed a shared google drive and instead of all of us preparing the same essays that we would then kind of try and memorize for the exam we kind of split up the workload so that I was doing three Catherine was doing three Jake was doing three one he was doing three Paul was doing three counting three and so on and so by the end of it like we like each individual would do three essays worth of work but then we'd have access to like 30 essays from the other 10 medics in our college and this was a great system right because it means that we are distributing the workload a lot of university revision all of school revision is kind of inefficient because a lot of people are kind of doing the same thing and he Paul resources and if you share your notes and stuff you can benefit a lot from the economy of scale in terms of writing essays and planning stuff out. Now obviously if in the exam you are trying to regurgitate a friends essay word for word that is probably bad it's probably going to be picked up on and that's not what I'm endorsing what I'm endorsing is use your friends notes share resources amongst yourselves and then when you're doing stuff you can add your own flare and your invites to it to make it your own. And finally we have part number five which is balance. At tip number one here is to have some sort of workspace. I really like going to libraries in my first year of med school I tried working in my room and I really failed at working in my room because it always got distracted because my computer was there and because the music could be on and because the bed was right next door and so if I just wanted to sleep it would just be too easy to fall asleep whereas from second year onwards I started going to the library and then I made it this routine to go to the library every morning after breakfast to do some work and when you're in that zone when you're in that zone of silence maybe you've got your like study with music playing in the background link in the video description if you want to check it out and Spotify there's just something about that that really helps in terms of focus. This is a thing that I'm finding these days as I'm working on writing a book about productivity which is that like when I have a specific space like some kind of routine that in the morning I'm going to wake up I'm going to go to the gym and then I'm going to sit down for three hours and try and write my book. That is when I make the most progress whereas when my routine goes out of whack and I try and write here and there and everywhere else then it's just actually genuinely hard to to focus and so I'm big on building some kind of routine and some kind of workspace that feels productive that helps us build those healthy habits for kind of maintaining that consistency and enjoyment over a long period of time. Tip number two in balance is to definitely have time for unwinding. There is this like over glamorization that happens especially at university especially in things like medical schools where people are like hey I work so hard I don't have time to sleep I work so hard I put on all nighter and it's generally bad obviously balances the way forward I think students these days now no longer compete to see who can work the hardest because that kind of used to be a thing back in my day when I was in my youth very you know it's all about balance it's all about having hobbies having stuff that you can do to unwind I found it useful to actually schedule that time into my calendar because when you're enjoying work and when you're kind of turning into a game which is which is what I was big about when you're enjoying it it can be very easy to just be like oh I'm having so much fun that I just can't be bothered to I don't know go to the gym or I do the sports stuff but genuinely I think scheduling time for unwinding in the calendar is it's really helpful I would have like game of thrones night with my friends we'd all hang out every week and watch game of thrones we'd do a bunch of like sports stuff together you know playing Batmanton playing squash that kind of thing even in the midst of exam season and it was actually in exam season though first took up squash for the first time in my second year and we played on average like an hour a day as like an exam break and that stress buster stress reliever semi relaxing semi competitive thing just really helped in terms of making me feel more motivated to actually study while I was studying and also to feel more tired at the end of the day so I could have a good night sleep because sleep is when all these memories and stuff gets consolidated and tip number three for balance is to really focus on enjoying the journey and not being so fixated on the destination this is the advice that I give to a bunch of students who come to me for advice these days like when you're a student it can be very easy to defer your happiness until after the exams or until after your degree or until you get a job and one of the most saddening things I hear from medical students is oh you know this I don't really enjoy med school this med school thing is really hard but once I become a doctor it will all have been worth it and always like oh that's like a dangerous way of living life because eight med school is genuinely more fun than being a doctor when you're a doctor you're obligated to be in and you have a job and the stress is different to the stress of being a medical student but also like you know being a student is supposed to be the best time of your life it's like your prime you've got loads of friends around you and never again in your life will you be in an environment where you have so much spare time and you have so many friends all around you and so really focus on enjoying that process and the way I think of it is we want to try and enjoy each day on its own merit rather than being fixated on like you know this next rung of the ladran I will be happy when I dot dot dot so really it's all about the journey rather than the destination yes we want to optimize for studying for exams and we want to optimize for doing well and doing well and on degrees and all that kind of stuff but really you know if we're not enjoying the journey along the way you know we want to try and do our best in joints journey along the way because otherwise we're just like screen ourselves over by kind of throwing away these like potentially best years of our life for the sake of an end goal and something when you get to the end goal that you realize are actually I kind of wish I'll enjoy myself more along the way now if you've got it at this point in the video then firstly thank you very much for watching but you're also probably the sort of person who appreciates leveling up the own thinking and problem solving skills which is why you might like to check out the sponsor of this video which is brilliant if you haven't heard brilliant is an online courses platform that has interactive online courses in maths science and computer science of course is a fantastic and genuinely entertaining and insightful to work through and the way they teach stuff is all based on a very first principle approach to learning it's like they would teach you a concept and then they would do it like they would find some sort of interactive way to integrate that concept into a question and then you would try and solve the problem and then you learn the next concept along the way and this is exactly the format that we used to have at Oxford and Cambridge in terms of supervisions and tutorials with like you know two of us and one kind of tutor or expert on the subject matter they would teach you a little bit of something then you try some work it was like very kind of interactive first principles way of learning a subject my favorite courses in brilliant are the ones on computer science when I was applying to med school I was actually torn between med school and computer science and I'm going for medicine at the end which was a great decision but I always kind of thought I kind of really wish I also knew more about this computer science stuff and so in brilliant they've got fantastic courses you know the introduction to computer science introduction to algorithms introduction to learning how to code and Python if that sounds up your street and you want to level up your problem solving skills and learn the maths science and computer science behind what makes the world tick head over to gradient.org forward slash alley and the first 200 people to click that link will get 20% off the annual premium subscription so thank you so much for watching this video
