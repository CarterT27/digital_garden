https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpM4QXb9lhk
In today's episode, we learn how to save lives in the Immediate Life Support course run by the Resuscitation Council UK. This was a super useful day on our Emergency Medicine placement. After the course finished, some of the junior doctors run a teaching session for us in the doctors' mess, and we finish the day with a game of Pandemic Legacy and some excellent home-cooked food. Enjoy xx

## Transcript
 Hey guys, welcome back to the channel. It's week two of the emergency medicine placement and we're on an all-day course for immediate life support Where we go over the ABCD approach to assessing on-world patients this morning We talked through that and we did a lot of scenarios where we had one of us one of the medics students at one of the nurses kind of being paired up And I'm taking care of a patient So I had a patient who had asthma attack other one and relaxes. There was another. There was a mic on the infarction So it's been quite fun dealing with these things This afternoon, we're going to be doing like cardiac arrest in areas where we're going to be and it's pretending the mannequin has a cardiac arrest and like shocking them So we're going to put it to that for learning a lot. It's going to be amazing Hello again guys. It's now about quarter-plus seven in the evening for about half-five onwards We had a really good teaching session with two junior doctors just going over management of emergencies like diabetic keto astasis asthma and a Flaxis this sort of stuff. So that was really good. Now it's about quarter-plus seven Schillin and Flora are cooking for us. They're making some kind of vegetarian curry thing which would be good And I think in the meantime, we're going to play a cheehygamer pandemic legacy and we'll see you in a bit Alright guys, we're back in the flats pandemic legacy is like pandemic, but each time you play the game the game changes So we're on like month five and we're just planning to kind of play this for the whole year because like new stuff It's added and everything the situation is intensified countries that hesitant to turn troops on their loved ones We need to control their spread or the world will go its darkness Don't let the other diseases grow our checks or we will have an end to all the situation each time we play there are test instructions Like it says open box number three or open stick a pack in number five and that changes the game and adds a different kind of rules and different dimensions to it So it's like the same game, but modified over the course of the year, which is pretty awesome and feels like you're in a middle of a online role playing game Where we like the scientists to find out gets this like evil disease thing You're the sweetest thing I ever hear, just sweetest thing I ever hear
