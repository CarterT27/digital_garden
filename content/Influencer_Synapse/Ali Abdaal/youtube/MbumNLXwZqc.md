## Transcript
 Hey guys, welcome back to the vlog. We are on the Jurassic Coast in Dorset on a wilderness medicine trip. The final one of the year, the final one ever and we've just been working up at 7 o'clock in the morning for a scenario. We were in the Alps and like an avalanche in the house and then the building broke and then people got the legs broken and someone was unconscious and all of that stuff. This is a main thing and it just takes start to the trip already. And now he... Woo! I'm just curious. It's like that, they love it. Alright, so this is the Jurassic Coast. We go on holiday to other countries to see places like this. And then this stuff is just, you know, on our doorstep. There's a happy man of his dogs who can have a paradise. Now don't believe him, he's a lion and a sugarcoder. Just wait until break the down. Say what you have to say, but don't forget to leave the motor on. You turn around, but you will be gone. You guys are on a day five of a hike in the Central American wilderness. Ben, you are first medic. Where's that? The stairs get nice. We'll color it as well. If it's not purple, it's no good work. Is there a lemon? Ooh, this is nice, there you go. I don't know if it's perfect. Yeah, perfect. Where's the power? Oh, it's just like I've done here. I think something will fit me. I think it was the same? Oh, shit. Tom, we need to start the van now. And what's here for us? Marcus has been bitten by a snake. He's got some severe pain in his car. The blood coming out of that snake bite as well. We need to completely immobilise a patient. Don't really want to interfere with the wound or anything. All right, it looks like Rachel's been bitten by another snake. Maybe the same snake. And now we're hobbling away from the snake in festive grass. You said that. Oh, lift it. I'm just going to lift it slightly, okay? Hey, eggs in the area. Oh, I like everyone. That's not to get panicked in a emergency situation. Just do things that are calming. Very good. But that's pretty good. Three in a row. Oh my god, that was really, really, really cold. I don't know how these guys are still in there. Oh, maybe it's a lack of traffic. Through this storm, I will hold you keep you warm. And for this, there's law worth code. It's very, very pretty. You've got a green tini curry with Obajene Paula Flower. Baby corn and sea peas. And then we're going to add some rice. And we've got some chocolate and banana for dessert. And why have you chosen to combine these specific ingredients to make such a masterpiece? Well, you think about it. And the softness of the betonette squash with the hardness of the cauliflower and the sweetness of the peppers. It just all comes together and it truly tastes delicious. Look at the fairy light face. Oh, that's just so good. This is the cutest dinner I've ever been to. I feel special. It feels like the truth is very well. It's food in really, really, really, really. Really, really good. Yeah, it's great. I've been going to the right. Okay, so we just had dinner. What we're doing now is that we set up the barbecue and we are making a holes in bananas. And then filling up those holes with things like strawberries, chocolate, marshmallows. And then those are going to go on the barbecue. Are we going to barbecue your own little bananas? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. It's going to be interesting. It's been a full day of sun and fun. It's been great. Incredible boys and girls. No, it's been great. We've had walks, we've had beaches, we've had swimming. You're at cheesy chips. It's a castle, isn't it? It's moved on for me, isn't it? I know, it's interesting. Well, the next one is the society, the best society in the world, because you get to go. And these amazing retreat from these amazing places, but also you get to have amazing walks outside, you get to learn, exciting, amazing medicine outside the hospital, which is incredible. And you get incredible beaches, amazing teachers, bachelor and Rachel, yeah, there you go. It says, as well, we're going to call it a day for tonight. We're finishing off by, we've got a big circle with all 22 of us around and we're playing this really weird part game. Goodnight, see you in the morning.
