Check out the designs over at dbrand - https://dbrand.com/shop/palettes

A few weeks ago I tweeted about wanting to design my own MacBook skins. Fast forward a few weeks and after a couple of conversations with the robots over at @dbrand that ambition has now come true with the Palettes Collection. Thanks to everyone that tagged @dbrand in that initial tweet and of course thanks to the @dbrand robots for getting this sorted so quickly. Enjoy x

## Transcript
 Hey friends welcome back to the channel so over the last few years I've had literally hundreds of comments from people asking me where do I get my MacBook skins from. Now back in the day I had to search far and wide to find this exact aesthetic that I wanted but a few weeks ago I thought what if I could actually just design my own line of MacBook skins and phone accessories. So with this business idea in mind I did the only sensible thing I could which is that I asked Twitter. I asked if we wanted to design and sell our own custom MacBook skins who would be the best company to work with and I had a ridiculous number of replies all mentioning the same company. And even a reply from MKBHD himself saying there's only one answer. So who the hell are debrand? Well it's the same company that got into a lawsuit with Sony over some PS5 side panels and then just release their own side panels a few days later and challenge Sony to sue them. They're the same guys who bake phones into cakes as part of YouTube sponsorship. They're the phone in my cake. And they go super viral on Twitter with their roasting replies to poor innocent people. They also happen to make some really great products and they've worked with a bunch of creators in the past including MKBHD and PewDiePie and Linus Tech Tips. So you can imagine my joy when they replied to my tweet and then slid into my DMs and so began this absolute dream collaboration with debrand. From that point I shared a mood board of design ideas and kind of told their robots what sort of aesthetic that I liked and they took those ideas away and they came back with five absolutely incredible designs. Once we locked those in it was then time for manufacturing. And by the way this is the first time that debrand have ever allowed anyone an inside look into how their processes operate. Step one is that these designs get printed on an absolutely enormous printer which prints off pages that are eight feet wide and hundreds and hundreds of feet long. Then the robots are debrand take that enormous piece of paper and they put it through this fancy proprietary eliminating machine thing. And this is a fancy proprietary mat laminar that protects the design and also protects the devices that it's on. Anyway once we've got this enormous piece of laminated paper the next step is cutting and there's these autonomous machines that work around the clock to cut six foot by six foot cuts of every single design. And these machines are ensuring that all the designs that get cut are absolutely perfectly matched to the specification of the device and question. And then once the design has been cut then step four is that they store them in their enormous warehouse in Toronto where they've got tens of thousands of inventory bins. And every single order is made in-house in Toronto and every single order is shipped from their facility in Toronto as well. And so there we have the pallets collection which is a collaboration between me and debrand and you can find it on their website right now. Palets it's like light mode but good. And this is all the website looks like it's pretty sick. Palets the early of dollar collection it's like light mode but good. When Dr turned YouTube early of the hour arrived at our HQ he brought with him five skin designs. He also brought heaps of advice on how we could live happier healthier and more productive lives. We couldn't send him back to England fast enough good thing he left his designs with us. That's a little bit rude. Also I can just say this website is absolutely sick. I have a little bit of background in web design myself and I just like saw this. I was like oh my god this is actually just so good. And so here are the designs. The first one is Solstice which is my personal favorite and the one I now have on all of my devices. And the inspiration for this was the idea of sort of ice and fire the sort of cold and warm and kind of these marriage of these two things. I just think it looks sick. I've been taking this out for the last few days and everyone who's seen my phone or my AirPods or my laptop has been like whoa where did you get that case from and I'm like haha you've got away until next week when it'll be announced. Next up we have Magma where you know unsurprisingly we're going for this sort of fire-themed aesthetic so this is what the MacBook skin looks like and the cases for the AirPods and phone cases coming this like super sick box where you open up the box and you've got the skin or the case and we also have the airport cases which means they look a little bit more interesting than the plain or white case and if you want you can mix and match your colors or you can do what I've done and just get everything of the whole set which is just nice. Design number three is Sea Breeze this is this nice dark blue kind of themed obviously going off to the sea. Now we have the phone case that shares a similar aesthetic and then the airport cover as well if that tickles your boat. Our next we have alpine which is sort of this more neutral colored mountainous type theme. A bunch of people learn to on our team really like the alpine aesthetic so if that floats your boat a bit more you might like the alpine one. And finally we have probably my second favorite one which is neopolitan where we're going for this sort of pink, creamy light blue kind of aesthetic and as always we have this available for phones and AirPods and MacBooks and other things as well. Now if you want to check these out there's really two products that you can get you can get a skin which is what this is over here which is basically a sticker that sticks onto your device and that's nice it's not really going to protect it realistically but it just looks really nice and I've had this on my laptop for the last several days and every time I take it out I'm just filled with joy as to how beautiful this looks or for phones and AirPods and stuff you can get a case which is the skin combined with this military grade protection case thing so you could drop it and nothing bad will hopefully happen to your phone. Now at the moment for this launch we've got five different designs and 28 support devices including the new iPhone 14's so when my iPhone 14 Pro arrives in the next few days I'll be installing these cases on there along with the airport generation two all that fun stuff and if you want to get one of these but your specific device is not yet supported then you can go on the website and you can suggest your device and if Dbrand getting off orders of that device they'll send you an email and they'll let you know when it's ready to order for your specific device. Now this is genuinely one of the dream collaborations that I've ever worked with. I saw that when they worked with MKBHD and released the icons pack it was just so incredible and the fact that Dbrand made these incredible products and are also just cool to work with and just these designs look amazing and there's honestly part of me that can't believe this is actually happens especially because it just happens so quickly from sending out that initial tweet and just being like hey there's a good company to work with to them contacting us and then us having this working relationship together it's just really nice and pretty cool yeah if you told me a few years ago that I'd be designing my own custom MacBook skins and working with a company like Dbrand I want to believe it it's just really cool so massive thank you to everyone who tagged Dbrand in the Twitter replies and got their attention massive thank you to Dbrand for working with us on this drop hopefully it will continue to work with them in the meantime we have these super nice skins which you can buy that we linked in down below and you can check them out on Dbrand's website if you like oh and if you do get one of these I'd love it if you can post a photo on Instagram or on Twitter and tag me and Dbrand and it that would be awesome we'd love to repose some of the stuff and we'd love to see what you guys do with these designs so that's it for this video thank you so much for watching do check out these designs if you're interested in them and have a great rest of day bye bye
