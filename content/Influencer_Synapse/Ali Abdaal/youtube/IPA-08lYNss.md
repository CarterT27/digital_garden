https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPA-08lYNss
This is my first semi-proper tech review. We're unboxing and getting some test footage from the Zhiyun Crane v2 camera gimbal / stabiliser. This is a pretty great, reasonably priced gimbal that I'm really looking forward to playing around with some more. Enjoy xx

## Transcript
 Hey guys, welcome back to the channel. If you're new here, my name is Ali, I'm a finally a medical student at Cambridge University and because I've always wanted to be a tech YouTuber, I'm going to start reviewing tech. So today we're going to be talking about the Union Crane V2. So I've never used a gimbal before, so this is going to be quite exciting for me. What we're going to do is that I'm going to unbox it very quickly, get it set up and then we'll just jump into a lot of stabilized footage of stuff in my room, stuff in the garden, it's a beautiful summer's day and then I'll ask one of my friends to use the gimbal and film me playing the guitar and singing a song. So we're going to get a wide variety of shots, as always there's going to be timestamps to absolutely everything in the description below. But now let's just unbox this thing and let's get started because this is really exciting. This box is very, very nice. All right, so inside the box, we have another box, get rid of that. It's got the smell of like, you know, like an industrial, oh, this feels incredible. Oh crap, I think I opened it the wrong way around. Okay, now for the moment of truth. Oh, hello, this is shiny. So it comes with some random CD, is it a CD? Surely not. No one used to use any of them. Oh, hello, this feels nice. So I'm kind of battery charger. I've got a few cables, don't care. A few random screws. Oh, yes, here we go. Here we go. Here we go. This is the gimbal supposedly. So what it looks like. Oh, no, it does come with batteries. These are massive batteries. Oh, here we go. Here's another button. Oh, oh my goodness. It feels like autonomous. We need to mount a camera on it. And here is the trusty Sony A6000 with the Sony 50mm F1.8 lens. I love this lens. I love this camera. This is like the camera. I recommend everyone kit because it's cheap enough. Amazing. I really have no idea how this works. Oh, all right. So the camera needs to sit like this. Oh, oh, oh, there we go. All right. All right. Okay. Oh, this is a really cool. Okay. Oh, hello. This is very cool. Um, let's now get some stabilizer shots of stuff in my room. I'm just so excited by this, because this is just cool. You know what, I'm going to call up one of my mates and ask him to play the piano. Jake. All right. So we've brought Jake up from downstairs. Hey, say hi. Jake is finally a medic as well. And he's going to be playing stuff on the piano. And then we're going to film him for Jake. Would you like to take it away? Okay. So we've got some shots of Jake playing piano. Now he's going to hold onto the gimbal. And then from a completely kind of, he's never used one of these before. He's going to film me playing the piano. We'll see how it goes. All right. All right. All right, Jake, can we get you back on the piano? Now we're going to get Jake back on the piano. We're going to switch to the 35 millimeter and see if that makes a difference. Okay. We're going to turn it on. Oh, it works. All right. I can come around this side and do some shots of this bit of the guitar. Watch the sunset over the castle. All right. So that was a guitar test. And now we're going to end with. I'm going to grab the gimbal. I'm going to go outside film some shots of like trees and stuff. I will see what that looks like. And I'll see you in just a moment for like a wrap-up of, you know, what it was like using the June crane V2. Thank you very much, Jake. Feel free to do whatever you like now. This is why ND filters are really, really useful. Okay. Fine. That'll do, I think. All right. So we're in the garden. This is our university accommodation. We're going to get some stabilized shots of stuff. We're going to stick to 25 frames per second. Like I said, I really don't really know how to use this. Just been playing with it for the last hour or so. And yeah, I'll see what happens here is some nice shots of the garden. You First thought of the June crane V2. This is really cool. It feels like having a super power almost just being able to get stabilized footage. If any of you feel like experience with handheld footage, you know just how annoying it is to actually keep stable. This is really good. One thing I would say is it is quite heavy. I've been kind of trying it out pretty 100, but my super nature and the flexors of my forearm are feeling like feeling the burn right now because it is quite heavy. And this definitely does take a little bit of practice to get used to. I still haven't quite got the hang of it. I think what I might do is just kind of watching TV or something just kind of have the gimbal in my hand and practice various moves of there. So yeah, that was the first look of the June crane V2. I hope you enjoyed the video. I'm trying to become a tech youtuber sort of, but like I don't know. I didn't take this too seriously. It's kind of had a bit of fun with it. So let me know in the comments what you thought of this review. And once I'm more of a pro at using this thing, I'll be able to actually actually maybe do an in depth review. But that was the first look. I hope you enjoyed it. If you liked the video, please give it a thumbs up. If you haven't subscribed to the channel, please consider doing so. Have a lovely day. I'll see you in the next video. Bye bye.
