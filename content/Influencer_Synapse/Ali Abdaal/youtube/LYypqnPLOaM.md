# Reapplying to Medicine (UK) - A comprehensive guide
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYypqnPLOaM
In this interview, I talk to Anton, a 6th year medical student at Emmanuel College, Cambridge. Anton got 4 rejections the first time he applied, but he tactically worked on his application and got an offer from Cambridge University after taking a gap year. In this video, Anton addresses a load of questions that you‚Äôll hopefully find helpful if you‚Äôre reapplying to medicine.

## Transcript
 Hey guys, welcome back to the channel. If you're new here, my name is Ali and I'm a junior doctor working in Cambridge and this is the very first video in a new series called Medical Mondays So basically when I started this channel initially, I thought the audience would be almost exclusively medicine applicants and medical students But now thanks to like some of the videos, it seems to have expanded a lot beyond that So I still want to be making like really niche videos for medical students and medicine applicants, but I don't want to kind of confuse everyone else to watch this channel So all of those videos are going to be shot into Mondays into this new series called Medical Mondays So with that intro out of the way, this video is a really long and really niche video aimed exclusively at people who have applied to medicine in the UK And who didn't get any offers or who didn't make their offers And this is like a 30 minute long interview with my friend Anton. It was filmed a few months ago I completely forgot that it existed But we took through quite a lot of really good stuff Anton reapplied to medicine He didn't get any offers the first time around But then he got into Cambridge a second time around So he's got some pretty legit advice on what you can do if you're in that position of not getting any offers or not making your offer So that's my intro. Welcome to Medical Mondays And yeah, I hope you enjoyed this interview and everything of course is going to be in the timestamps in the description below So yeah, let's roll this fancy new intro and we'll get into me and Anton from like six months ago Enjoy Anton is a good friend of mine He's a fellow finally a yoga guy in manual college And we're doing this interview because Anton has an interesting story in that he got into medicine second time around And we were chatting about this the other day when I was preparing another video about what to do If you don't have any offers that'll be linked up there and down here and everywhere Anton seemed like really had some good practical actionable advice And I think from someone who's actually got an intake and time round I thought it would be really good for him to kind of chat to you guys about it Sorry, that would be absolutely fine, I mean hopefully it's helpful for you guys too Great, so could we start if you want my inch sharing how you felt when you didn't get any offers First time round Yeah, I mean it was absolutely getting you know It takes a while because I kind of trickle in slowly I've actually got one interview so I kind of had that one It was notting them and the rest was straight rejections I was just absolutely devastated They when the final one came through saying no you haven't got in And I remember thinking oh god, what am I going to do? What am I going to do for the rest of this year? What am I going to do for the rest of my life? Is it worth? It made some worth it I think there was a lot of self-doubt that came in originally Like how am I good enough? You know if they see something in me that I didn't see originally You know I'm just not going to be cut out for this course But you know I think friends family kind of pull you through Telling you that actually you know you are good this these things happen And I think you just do have to remember that you're going to get knocks in life And you just got to get it back up and get it back out there Essentially But yeah, it was absolutely getting give yourself a week to kind of mope around The thing guard this is awful And then think right what do I do about it? You've got to get back on the practical I think the first question you've got to ask yourself really is Actually do I want to do medicine Because if you do the next year is going to be quite tough And there's going to be a lot for you to do You know I had friends who did the same as me Got four rejections And then they actually decided that medicine wasn't for that I'm going to offer to do other things And I think that's fair enough for some people Definitely wasn't the case for me And I guess if you're watching this you're probably one of those people But I think so know you know what I definitely want to do medicine Yeah initially terrible I feel crap You get over it Thanks for sharing so it sounds like yeah it's pretty terrible feeling initially But yeah and you give yourself a week to mope and then you Make a plan Yeah, so yeah It's definitely about kind of getting on top of it getting a plan really So can you tell us about your plan and what advice you give to people in who might be in that position? Yeah, I guess I look to do Because it's actually you know it must be It's a few months before the end of the academic year So you actually have more than a year If you kind of have you got about six months before the next application process Roughly you know that you know personal statements You're going to come around next September And it's actually kind of April Time later so you're going to find out and lost Even not got in You've got a few months there You're going to think What did I have wrong with my application That that is you know I can I can change that I can get better In this time and Quite useful thing that we did I went to my school went to my senior tutor and said What's wrong with my application and he went okay We'll email the universities you've applied to You know you apply for four only got one reply But that one reply was invaluable It was from Leeds And they sent me back a sheet of paper that essentially broke down What I my application it they scored you out of thirty or forty points I think it was and you're to get thirty five or more to get an interview And I got thirty four so I knew that I was actually pretty close to To even getting to interview I just had to change a few bits Improve make a few tweaks here and there And the my main problem is my personal statement Everyone's is going to be different slightly blind But but having said that almost all the points We're available for personal statement It was out I think forty I think it was and only it was like ten wrong academics About twenty five wrong person statement So It's definitely where you can gain the most marks having a good person statement Okay, so what kind of stuff did they ask you to put in your personal statement that you didn't have first time round Yeah Good question I think the experiences were mainly With a big to the difference And what I mean by that is All that stuff that that who've jumping that I thought was rubbish The first time round I was like oh you don't need to go and shadow a doctor for twelve months You don't need to have gone into it And old people's home You know a care home Going to help children with learning disability He's anything like I thought what a lot of rubbish You know that's not really necessary And I think it only took me until actually being in medical school To realise quite why they do that And looking back on it now I see why they want you to have done that And so if you're sitting there thinking God you know that is rubbish and it's boring And you know what my learning from what my gaining from going I think realistically you're probably not learning a lot It's definitely not learning medicine What they're doing is they're asking you to show that you're willing to sacrifice You're own free time And you're own kind of social hours that sort of thing To do something that you can't understand Now does really want you to do this to be honest with yourself You don't sit there and go yeah can't wait To go in And into the care home And just serve tea It's boring You know you get there It's usually you're actually a fun You know what I found it was It was actually a good idea It was a good idea It was a good idea I love that I got there So don't be prof by doing these things It's a good fun really But there's a lot of drag going into them And feel like you're going to think of fully yourself Or your tea on someone that sort of thing But what they want you to do is just show that you're willing to sacrifice Your time, your energy effort Sort of sort of thing On something that you don't want to do Because actually medicine is a lot about that I'm sure I'll tell you There's a lot of times that I've been asked to do A rectil examination And I thought to myself This is not what I wanted to be doing But you know that's what medicine's about It's about sacrificing and you know how many times Have we had to give up weekends It's actually events For something And I did like whatever And that's just it always does proof of that So like it's it sounds like all of this This whole work experience just this jumping through Good thing I've actually done a video about how to answer the question About what do you learn your work experience Where I make the point that I personally didn't find work experience That useful because you don't really learn anything Medicine related Yeah, but I guess what Anton is saying is that Actually the point of work experience Isn't necessarily that you're learning anything in particular It's at the very least just to show them that You have thought about this enough And you're dedicated to studying medicine Enough to jump through all these hoops And given the tens of thousands of people applying to medicine Having that as like a barrier to entry That you know we need someone to have done some kind of work experience Some kind of volunteering Some kind of I don't know charity work a long period of time That's a good way of screening certain people out Because everyone is going to have good grades You know you need other things to block people From getting into medicine as bad as that thing Exactly I think that's exactly Much better said than I could at least I think just on on those points So some other things that my personal statement I think second time around was better Some of the opportunities that came up In the year off I had And also what you do with your year I don't think it reflects particularly well on you If you just go and take daddy's money and fly off somewhere And spend the year away And they don't reflect particularly well on that In why I feel like they wouldn't be anyway I wouldn't got a job Because I thought well I'm going to need money And actually a lot of my interviews after that They quite liked that They were asking me How's my fine working in the bar? I just picked a job I got quite lucky actually And I think it's another thing you could definitely try I approached my local GP And asked if they had any jobs and I ended up doing an admin role In a GP practice Which they thought was really good I was actually doing audits Which I mean we didn't start doing until kind of four year of medical school But actually it turns out they're quite important And I've done about 50 of them because they just went to work Where's we had to do like one a year So they look very popular But I just stumbled on that It was accidental But I'd say you know going to do something with your time You've got a year As Ali said planning preparing for it Knowing that you've got a year To think to kind of do something with I went away at the end of it But once I've done a few other bits as well You can't just run off Go and go see the world Because you've got some time Make sure that if you're going for medicine You've got to make your application good And that means getting a job So you've got some life experience They're quite like that I mean doing this work experience And volunteering And making sure your personal statement is well written You've got a lot of time to think about it Okay so in terms of sort of tactical advice That we've discussed so far We've talked about number one It's been about a week moving And then get over it And like you know make a plan Yeah You know to try and get feedback from universities If you can I think the really specific feedback that you've got from Leeds Really helped your application So yeah They're basically told you everything they want to I think that's the statement Which is perhaps currencies of that I mean I got my school to do it So I don't exactly who they email But I think it was the admissions office Okay And I guess they say it's more legit coming from your school Yeah Then from a random person being on Yeah I mean if you're not willing to try it Well there's no harm But yeah the school was much much better I actually go Oh well I got my UCL rejection I emailed them specifically asking for feedback And they gave really good feedback Which I will talk about some other time And we've talked about things you can do To improve your personal statement So just on that note Anton's got his both copies of his personal statement With him Would you mind just taking us through Some of the things that were different Between the rejected one and the accepted one Because you went into a couple of second time So you must have something right There was a lot of differences I suppose As I've mentioned before The main one being The amount of experiences that I had So And just as a kind of evidence of I'm sure I had to bring all this up for you to see My kind of third paragraph in my unsuccessful And it's all about how I helped I kind of did some tutoring with a friend Actually I've evidence out a few lines Just because they were the personal to me But it was like a whole paragraph on this Because it was one of my main experiences Whereas in my successful one It became a single line In kind of the fourth or fifth paragraph That just said yeah I drew the friend Because I had so little room at this point Because of all my other experiences That first paragraph You know you start off with your intro paragraph right Just saying some kind of cheesy line About how much you want to do medicine And you can see mine But they actually changed quite a lot You can see how I just padded it out I realised that the intro is actually a lot more important than just a line My ambition in life is to do something meaningful To be able to look back at the end The proud of what I've achieved No profession other than medicine Will look adequately for field that ambition for me That was it And then in your legit one The updated version you could you read that for us And then session on the screen My ambition in life is to accomplish something meaningful To be able to look back at the end That would be proud of what I've achieved This goal together with my love of science Eagerness to learn and desire to care for others Motivates me to pursue a career in medicine Initially interested in medicine came when I studied as history Give me an insight to the work and influence of many great individuals So just ignore the symbol of ice And ambrosia pyro The pioneer to use obligatory tools Events the crow's beak These people inspired me And I hope one day to be involved in research That's something as influential I can think of no more Of no more noble or honorable profession It will be a privilege to practice medicine Oh yes That's a great idea That's a great idea So that's just an example of the introduction And if it's all right with you If you don't mind if we put them up Of course you will like link in the description So you can just have a look at the before to the after You don't be ripping me off But please have a look And see if you can pull in a thing for yourself Even just things like structure You can see that I've gone With quite a standard I think I don't know how these presumably done a video of you about We've done so We've kind of intro And then talking about experiences You can see the difference between the experiences The first one I'm panning out as much as possible Because I've done very little I've been to a GP for a few days And I've chatted a surgeon I think And I made it into like a very wordy sentence That was like all I've done So I'll read it I also chatted a laparoscopic general surgeon And coached a gym hospital three days Whereas the other one I've just kind of gone Yeah and I saw a surgeon It was much quicker Because I was just running out of room Because I had a lot of things I actually did a few other bits That are not even in my personal statement That I thought were quite useful Because they came up in interviews as well I went found lots of unusual experiences Like Shannon and Corna Which was quite interesting I just did it for like two days Yeah And it's not something that you traditionally think of as medicine But we'll know now We get quite a lot Actually Corna is really important It's a sort of de-treatification And they quite like that I found something unusual to see You know And didn't even fit into my personal statement I don't think they might have been a line of karma But I don't think you did So Yeah Anything more you'd like to ask from the person Statement When we were talking earlier You mentioned that Being 18 helps with some of your experiences Yeah I just found that When I was trying to Get work experience in the hospital Originally I was denied Because I wasn't 18 And I don't know if that's a national rule or whatever That was just where I'm from That's what I said But I was able to kind of get Once I turned 18 I guess for some of you if you're born late in the year That might not be that useful in some ways It might become a bit late But I was able to actually get a role In the hospital I've working in the X-ray department And I think that really helped actually to see I was actually able to help not just shadow around Someone I was actually in the X-ray department Helping move films because they still used to film It would be played such a Two-in-frolment of help patients getting an aliex It was quite nice just to be able to have that Again, extra stuff that you can't get access to Without a year or actually Or for us Okay, so again, going back to practical advice Number one, get feedback from universities Yeah, get your school to get it So it sounds more legit Number two, so your personal statement out Do more more and more experience More and more volunteering If that's what you were missing And I think I don't know if it leads to Do there have any points for extra triggers Anything like that Yeah, there was points for just You know, being involved in your sports team Yeah, that sort of thing They're not looking for a high level You don't have to be a You know, and then pick athlete I just played football for two teams I'm gonna catch into both of them Which probably helped in some ways But that was what I produced football I think as long as you've got something that you do That, you know They do like you to have a life outside of medicine They really like you to have a life outside of medicine And actually on that note When I was applying to medicine Our head of admissions to universities That school I told us an interesting story He went to a private school Because for some random social function or something And it was one of their Getting into medicine talks And they had like 50, 60 people applying to medicine And all actively getting in And what their head of admissions Said to everyone is like Right, hands up If you're not on a sports team for the school And a few people put their hands up And he was like Right, Johnny, you're now on the dive team Tom, you're not a basketball It's just like You know, it's It kind of goes to show Much of a game This whole medicine application thing is Yeah, it can be very much a game So I think like there is a tick box for Executively Yeah, exactly So, you know, if you don't have a sports A sports thing on your personal statement You have a year to become interested in a sport Join the local Bamminton club, join the local squash club They're very happy to accept beginners Yeah, yeah You know, there's somewhere you can do to kind of Get all these points in your personal statement Because the personal statement is Probably the thing that you can improve More than grades really Yeah, definitely I mean, because you can reset But I think by the time you've reset It's already too late to you Then kind of looking at Just applying with predictors again Well, it's like I'm not, because I didn't reset anything I was able to get an unconditional offer On out of these notes Sports as well You've got to remember that There's probably Most of your friends Or, you know, depending on what school You're out and stuff But they'll probably go off and do things Right, quite a few of them I go to uni Which can mean It's quite lonely This year off In some ways Joining the sports thing Can be fantastic I should have got golf That was my thing Because I had a few mates around You've got few Everybody's going to be somewhere to stay around There were three of us And we decided that we couldn't There was no sport, we could play for three Very well So we took off Because you can play as a three It was purely logistical Rather than it I love golf now But I'm not very good But Yeah, I'd say, you know, going Joining your local balance in club Can just give you some people to It's going to see on a Friday night When a lot of your friends are going to be around There at a time Yeah Could you tell us a bit about Kind of what What advice you'd give to people of retaking exams or anything like that I know that you didn't reset But you must have had Yeah, the two guys I was with Both reset exams It's easier Because you're looking back on it But you're late and you've gone all the time Especially when you pick one or two If you wouldn't reset the whole year You're looking at It just as hard as the first year But if you just pick the modules That you really need to bump up You can actually Do really well Because you've got so much time To give to it And the only other commitments you have Are a job or whatever But you can start off part time If you need to You know I was lucky that my parents Didn't make a pay rent And things so I could live Rent free and stuff So it depends on your situations But I just went part time for the initial bit And then increased my work To full time as I got kind of more bored To rest Okay And again When we were talking earlier You mentioned that having this This kind of money that you made On your cap here really To throughout university Could you definitely I mean It ended up working like a full time Because it was quite fun One thing Work becomes a bit of something to do And rather just sitting around at home On your own So I probably Well over 10,000 pounds in the year Working pretty much full time With more than a minimum wage Because the GP works pretty well paid Actually And yeah A lot of that I spent some of it going away That was really nice I went away for a couple of months Just before coming to university With no stresses No pressures I had my place I had my applications all done So that was really nice And I was all 18 Except for me So it's really good time to go Here at that point But then I actually kept quite a lot of it And it's floated me Definitely through university Each year I just had this back up Of quite a chunk of money That's Just about run out I'd say But there I got me through I don't know what I'd done without it But you know It was always another way But it was really helpful It was really helpful to give me Like a slightly more comfortable And I didn't have to work While I was here So if you're If you were to kind of high-platform The size Kind of Had you got on in First time round Versus Taking that gap here And getting in second time round Do you think that Overall Your glad that you took the gap here Or would you Do you still kind of wish that you'd been at Pay your head Yeah I'm really glad Actually I think it worked Really well for me I got into university I didn't apply to Cambridge first time round Thinking Definitely wouldn't get in Or whatever I know to don't know The second time round And so that was an improvement for me So in that sense You know It might not be perhaps Cambridge that you're looking at It might be some other universities But you might be able to get one That you didn't think you were able to The first time round Because actually your personal statement Is loads better You've got that grade That you missed out on The et cetera Just that makes sense So you're kind of able to go You know what Actually I can push for that side I won't Maybe just one of your applications You know, leave the other three Pretty much similar So that worked out The actual life experiences Were really good I think it's been very useful to have had a job You know, you get perhaps You know, as a doctor You're going to be treating the general public And it's quite nice to have been in there And seeing what a 9 to 5 looks like And be with time to stand it You know, because we do very different Oh my, it feels very different And additionally, you know, Going away was great And meeting all these guys Was pretty good as well Yeah, because if you got in the first time We wasn't never met Yeah, never met So yeah, it certainly wasn't You know, it felt devastating When it happened That I didn't get in Actually a year's nothing It really doesn't make a big difference And you know, I don't think these guys Think I'm ancient Just yet Although it was funny when And F2 that they told me She was the same age as me That's right She didn't into clay And that would be your off Oh yeah Okay, so finally things I wanted to talk to you about Firstly, put you tell us about your fifth choice And your tactic with that Yeah, so I mean in my first application I didn't bother with the fifth choice Because I thought I want to do medicine I don't get it I won't I'll reapply So I already had that in mind And even though when it happened I wasn't really didn't feel that prepared For it, I'd already kind of in my head It's all myself, I'm not going to bother Yeah It's a my decision was kind of clear I'm going to reapply there But second time around I went with Newcastle to do I think it's biomedicine Could be biochemist You can't remember exactly But I think biomedicine And the whole reason behind that was that they offer a transfer Straight from the biomedical course Two minutes And these are highly competitive Once you're in the course But I kind of thought I'm not going to have another year off I'm going to accept it I'm going to go down that route And try and get into medicine that way If I don't get in another way Okay, so in terms of In terms of in terms of the fifth choice Then Presumably there's like a list of universities That offer it as a segue And you can do that I think there's four or five Newcastle leads Few others are coming Yeah There's probably changes We'll put a link in the description To the Medic portal Who are famous competitive six minutes We'll still make them anyway Because it's a good thing It's a good article that they've done There are a few other ways You don't have to go through They're kind of Straight into undergrad And through a couple of ways Awesome So fifth choice Probably Be technical Think about fifth choice Be tactical about it I mean it really helped in one of my interviews Yeah Okay It was second year round With my Norwegian TV One of the stations Was what would you do if you didn't get in And one of the gate was What would you do if you didn't get in And I said Well, to be honest with you This is my second year of applying So if I didn't get in this time around I've got a fifth choice And by this time I actually would I knew that I had my place At Newcastle to do BioCow by me Whatever I said, I would accept that I would try and transfer across to Menson And then if that didn't work I'd finish the degree And I'd apply as a post-graph And it's a nice thing she quite liked that Oh, it's so because it just showed you I thought every avenue to get in It wasn't going to be any deterring me I was going to get there If anything actually Okay I think that's just as good Yeah, I'm going to get a bit blind I'm going to get a bit blind Okay, that's good That's a good My diffusing How did your interviews go Second time round It's a bit of the first time round It's generally based on the experience that you had Yeah, I just think I remember being asked a couple of questions And the first answer Successful year And there were simple questions The ones that we were supposed to prepare for Yeah, why don't you mention What sort of experiences have you got Yeah, and I just struggled to answer That in that times Okay, I found that I didn't have Enough experiences to pull on Yeah, so they asked me You know, I can't remember the specific questions If I remember thinking I'm using the same example here When you had one or two examples So I could only pull on And I was just kind of twisting And forcing them into the same The different questions that they asked him But like, why don't you mention Oh, well, you know, I went to the GP And I really enjoyed it there Okay, so what sort of experiences you've done To prove that you want to do I went to the GP Yeah, so it kind of tricks you out a little bit there And in the second time around You know, I felt every question I hadn't, you know, you prepare As we all do For interviews But some of the questions you don't expect You're not quite sure about But I had enough experiences From that year off You know, that actually I never felt stuck at any point I always had something different to say Something new to add You know, sometimes it led to a few jokes And stuff as well Sure, it was good I remember at the Cambridge interview They asked me Did I prefer working in the bar On the other job I did While working in the GP I did a bit of pharmacy work Which one did you prefer? The bar or the pharmacy And I couldn't help myself But to say Well, that's like choosing between drugs and alcohol Isn't it? Which did get a bit of a chuckle Oh, they must have loved that Yeah, so it sounds like Your application It was significantly stronger Second time around And I think that's probably a fair statement To make generally It once you've taken a gap here Provided you've done something useful With that gap here Your application is Very likely going to be better Than most other non-gapier applicants Yeah, I think you just got that time Yeah, to make it better And if you haven't made it better Than you've probably wasted your gap here in that sense Yeah Okay, um Had you not got it in second time And let's say you didn't have your Biomed offer from your castle What would you have done? Would you have been applied to medicine? Ah Tough question, I suppose And Because it certainly would have been Something that I had to think quite hard on Um I was absolutely fixed on doing medicine So I probably would have Reapplied But I would have probably applied to something like Biological sciences Thinking I might be able to get in that way Do gradmits I think rather than, you know I think Definitive insanity is trying the same thing They're really expecting different results If I'm not willing the second time around I wouldn't expect to get in the third Because I spent so long Make my application better the first time around Yeah That I mean I would have done all the same steps Just I think if I had to read that Why didn't I get him just to write When he had been something like Your interview technical is terrible You know, just doing interviews Actually on that point getting jobs is real useful For that Because I had to do about five interviews to get a job Oh okay Yeah They're different times of interviews But they weren't as scary when I went in Because I'd done five or six By this point Cool So thank you very much for talking to us I know It sounds like If I can summarize what we talked about One, you mentioned that Getting rejected was quite a blow But you've got to read it But we can decide is that you're going to make a national plan Yeah You're actually kind of involved You're actually kind of involved getting feedback I was going to get feedback from the university And that really helped you kind of mould your personal statement Into the world What they wanted to do in addition They gave the actual school gave me a bit of feedback And what they thought Yeah So And then in that gap here You worked at a GP Got experienced that way You did some more work experience Probably some more volunteering Yeah That stuff worked and worked and worked Got a job generally Made a bit money Took up golf as a side hobby Continue with your football So Made quite a lot of use of your gap here And once you got your Cambridge offer Which was unconditional Because you had your grades Then you just went on Traveling and had a great time Pretty much Sometimes So Yeah So like all of this stuff It seems to be focused around Having a plan of action And making sure you make The absolute most of the gap here As you can Most people that I've spoken to If everyone I've spoken to I've been here I've been happy that they took a gap here And I mentioned this in the other video Which you should link Watch up there and down here And everywhere else If you make the most of your gap here If you learn some new skills If you get more experience It'll just help you in life But also for your medicine application Yeah And just on that point If there's another video called 15 ways of tips on how to prepare for your interviews And one thing everyone says That you should make a list of talking points That if I get asked about communications skills If I get asked about empathy Teamwork Why I want to do medicine You kind of have this bank of experiences That you draw on from And you mentioned first time around All you had was GP And you kind of tried to shoot But it makes it everything Which is pretty obvious When they've asked you four questions And you've got the same example for each one So I think this kind of goes to share that It's even more important To have this bank of experiences That you can just draw on Don't you think they don't Actively ask you about them You know It's obviously better to have a variety Cool So any kind of parting advice For people who might be in your position Whether they're not going in Just a You know Keep positive It turns out to be one of the best Best years of your life So don't get too worked up by If I get too stressed out that you didn't get in Ultimately It's probably for the best you know I know these guys didn't perhaps But I wouldn't have met them All that other stuff So Yeah Just keep your head out Work hard You'll get it eventually Really? Thank you very much, Anton And guys If you have any questions for Anton Just leave a comment down below And I'll get him to I think he could've excelled I'd refer to him Like just if you don't want to Don't make a fight I'd refer to his comments Yeah Thank you very much I was really, really useful If you guys like the video Please give it a thumbs up If you haven't subscribed to the channel Please consider doing so More videos about medicine Application as always More vlogs And stuff Coming about life as a medical student If you're into that sort of thing Yep Thanks for watching We'll see you next time Bye Sick Thank you so much That's like so It's so easy It's fun
