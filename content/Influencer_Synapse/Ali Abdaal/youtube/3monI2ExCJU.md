## Transcript
 Hey friends, welcome back to the channel. This is going to be a bit of a rambling life update sort of video. Lots of stuff going on. I want to talk about what's been happening in my life and in the business, so there'll be like four or five things. What's happening moving forward to that be like five or six things and then a bunch of different challenges that I'm going through personally and like we're going through it. It's a business and that'll be like 15 things. So this is going to be a really, really, really long video that probably realistically won't be that valuable, objectively speaking. So if you want something that will add value to your life more explicitly, then please probably click off this and watch a video cry. I don't know Matt DiBello or Peter McKinnon or Thomas Frankenstead, but if you're interested in finding more about my life and the business and how things are going and how things feel as if they're falling apart, then feel free to continue watching. I guess the main thing is that I have now moved to London. I spent nine years in Cambridge and then moved to London about two months ago and here I am now. This is where I'm going to be living for the next year. That's been pretty big, pretty big move. It's been interesting being in London because now my social calendar was a lot more full than it was in Cambridge and a lot of my friends are here in London and the pace of life here seems pretty, pretty strong as well, just that everything is quite a lot more expensive than it was back in Cambridge and very excitingly we also have this studio now. So if you look around me, you can see it's all kind of a bit of a mess. We got this big space, we've got a lease for a year and when we first moved in it was like two weeks ago, it was a Friday and I was here on my own, the place was pretty empty, just had the desks in it and I had really had this strong sense of buyers remorse thinking like, what the hell, what the hell have I done, how I spent so much money on this office space. This is costing us, you know, given that I'm all about transparency and keeping it real and stuff, it's costing us about 11,000 pounds a month plus VAT. So VAT is 20% towards that, like 13k a month, which over the course of a year is about 150,000 pounds for this studio space here in London. That is utterly absurd when I think about it, but I'm sort of tentatively hoping fingers crossed that it will be ROI positive, return on investment positive and we'll get more than 150,000 pounds of value by virtue of having a studio space, then if we didn't have a studio space and if I kept shooting at home. And to be honest, like the rationale for getting this was that while I was in Cambridge for the last few months, me and Angus on my team members stationed ourselves in the local we work and it was super nice having a place to commute to like I'd cycle to the we work or drive there and I'd be there all day, have lunch there and I'd have dinner afterwards and then go back home and it was so nice not having to do work while I was at home and my desk set up, my fancy house desk set up, you know, which I've talked about on this channel quite a lot and I'm just not really being used because I realized that actually I do everything on my laptop or on my phone or on my iPad and I don't really need this fancy house screen and all that kind of stuff, but it was actually so good having an office to commute to and I now I realize that oh my god, you know this whole like nine to five thing maybe there is something to it rather than the whole hey I'm working from home I can do whatever I want anyway so when I moved to London I knew that I wanted to get some kind of studio and we found this kind of office space which is so nice you know there's windows and either sides a lot of natural light coming in and it's just such a nice sort of inspiring vibe to hang out in so now I've kind of made a rule for myself for that no cameras at home, no filming at home probably gonna break that rule at some point but this is the studio it just makes coming to work and doing this YouTube thing doing the business thing a lot more fun and we now have people here in the studio in persons and this was here earlier today we've got Lucas helping filming today and the idea is that on Mondays everyone to get everyone the team gets together and we have like a content brainstorm session without writers and our YouTube producer and me and Angus and the rest of the team and we had we've had that recently kind of over the past few days and that's been super nice so that's really the rationale behind getting the studio but there was still this large amount of like buyers remorse inside of me thinking oh my god this place is stupid expensive speaking of stupidly expensive we've also had a bit of a kind of hiring spree recently so you might have seen a few months ago I posted a video talking about how we're hiring people for the team and the time we were hiring for like eight positions and loads of people applied and we're still in the process of recruiting some of the final positions but last time I counted which was a few minutes ago we now have around like 18, 19 people on the team excluding me of which like four are kind of part-time like three days a week four days a week three two or three days a week and the rest are full-time you know I was at this YouTuber convention last week and people were like oh you know how's the team I was like yeah we've got we've got 19 people now you know 19 people what the hell do you need 19 people for and I was like yeah you're right that's a really good point what the hell do we need 19 people for but it's been one of those things where it's like you know as as the business of expanded especially with the courses especially with the part-time YouTuber Academy there's just all these as we draw our draw out our organizational chart which is the thing I'll do later in the video as we draw out the old chart we see that there's all these different holes of expertise within the team and we've got people like angus doing like seven people's jobs we've got people like gack of doing four people's jobs and a lot of the team was quite overstretched and it just didn't realize this before where you know when when you're growing and growing and it's like oh I guess we'll just launch this course I guess we'll just do that and that and that and more and more stuff gets added to people's where then kind of we took a step back and we realized oh crap we actually do need a lot a lot of people to do this sort of stuff so now we have like four slash five people full time just on our part-time YouTuber Academy which is good we have sort of four slash five writers now we're going to be helping with brainstorming content ideas and doing research helping with the YouTube channel other YouTube channels that we're starting more more on that later helping with my book more on that later helping with the blog and with articles and then newsletter and social media and all this all this kind of stuff and we're still in the process of hiring a videographer and we're probably going to be looking for another editor fairly soon so yeah the team is expanding and it all feels kind of scary like this is one of the things that keeps me up at night thinking that oh my god if we're literally spending like a million pounds a year on salaries for the team and that's fine for now because we can't afford to do that as a business but it's like the more people we hire the more the fixed costs of running this business go up and the more it becomes reliant and oh crap you know now that we have all these people's salaries and mortgage to pay you know the YouTube channel better be doing well you know our courses better be doing well it really kind of ramps up the pressure whereas when the team is small or when it was just me it was like oh I don't know what I want this is just a side hustle but now it's somehow turned into this actual actual real-life business where people's livelihoods are kind of depending on which is kind of scary um so I'm kind of like you know not trying to think too hard about it but at the same time it does keep me up at night thinking shit how we're going to afford all this stuff especially if you know in this business you have your sort of 15 minutes of fame and then things start to decline and the thing I'm always worried about especially for video does badly is you know are we now on the road to decline and therefore are we're going to have to let go of people are we're going to have to cut down our costs so we're going to have to I don't know do fewer things that I want to do just because we can't afford to do this kind of stuff anymore so yeah just really ramps up the pressure but hey it's kind of a nice problem to have it is it is exciting while also being scary at the same time and I guess final update before we talk about kind of what's next is that we've launched the deep dive podcast this has been a thing that wanted to do for a while it took a while working sort of working progress we kind of doubled with it about a year ago with kind of the deep dive live stream interview series I don't know I'm using this microphone it's not even active um but this is sort of like the podcast set up for now we have a very kind of minimum viable studio set up so like normally there's like a tree behind me there's a tree behind the guest over there there's like stuff but what we're trying to do with the studio is tone it into like a sort of super sick place we're going to book shelves, lamps, trees, plants, the horse bank but the podcast seems to be going well people seem to be liking the interviews I'll put a link to the deep dive podcast link in the video description if you want to check it out so that's been good and we've got Amber who's one of our team members now who's kind of producing the podcast and so reaching out to guests and like compiling research thingies about them and telling me right Ali you've got to read this person's book by next week and then I have the book on Audible or on Kindle and then I listen to the book at like whatever expedite so that I'm prepared for the interview that I do with the person and that's been that's been fun like it's really cool having an excuse to have a long form chat with someone who I wouldn't normally speak to um so podcast definitely a long-term project that I'm I'm pretty excited about it's nice because doing a podcast kind of takes the pressure off a little bit because my job is to ask questions and I love asking questions and like finding out more about the person and being interested in their life story so it feels like a sustainable way of doing the content thing and I really admire what people like um Tim Ferriss and Lex Friedman and Lewis Hoes School of Greatness have done with this format the podcast format where initially like for example with Tim Ferriss his content started off as being all about him like the four-hour work week for our chef for our body he's the guy who is like doing all the experiments and like doing everything himself but then circa 2014 2015 sort of his focus shifted to the podcast where it's now shining the spotlight on other people and that I think is really cool because it adds a lot longevity I think to his brand so that he doesn't have to continuously be the front-runner the showrunner himself he can just interview other people just interview he can interview other people which adds value to the audience in a really nice way so we're hoping to do more of that kind of stuff so those were a few updates I want to talk about a few things about what's kind of happening next in the business one of the main things is that we're trying to make this studio look good it's kind of an office space but I like to refer to it as the studio because it sounds more cool and if I tell myself another people oh yeah I'm just going to head down to the studio and sounds like I'm a cool guy whereas I'm just going down to the office sounds like I'm a corporate slave which is the thing I've been trying to avoid all my life but yeah decent natural light coming in I'll give you a little bit of a tour of what it's like at the moment we have a nice little kind of outdoor balcony area which is pretty sick where we could actually potentially film some stuff and fact the audio outside here is much better there's no echo unlike the audio in over there but the idea is that we want to just make this place look absolutely sick filming videos so the idea is that this back wall over here will probably have sofa over here probably be like a bookshelf lamp plant plant plant loads of plants loads of greenery and I really want to go for a sort of light airy pastel colored vibe if you remember if you watched the channel for a few months in my place in Cambridge I had those three posters of like London South Africa and Tokyo with a sort of like light pastel colors and I really like that kind of vibe but I also want loads of like greenery here so maybe you know those pickup lines pick up lines make up lines make anything youtube channel so the air in her studio has like those plants that like really plants that go down that looks really cool I'd love to do something like that with the space and so the idea would be that we'd be able to film videos in here and also you know so that there's a kind of camera angle in this direction there is potentially a camera angle in this direction potentially get rid of the guitar camera angle in this direction maybe with the windows in the background that kind of stuff and also when we do the podcast we're going to get a table so it can be like you know I can sit over here or the guests can sit over here and then we can move across and then the other person sits over there so we have three angles for the podcast and it would be sick if we can just have everything set up with maybe ceiling mounted lights and microphones and all that jazz kind of like what Peter McKinnon and MKBHD do and these people like the Linus tech tips these people with actual youtube studios and to reduce the friction of filming as much as possible so that's kind of like what's going on next number one we're potentially trying to work with an interior designer figure out what to do with the space secondly we have just launched our fourth cohort of the part-time youtuber academy and that's been good um I don't have any sales run right now but I think we sold 300 spaces within like the first day or two something like that that's pretty sick so just a few places left sign up if you want to that's fun that's launching on the first of November officially that's when it's starting and that'll be interesting I'm gonna be actually in Pakistan for about three weeks so we've been trying to do a lot to figure out how do we get there internet to be sorted and really make the setup as pro is it can possibly be so pretty excited to do our part-time youtuber academy four which will kind of mark the one here anniversary and it was actually almost exactly a year ago I think it was October the 19th 2020 where angus and i sat down and we're like alright let's plan out this youtube course and we got a bunch of like sticky notes and starting drafting things out and that then turned into this product of the part-time youtuber academy which is now crossed over two million dollars in revenue in the last 12 months which is pretty mental because of that it meant that we could afford like the studio space and afford to expand the team and hire people just for the youtuber academy but it's also very scary because now a huge chunk of the revenue of the business is dependent on the part-time youtuber academy doing well and that's like a really really scary place to be because if it doesn't do well you know it's done really well so far but you can't in this industry is very hard to sort of predict a growth and it may just be that it starts to plateau it starts to decline and that feels scary because it's like now we're so reliant on it as a stream of income that we need to diversify into other things so some of the stuff we're working on is some of your courses are basically just trying our best to make the free content on the youtube channel and podcast and stuff really really good and then made the paid content like the courses really really good and the ideas that the courses fund the free content and I often think that if I had unlimited money if I didn't need to worry about money at all in the business we wouldn't bother making courses we would just do everything for free but while we do still have to worry about money a little bit I think it's nice because the courses appeal to people who kind of afford to them and we give scholarships to people who can't and that funds all of the rest of the free content so that's kind of what's happening with our youtuber academy I guess kind of what's going on next number three is that book writing is now underway and this is a big part of like like my calendar these days is so chocolate block with random crap when I say crap is sort of like meetings and stuff and especially doing the podcast now like it's really fun spending two three hours interviewing someone but then that's like sort of four hours out of my day and now that I'm in the process of writing writing my book you can sign up to the mailing list in the video description it's like you know all of these little things eats into writing time and so I've started telling myself you know I'm gonna wake up at 7 o'clock every single day and have three hours in the morning to write and actually woke up at 7 o'clock this morning and spent about half an hour writing but then I had this eye appointment and you know this random stuff seems to always get in the way despite me thinking oh how can it be to just have three four hours of writing time in the day I think it's been it's been interesting because as the team's expanded and as I've spent more and more of my time doing the business side I've been able to spend less time doing the content side so what we're trying to do moving forward is trying to get like angus and the rest of the team to handle the business side of running the business so that I can focus on what I think I do best which is kind of hopefully coming up a decent content and hopefully writing this book I guess crossed which should come out in about two years if everything goes according to plan so that's another major update and I guess finally one of the things we're really trying to do for the over the next few months is getting our house in order I want to mean by that is like famously back in the day I don't know what year it was there was one year just before Amazon Amazon hit like one billion in revenue or something like that and Jeff Bezos said to his team okay this next 12 months we need to spend getting our house in order the objective is not to grow the objective is not to like doing anything fancy and launch any products and stuff the objective is to get our house in order and make sure all of our processes are good all of our systems are good everyone knows what they're doing we've got clarity we've got good organizational structure and they spent a whole year doing that but and now that we've sort of expanded so fast to a team of sort of around about just under 20 people I think we definitely need a few months to get our house in order one of the challenges which we'll talk about is like you know it would be nice if we didn't have to make youtube videos during this time but one of the challenges with being a youtuber and sort of in a way being a slave to the algorithm is that this feeling of being on a hamster wheel of continuing to channel content and feeling like oh if I take a break from posting on youtube then algorithm will be well think I'm bad or whatever and people will stop watching and if people stop watching that has a knock on effect on the rest of the business because now we're a team of 20 people it's like we need the videos to do well we need a youtube channel to be successful to sustain this team of 20 people so it's like a weird kind of the more you grow the more you have to grow to keep up with the demands of growth this weird kind of kind of thing that I wouldn't have considered back in the day in the early days of starting the youtube channel when it was just me for two years doing all the filming all the editing all that kind of stuff yeah we're gonna spend the next few months getting our house in order let's now talk about I think I made a list of 15 different challenges that meet and the business are going through and I'll just kind of speel about some of those as we as we move around space so I guess challenge number one is a kind of medium to long-term planning you know I think back in the day was very easy to be like oh this youtube thing is a side hustle and I'm just gonna make video after video in my goal for the for the channel was just to make one or two videos a week and I didn't really think of it beyond that but now that we have a team and now we're growing stuff we need to start thinking in terms of like medium-term planning long-term planning and that's something that's a bit of a challenge because it's like what even is kind of planning in this sort of industry things change so much but at the same time we do need to have a destination to be vaguely pointing towards so people know what they're doing people have kind of clarity on what the what their job involves what it might look like in a few years time and I think I'm the sort of person where in a way I kind of feel I'm kind of happy happy making stuff up as we go along and launching a product because I feel like it and doing a video because I feel like it but I'm starting to think more about putting some sort of vague semblance of like planning and structure in place mostly so that like the team know what we're working towards because otherwise it's apparently you know if you have a job it's kind of hard to do it well if you don't know what the job is kind of aiming towards and what you're doing there so the question is like you know what is the point of this business what's the point of this YouTube channel what's the point of the content what might this look like three years from now five years from now one year from now who knows the way I'm kind of thinking about it is you know the content I care about making is content that it sounds really cliche but that that helps people live their best life by creating kind of inspiring and educational content and that's the stuff I'm interested in and I'm interested in what makes it fulfilled and happy and meaningful life and what I'm hoping is that as I explore more of that kind of stuff that we can then make videos that talks about that sort of stuff and maybe shares it with you and shares it with you guys not in a sense of like I figured out the answer to the meaning of life and I'm telling you more in the sense of hey this is a question I'm trying to figure out and here are the things that have helped me along the way so I think that's the direction that we're on the content to go in hopefully the podcast will help with that side of things because we can then interview experts who are experts on relationships and happiness and longevity and health and fitness and stuff so that it's not again it's not just about me trying to pretend to be an expert on all the things but actually we're showcasing the expertise of other people as well and then I guess sort of challenge number two almost is really a dream you know this question that we're all trying to answer which is the question of what do I actually want from my life and it's something that I don't really think about very often when you're on a ladder it's like it's like you know when I was working as a doctor it's like it's a very clear kind of ladder of progression and you don't often stop to think what do I actually want to do with my life you just sort of go for the next thing since taking a break from medicine and starting focusing on this business thing the equivalent ladder I found myself on is oh I guess we'll just aim for more views and more subscribers and more revenue and more courses and just more and more more and I just haven't really stopped to think like what do I actually want to do you know now that I've got the freedom broadly to design my life the way I want within reason it's a nice problem to have but it also is a bit of a challenge because when you have so many options it's hard to know which one to go for and it's hard to even know what all the options are like I think back when I was working in medicine and it was like a very confined, creative career part you like okay I need to pick what specialty I want but I've still got a choice of 20 specialties to pick from whereas now it's like I don't really know if I still want to be a doctor forever or I don't know if I wanted to do the YouTube thing forever like what the hell do I want to do I don't know it's like there's a whole world of options it's not like a kind of you can choose from these 20 different find options but if anyone has any tips on that do let me know the comments like anything you found helpful in terms of thinking about medium to long term direction of your own life one thing I found helpful is you know this this Odyssey plan exercise that I've talked about a few times asking this question of what does my life look like five years from now down this current path and then putting that aside what does my life look like five years from now if I took a completely different path and putting that aside and then asking ourselves what does my life look like five years from now if money and status and what other people think what no object and so I'd last did that exercise I think probably a year ago and I need to repeat that because that did help me at the time get parity and what I actually want from my life um that's a bit of a challenge trying to figure this out while also popping out the content and running a business and and all that stuff and kind of related to that um one thing I've been trying to ask myself is like what is the infinite game that I want to play this is a book finite infinite games where the guys basically lead with you know there are some games in life that are finite games that have an ending and there are other games in life that are infinite games and I think a finite game is something like I want to get into med school it's like you know that's a finite game or I want to graduate med school or I want to get a first in my exams or I don't know I want to stop this business in a way these real finite games they have like an end an end goal whereas I want to try and figure out like what is what is the game what is the infinite game I want to play what is the thing that I would I would want to do that I would be happy to do kind of forever like what does that look like if I won the lottery if I had I don't know 10 million in the bank or whatever and I didn't theoretically if I didn't care about money at all what is the thing that I would spend my time doing and when I think of that I often do land on I probably would still continue to make YouTube videos because the thing I care about is like reading writing like learning new things and teaching teaching is ultimately I think one of my main passions in life and so if I can teach at scale by making videos about stuff and maybe do some teaching in real life maybe medical school teaching maybe not maybe like teaching entrepreneurship or teaching how to be a creator that feels like it would be pretty fun and I would do that even if I was not getting paid for it if I didn't need money I probably wouldn't continue to make courses because I think courses is teaching but I don't I kind of don't like the fact that we charge for them because you know we have to sustain the business but if we don't have to I wouldn't I wouldn't charge people for education so there's one thing about in terms of the infinite game and what's the trying to think about like you know there's an exercise that one of my one of my friends turned me on to the ideal ordinary week exercise like what does your ideal ordinary week look like um ordinary week in that like you know you're not holiday but ideal isn't like you know if you could design your life however you wanted what would it be trying to think I you know thinking about this like okay well I'd want to play sports probably twice a week I want to go to the gym probably twice a week I'd want to kind of have a board games night in my place where I cook maybe once a week I'd want to play more Maventon and Squash and like table tennis and tennis and I'd want to maybe go on holiday once a month with friends and I'd want to have lots of time each day for deep work whether it's reading a book or doing some writing and I think well I don't just do that like what is actually stopping me from making that my schedule and the answer is always like oh I don't know I don't know why this isn't my schedule like I actually can do what I want but I think you know a useful thing to do to ask ourselves like what does my ideal ordinary week look like and why is it that my current week my current calendar does not reflect that so just a little bit of a sort of challenge they're thinking about in terms of what is the infinite game I want to play and what does what is what is the sort of calendar that I would be happy to have forever and obviously my preferences are going to change over time but I think it is worth thinking about that question I want to make sure I'm actually enjoying the journey rather than just being fixated on on a destination another challenge which is so we're sort of kind of good bouncing about all over the place is thinking about organizational design like what what does our organization structure look like what are the different roles of the different team members you know now that we've got for getting 20 people on the team what are they all doing um what are there like job descriptions accountability is what are the you know should we have metrics what are the goals of the working towards what does exceptional performance in their role look like I'm not much of a numbers guy I don't really like metrics and goals and stuff but apparently when you run a business people depending on who they are do like having some level of clarity about what the job is and what they're working towards so basically trying to figure out like organizational design so what does it look like one way of thinking of it is sort of there's a visionary and an integrator and sort of visionaries me and integrators angus and then sort of within the business we've got like sales and marketing we've got operations we've got sort of production it's all somewhat semantic because like what do you what do you call these things and then there's sort of legal slash HR slash finance and we've got these as like different boxes within the team then within sales and marketing we've got sort of our website we've got social media and we've got sort of general marketing for our courses and all that kind of stuff within operations we have like for example the YouTube channel which has a producer we have the podcast which has a producer we've got a part-time YouTuber Academy which has its own sort of strategy person it's got an ops manager and it's got like two ops associates within production we've got like pre-production which is sort of our five writers we've got production which is our videographer that we have not yet hired we have post-production which is like our kind of two editors times two and a sort of freelance artist times one the the struggle is in thinking is this the best way to structure the organization and the whole thing about structuring an organization does matter because you know let's say you're one of the operations associates let's say you're Tommy or Alyssa and you've just been hired into the team you kind of want to know who your director manager is if you're reporting to what the overall goals for the team are and given that an individual person can manage around about six people max people say we need like given that we have twenty people we need to have some level of middle management and that sounds like a very like cool pretty type thing like you know if you can middle management but it actually is important because you know if we've decided that I'm the content guy the chief content officer as it were and I want to spend the bulk of my time writing and doing video stuff that means I can't be spending a large amount of time managing people people say that it takes about a quarter of a day every week if for each person that you manage so if you're managing four people you're spending one day a week on managing four people if you're managing eight people you're spending two days a week managing eight people if you're a really good manager you know within management you want to have weekly one on one meetings with everyone of your team members holding them to account making sure they're working on the things that they're working on and giving them support helping them grow and develop as people and as like employees and all that chance it's a lot of work doing this management thing which is that which I really under like did not appreciate when I first started bringing people onto the team but the challenge with with this structure is like well is this really the structure that we need there are different ways of structuring a business this is a sort of waterfally kind of approach there is another sort of more agile way of structuring a business where you have teams and you have like you whip up a squad of maybe like three or four people and that forms a team for a particular project and then it depends on what sort of project management system you use whether you use the sprint method or these other ones and this is all stuff that's all very new to me I'm just sort of making the stuff up up stuff up as I go along as I read books um a few books that have been really helpful you know traction by Gino someone the great CEO within recently I read making of the manager the one minute manager had to be a great boss the seven four sessions of an extraordinary executive there's all these books that talk about the sort of stuff that I would have completely dismissed a few years ago like well the head is all this BS corporate member drumboe who cares about like how you structure an organization like it's all just semantics isn't it at the end of the day but it's actually not like it's really important when you go to a certain size to have clear kind of flows of accountability like you know who is ultimately accountable for I don't know our sales numbers for our youtuber academy or our student satisfaction metrics for our youtuber academy and ultimately I'm the one who's accountable for absolutely everything but the point of hiring people is you want to give you want to handle some of that accountability and the responsibility to them so that instead of just me being up at night wondering oh my god are the students on our youtuber academy happy is that are the videos doing well there are other people who have that as part of their jobs that hey your job is to you know for example Elizabeth is sort of chief strategy officer or whatever you want to call it for our youtuber academy and her job is to make sure the students have an amazing time and so it's really nice being able to offload their responsibility to her and trusting that that will be her job for how many days a week that that she's working for us equally now that we've hired a youtube producer basically is their job to keep track of all the content schedules and what contents have coming out in the main channel the second channel the third channel that we're going to launch the podcast channels man it was sort of just figuring out and keeping track of all those things it's actually quite a lot of work once you get to a certain scale and so it'll be nice to be able to offload that to them but this is all all feels kind of tricky because I don't really know what I'm doing and most people in the team also don't really know what they're doing when it comes to leadership and management because we don't have we've got broadly young people like I think probably the average age of our team members is about 26 27 which is my age in fact probably slightly younger than that possibly is the average age and you know as someone in there early to the mid 20s you just don't really have experience with management and leadership and stuff at least not to the degree where you're managing a team of 20 people effectively so it's been fun learning and the stuff and being at that sort of steep bit of the learning curve where like every new bit of learning leads to a significant increase in like expertise and I find that anytime I read one of these books I was messing with something like oh my god I guess I've just read the four obsessions of an extraordinary executive it's really really really good and then he reads the book as well and then we learn from it and then we kind of like grow together and this is kind of nice but it's still a bit of a challenge because it's like well what is all this stuff? I can't people just like I don't know you know this is your job we're just going to do it and but that's like not a thing that's not a fair way to treat team members they need to know who the report to and like what the structures look like and all that kind of jazz so that has been what our org designs struggle to look like moving back into the communal area which is kind of nice do I have my card with me so here I guess another thing that's I think about a lot in terms of in terms of content is just trying to make sure that our content is like good and trying to define what good actually means because we could define good in terms of like the metrics in terms of views in terms of likes in terms of comments but the danger with that is then you start chasing the metrics and I think being honest like for the past few weeks like we put out one or two videos or two or three videos that where if I you know if I'm being honest the objective of those videos was to chase the views rather than because I thought the video itself was actually valuable and was actually going to help people I feel bad that that was the direction my thinking was going and it's interesting like a very tassim did a great a great video on the unreasonable effectiveness of clickbait oh the audio here is quite nice yeah the unreasonable effectiveness of clickbait and how when you put so much effort into making a YouTube video you want to find a title that intrigues people enough that they click on it and they get value from it but not so intriguing that it borders into clickbait territory and I think you know now that's we've ramped up the pressure on this YouTube channel having to do well I made the mistake of going too much into clickbait territory in a couple of recent videos to the point that we even I actually deleted from the videos because when I thought to myself is this actually good content that I feel proud of that feels authentic the answer was no I was like alright cool let's just delete the video let's avoid doing that sort of content now and I guess this this sort of that coming back to is the content good you know one part of it is how does it do on the metrics but another big part of it is do I feel proud do I feel happy with this this video does it feel authentic do I feel it would add value to at least one person while thinking about the metrics slightly I'm trying to move more towards creating content that I find is authentic and could be valuable to at least one person and I was speaking to Becky and Chris and also Charlie from Chris Moncomand on a live stream last weekend and they both said something like something similar they both talked about how when they make a video they asked themselves is this a video I'm proud of and if it is then it goes live and yeah try and give it a decent title and the thumbnail but then don't think about it and if it's a video I'm not proud of then it's okay why I'm uploading this video what's the point in the past I was holding myself to her I have to put out two videos every week and one of them needs to be a sponsored video and therefore if I run out of ideas one day or if a video just wasn't ready on time I would end up putting together something that I wasn't proud of I end up going live and it was like oh well there's a sponsored deadline and therefore we have to put this video out but what I've realized now is that actually it doesn't matter if there's a sponsored deadline you know if brilliant a sponsoring a video they're not this one what I think but a brilliant a sponsoring a video you know I've been working with them for like two years now they're great I think this message to me like hey guys hey Calvin sorry video is going to be a bit delayed and they're like yeah cool you know creator mental health comes first before anything else obviously don't put out a video you're not proud of I don't need to put out a video just for the sake of the fact that it's sponsored um or the fact that I'm holding myself to this arbitrary twice a week upload schedule I'm kind of using this video the way of thinking it out loud I guess thinking it out loud the bar for a video going out on the main channel now is going to be do I think this is actually a good video that will add value to people in some way and can we pick up an appropriate title and thumbnail that reflects that in a fair way and trying not to go into clickbait territory while at the same time telling that line because you know it's a game you gotta play hit the player don't hit the game other way around hit the game don't hit the player so that'll be the plan and actually so you know we'll meant to publish a video four days ago didn't go out because I thought that's the way of making this video better so I think moving forward I'm we're not gonna hold ourselves to a rigid publishing schedule it still would be nice to be able to bang on two videos a week but if not it's not the end of the world who cares I think we're our focus is now on a quality brother than quantity of uploads whereas certainly if you're starting to use starting a youtube channel back in the day if you're in the early days of starting a youtube channel focusing on quantity actually does help because the more videos you make the better you get in making videos but I think in our case once you've gone to a certain point where I've been doing this for nearly five or four and a half years now four years and a bit you know the quality of the videos is that sort of knowing how to make videos no longer the concern I know how to use a camera we know how to edit we know how to do background music like it's all fairly standard stuff the thing now is like is this actually a good video so that's that's kind of another challenge that I've been thinking about a lot and the other thing as well is experimenting with different platforms that's been a bit of a challenge because especially with like the advent of TikTok and how you know some people are like oh TikTok is taking over oh this place is very echoey oh well people like TikTok is taking over the world um TikTok is just a billion users and we're thinking you know should we be on TikTok you know is is YouTube dying um that that kind of stuff and I don't know like we've been trying to repurpose some of the content for YouTube shorts and for Instagram if TikTok and things like that but the the thing that I'm used to doing is kind of very in-depth educational long form YouTube videos where I can just ramble and talk about something that I'm quite familiar with and that sort of content really doesn't lend itself to like TikTok and YouTube shorts and IGTV and stuff because those aren't really long form platforms and so the question kind of becomes should we bother experimenting with these what is like what does our strategy on TikTok look like what does our strategy on YouTube shorts look like and we've got a few ideas but it always feels like you know everyday there's some new kind of young person blowing up on TikTok or blowing up on Instagram or even YouTube through YouTube shorts back in the day when I was just starting out YouTuber as just starting out as a YouTuber I would look at these established YouTubers and think oh my god that's incredible that they've done this for so long I really aspire to be like them but now you know now we're at the point where like this channel has become the thing that other people aspire to and we're no longer that new kid on the block we are in fact the incumbent you know the one that other people are trying to disrupt in kind of the startup or business world and it doesn't quite work like that in content in that it's not a zero-sum game it's not the case that someone who watches Matt TVellers not also going to watch me because they watch Matt TVellers like this not really how it works usually the rising tide lifts all the boats at least that's how I see it and so I don't think of other YouTubers as being competitors but more like collaborative slash colleagues such whatever but even so it's still that challenge of you know should we be on TikTok should we be pushing harder on these other social platforms that don't really care that much about the end of the day because they don't really vibe with them as much as they vibe with long form YouTube content and I think it all comes back to if you're a sort of operator building a lifestyle kind of business you can you can kind of do what you want but when you go into sort of building a actual business mode and hiring a team now dealing with 20 people you start having to ask questions like huh should we be on TikTok even though don't really care about TikTok but is mean not caring about TikTok hurting the business and therefore hurting the longevity of what we can do just because I don't understand TikTok myself yeah that's not the challenge the other you know we're doing a lot of challenges the other challenge that that's happening right now is a challenge that I've been thinking about basically since I started the YouTube channel which is what is this balance between having a niche versus not having a niche like what is what is my niche of content you know is it productivity but like that's a bit you know I don't really care that much about productivity productivity just using your time well yes productivity hacks and stuff but there's only so much you can talk about productivity is it starting for exams you know back in the day when I was studying a lot for exams I cared a lot about how to study effectively for exams now that I don't really have exams anymore I care a lot less about studying for exams but if I was if I kind of niche myself down to the studying genre it's like as I grow what is the content become who knows you know these days this whole thing about living your best life I think kind of the four pillars of that are health wealth love and happiness and that's all stuff that I care about but that's very broad that covers all aspects of life should I be a wealth channel focusing on entrepreneurship of personal finance and productivity should we be a health channel focusing on nutrition and fitness or even just fitness should we be a tech channel focusing on just tech reviews should we be a I don't know talking about happiness channel just talk talks about like gratitude and journaling and mindfulness and stuff like I want to talk about all those things but it doesn't really have a clear niche I think it's probably a balance between the business and the art maybe there's another right way of looking at it like most YouTube growth coaches would say if you want to blow up on YouTube you need to niche down as much as possible you need to find your niche and target that niche you need to like control that niche but it's just more fun doing kind of a wide variety of content that's kind of focused around the stuff I care about rather than being confined to a particular niche but again this is a question of like you know I prefer to do a variety of content but ultimately inevitably it's the productivity stuff that does better and the finance stuff that does way better than anything else that I do if I talk about gratitude or happiness or impact or meaning or effective altruism or donating to charity you know those videos do really badly no one seems to care about those as much as they care about 10 productivity hacks or you know iPhone 10 review kind of vibes better the same time that's more the content that that that is also the content I want to create and so this is sort of balance between creating the stuff that I want to create versus creating the stuff that is objectively by the numbers better for the business and I don't know what that balance is I'm leaning towards you know what screw the screw what the number say like I would love to have an attitude of screw or the number say I'm just going to make the content that I think is useful and then I think is valuable and the numbers will take care of themselves I think Matt DiVella has a phrase which is that be so good that you can ignore the algorithm I think I have some really good way of doing it I don't think I'm anywhere near as good as Matt is at making the videos but I think probably leaning more towards you know like a video like this one there's probably pretty long at this point don't really know what the title is going to be not sure how well this video is going to do but I think this is an interesting video to make and a bunch of people have asked me a hate need a little bit more behind the scenes you stuff what are you thinking about what's going on and it doesn't have a clear value add it's not like a clear here are 10 productivity hacks to make you more productive it's a bit more of a rambles but I think I hope this will be an interesting video and so I'd put this out on the main channel even though it might not do well so I do kind of want to move more in that direction think like not worrying so much about the numbers and actually thinking more about what do I want to make and what do I think will be authentic and potentially valuable for at least one person and I guess two more things that I want to talk about number one is medicine I'm still not entirely decided about whether I want to pursue medicine in the long term I had a really great chat with Lewis Hose on his podcast School of Greatness a few weeks ago where we talked a lot about this and he really challenged my thinking on this because before my vibe was always hey I'll do medicine part time because it's fun maybe trained in emergency medicine and then I'll do the youtube thing on the side and he really challenged me on this he was like why do you want to do this I do really enjoy it are you really passionate about it and I was like I want to see not really like I'm passionate about teaching teaching is the thing that I care about and I really enjoy medicine if for example I'm working and I've got medical students with me because then I can teach as I'm doing the job but I didn't particularly enjoy the job as when it was just me kind of dealing with the patients his point which was very reasonable was like you know if if teaching is ultimately the thing you care about why are you sort of half-hassing medicine for one day a week or two days a week when you could be spending that time doing teaching instead it's like to happen that's a really good point the other thing I was concerned about was I had a had a real like fear fear on two fronts number one the fear of what if this entire business comes crashing down and things don't work out anymore etc etc if that happens then well at least I can just be a doctor as a backup option and again what Lewis challenged me on he was like okay how much money you're gonna make as a doctor I was like 40k a year he was like you could probably find a way of making 40k a year through the skills that you've now got through doing the YouTube stuff and the business stuff and I guess before that I hadn't really quite appreciated that I have like developed skills while doing this skills in I don't know all the stuff around videos and all the stuff around going and running a business and things and if I needed to if I lost absolutely everything I got cancelled for work for whatever reason and if the YouTube channel disappeared overnight I probably still find a way of making money to support myself and my family without being a doctor and probably make more money without being a doctor so then the question becomes okay well if you can make money if you can make more money doing something else do you enjoy doing the medicine thing is it meaningful and impactful or fulfilling enough to warrant doing and honestly my current feeling on that it's probably not like I said the thing that I personally find fulfilling is teaching rather than practicing medicine which is not the case for all my colleagues a lot of my colleagues freaking love love being doctors and that's great but that wasn't really the case for me so I don't know still if it feels like you know the partly it's a some cost six years of med school two years of practicing as a foundation your doctor that's eight years of my life they'll devote to medicine and I don't regret any of it and if I had my time I would do the same thing but it just feels like should I be pursuing medicine even though I don't really want to but I think that's that's interesting because when we find ourselves you know someone said to me once that you know lots of should sleep to a shitty life well and if I think I should do medicine rather than I want to do medicine then that's probably not a great way of I'm living life that's one challenge still still kind of thinking about that but leaning towards just leaving medicine completely the other reason that scariest that this whole fear of you know I built my brand off the back of being a doctor like hey I'm a doctor from the original blah blah blah and I do this productivity stuff on the side and that made the YouTube channel kind of interesting whereas now it's like well what do I do in life I make YouTube videos for living I like I'm writing a book I'm like managing a team I don't know I just feel that's not quite as legit as oh I'm a doctor saving lives on the rig and on the side I'm doing the YouTube thing so I had this fear of like you know if I choose not to be a doctor because it's not really not what I'm passionate about will I be hampering the business will the YouTube channel die because people don't care about what I have to say anymore if I'm not practicing as a doctor and then you know I was talking to a few people about this and Lewis in particular he was like like you know if you were giving health advice then I'd accept that but people don't follow you because because you were giving them advice on how to I don't know Amanda broken bone if all of you because you're different giving hopefully decent kind of advice on how to be more productive or how to be better student or how to live your best life and he felt like no one really cares about whether you're going to a hospital talking to patients for one day in the week or if you're not doing that like no one actually cares and maybe it's mostly in my head rather than in actually the audience's mind so those were one of my two fears broadly the fear of what if I lose everything and be what if the brand dies based on the fact that I'm not a doctor anymore we'll see what happens currently like I said leaning towards and not doing medicine at all because ultimately thing that I passion it about is teaching and I guess the final challenge that we're going to talk about is the thing of making time for myself and trying to enjoy the journey as much as possible because it's all well and good wanting to run a chase more subscribers and more views and more damage on the podcast and all that kind of stuff but ultimately I think the destination is broadly meaningless unless we're enjoying the journey as well and I think for me when I'm just so focused on growing the business and even though it's fun and I don't make time for myself like to go to the gym or to I don't know just hang out with friends and stuff if I don't make time for that then I just feel a lot less whole it feels like I'm enjoying the journey a lot less one thing I'm trying to figure out is the balance like the basically the more hours I spend on the business the more the business grows probably because there's a pretty direct correlation between if I spend an hour writing a YouTube video and putting out that YouTube video you know that that that has benefits for all of the things in the business but you know if I spend an hour going to the gym instead or hanging out with friends that doesn't have that clear kind of monetary return but I'm trying to be more okay with that like that's totally fine and trying to be okay with this idea that the business doesn't need to grow at an exponential rate as long as you know I was thinking we had a session with a business coach the other day which is really helpful but he was like what's your what's your like 10 year target and what do you care about in 10 years time he was encouraging us to put like a number on it like I know it's cool to greatness they say that probably the 10 year target is we want to reach 100 million people every month something like that that's like a really cool target to have it's an interesting number but when I think about what I want from from this business from the channel and stuff X number of years from now I don't think about it in terms of I think generally the thing I care about is I want to have a profitable business I eat one that makes a little bit money profitable business that helps people while having fun and honestly I think if we can do that profitable business the health people while having fun that is like all I really want I don't really care about hitting certain revenue targets or growth metrics or all that kind of stuff and so with that in mind I am trying to be more okay with recognizing that actually given that that's the goal the goal is not 10 million or 100 million given the goal is just profitable having fun helping people I actually should be okay with making more time for myself and going on holiday and not taking the laptop along with me or thinking that I have to have to be turning out of video every single week or twice a week because maybe those in that quantity would help with the business growing more and more but it's not really compatible with hey all I care about it's profitable business helps people while having fun so I don't know we'll see I guess that's the end of the video we've talked a little bit about kind of life update what's going on in the in the in the in the team in my life and what the challenges are if anyone has any advice I'd love to hear it please leave a comment down below if you know something about business or about life or are you just any anything struggle called with you I would love to hear from you in the comments I will be reading all the comments for this video and trying to reply to as many as I can while I'm on the toilet as usual so if you have advice on any of the stuff genuinely will love to hear it this is also a ridiculously long video so if you've got to the end of it I would love for you to leave a clover emoji that's a little thing for these like stupidity long videos a clover emoji because it will be interesting to see how many people actually watch this through to the end but if you have thank you so much really apologize for taking up so much of your time hopefully you've got some a modicum of value out of it and there'll be a playlist here with I don't know like more rambles like this if you do care to go down the rabbit hole of rambles but otherwise hope you have a great day do something better with your time and I'll see you in the next video bye
