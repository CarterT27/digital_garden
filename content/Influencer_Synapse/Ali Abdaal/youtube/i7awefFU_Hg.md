## Transcript
 Hey guys, welcome back to the channel. If you're new here, my name is Ali, I'm a junior doctor working in Cambridge. And in this video, I want to talk about three fantasy book series that I discovered last year and absolutely loves. Number one, the Mistborn series by Brandon Sanderson. Number two, the King Killer Chronicles of which the first book is the name of the wind by Patrick Rothfuss. And number three, the Stormlight Archive, again by Brandon Sanderson, of which the first book is the Way of Kings. Before we get started, I just want to say how excited I am that this video is being sponsored by Audible. Audible is the biggest platform for audiobooks in the world. And I've been using Audible. I've been a paid subscriber of them for the last 18 months or so. If you want, you can sign up to a free trial of Audible by going to audible.com forward slash Ali Abdel. Or if you live in the US, apparently you can text Ali Abdel to 500, 500 and that will magically text you back like a link that lets you sign up for the free trial. And with the free trial, you get Audible for 30 days and you can download any of the books I'm going to mention in this video because they're all available and they're all really good on Audible because I've been listening to them all Audible. You can download them all and you can decide if you like. Okay, so the first series I want to talk about is the Mistborn Trilogy by Brandon Sanderson and the first book in that is called the Final Empire. It's set in this post-apocalyptic world that's ruled by this evil guy called the Lord Rudo who's got these mysterious superpowers that no one knows anything about. Within the series, we follow the story of two members of the Scarp population, I.e. the Underdogs. One of them is called Vin and she is a girl who used to be like a farmer and then ends up moving to the city. And we've got a guy called Kelsear who is the head of a crew of thieves and they try and steal from the ability and give to the poor and all ultimately trying to overthrow the final empire. Alongside this world, we have a magic system which is very, very interesting. There's not a case of waving a wand and casting a spell. Instead, it's a case of different metals having different properties and there are some people of the population who can eat certain bits of metal, which sounds weird when I say that loud. You can eat certain bits of metal and then it can burn those metals inside their own body to then get the power that that metal grants. So, for example, you might be able to burn putter and that would give you super strength or you might be able to burn aluminium or steel and that will allow you to teleconetically push and pull different metals and that would, you know, if used appropriately would allow you to fly by hopping from metal to metal, you know, weird stuff like that but that does make a lot of sense and that's one of the things that we liked about this particular series. Everyone is constrained by these laws of physics that are created in this world and it's very, very clever when you've got two characters fighting one another, how they use the laws of physics and manipulate these different metals to get the advantage and how they use that to fight. It's all, it's all very cool. The reason it's called Mistborn is because there are a few very, very rare people in this whole population who are Mistborn. I either were born with the power to burn all eight of the metals and we find that Vin, this is a main character and tells you who's the other main character. These both are Mistborn and Kelsir has been doing it for a while. Vin just kind of finds out that she's a Mistborn and tells you a kind of trains her up. So you get this duo forming where, you know, it's kind of like a coming of a story. Vin finds out that she's a Mistborn and over time her abilities improve and I don't really want to give away much more than that because you can probably read that from the bloke of the book but it's really, really, really, really good. It has adventure, it's got a bit of action, it's got a lot of interesting political and moral things within it as well to what extent are the poor people morally justified in attacking the rich people. There's this whole kind of backstory about it that you discover as the trilogy progresses. There's all this weird stuff about the Lord Ruler and the final empire and it all builds to a very, very interesting climate. After finishing the Mistborn series, it was January 2018 and I was on my GP placement in this town literally in the middle of nowhere. It was like a two-hour drive from Cambridge and after I finished the Mistborn trilogy and then read the other three books that were released on top of that which are set in a kind of more modern sort of world but still based on similar concepts. After I finished those six books, it was January we were on this placement with not really much to do apart from preparing for our exams and I was feeling super depressed. So I said to my housemate Rachel who was living in this cottage with me. I expressed my disappointment that I'd finished these books and I was like, oh, I don't know what to read next. I don't think anything is ever going to come closer to this and she said that she would highly recommend the name of the wind by Patrick Rothvuss and said that that was the best fantasy book she'd ever read. So then my eyes lit up and I immediately bought it on Kindle and also bought the audiobook because she recommended that the audible narration of it is really really good and then I started reading it and I don't know where the next like eight hours of my life went because I was literally sitting on the the reclining chair in this cottage in the Norfolk coastline and reading the name of the wind by Patrick Rothvuss and it was so good and then I remember we were going home the following day going back to Cambridge so I put the audio book on in the car and we just kind of resumed where I'd left off on Kindle and the narration is absolutely stellar. Again this is a sort of coming of a story. I'm an absolute sucker for coming of a story but the format is a little bit different so we start off with this kind of again a almost a post-apocalyptic world in some of the theme here where we follow the story of this guy in an inn he's an innkeeper. We're here some stuff about the inn and it's a bit and you know there's like demons and stuff and bad things are happening around in the world and everyone's talking about how terrible the world is and this guy the innkeeper his name is Koot he's all mysterious and then we get a visit to the inn from this guy called chronicler who's job it is to write down the stories of famous people and we find that very quickly that actually the innkeeper has this massive massive backstory and is like a wanted man by the kingdom and has all these you know special powers that have been attributed to him through stories over time and what happens is that this innkeeper who's like 35 years old or something at this point decides to sit down with a chronicler and tells his story from when he was like five years old onwards essentially it's another one of those you know kid grows up and finds out he's a wizard sort of stories but but not like that just like you know it's it's really hard to describe a book or the plot of a book in a few words without making it sound really lame but there's this kid he's named his quote he's very prodigious he's got a lot of talents he's very clever very quick with it and he goes around with his troop of circus performers and then one day when he's a bit older an arcaneist comes to the circus and starts teaching him about you know magic and the arcane and then once he's learned a little bit of magic then some like really terrible stuff happens what I don't want to say because it's a big spoiler and that was like oh my god like what the help kind of remember for me when I found that out and then we kind of get a lot more of the backstory and then he goes off to this university which is the university for magic tricks again sounds really lame I apologize but it's really really good and he goes to the university and most of the book is set at the university and we talk about his escapades there and how he makes friends how he actually gets into the university even though he's underage which is a very interesting and there is a very kind of dark undercurrent running through the whole thing where this guy quote is trying to find out information about some evil superpowery godlike creatures who did bad stuff to him and that's kind of the undercurrent of this but it's all like there's a very good mix of where they go to lectures and they have fun and they you know there's a bit of a banter there's a bit of you know friendly rivalry that becomes unfriendly rivalry there's a a little bit of romance it's always nice to get a little bit of romance and it all works towards building up this backstory of who is this guy quote how does he have how is he so famous for having all these amazing things all these stories about these amazing things how do we ultimately get from this you're really nice you know almost flowery butterfly world where he's a circus performer two thirty years later this post-apocalyptic world that's overrun by demons where he becomes a wanted man and that's a very very interesting story so the name of the wind was the first one and the wise man's fear was the second one both of them are absolutely incredible like at one point I had to drive to Manchester in back for a wedding which took like eight hours in total and my moment ground I was sleeping in the car but I was listening to the wise man's fear audiobook and it was just so good it was absolutely bloody incredible and it just made the time absolutely fly you know some this sometimes it was getting to the point where it was getting to a really good bit and I'd just kind of get home put my air pods in lie on the bed and just kind of listen for like four hours and it was like really really good some so glad that I used the audible narration to drew out to the enjoyment of the series and then when doors of stone or walls of stone or whatever the third one is going to be called when that comes out I'm hoping the audible narration comes out alongside because I don't want to devour it on Kindle I actually want to savor it on audible if that makes sense so yeah highly recommend the name of the wind I would kind of recommend reading miss born first if you haven't read any of these start with miss born because miss born is a bit more fast-paced and the name of the wind can get a little bit slow at times the wise man's fear can get a little bit slow at times if you're if you're experienced in the fantasy genre then you will not mind these slow bits in fact you'll probably appreciate and save of them whereas if you're in the market if you're in the market for like a fast-paced thing miss born definitely covers that base a lot more so I'm glad I read miss born first because then it allowed me to save the experience of reading the King Killer Chronicles by Patrick Rothfuss and the final series that I want to talk about is called a stormlight archive again by Brandon Sanderson the same guy who wrote the missed one series of books before I talk about that I just want to mention that Brandon Sanderson all of his books I set in the same cosmare the same kind of universe but they're all in different worlds within the same universe so actually you do get a little bit of overlap between some of the characters and you get kind of recurring themes and you get certain characters that start off in one book and then appear in another book it for a quick cameo and there's a lot of mysteries going on in this whole universe and you know from watching interviews and reading his website it seems like you know over the next like 20 years or so as he releases more and more books stuff will start to coalesce and you know theme and you know characters that we saw for a little bit in miss born then appear in stormlight archive who then appear in this other series and the whole thing is apparently supposed to tie together and like a really planned out way which is really cool that I love the idea that there is there's a plan there's a plan for all of this and even though you know miss born and stormlight archive and all these books are just bloody incredible on their own their part of like a broader picture and it's so exciting to think that you know for the next 20 years there's going to be a solid one or two books coming out every year that's going to fit inside this narrative and yeah it's going to be really cool anyway stormlight archive the first book of that is the way of kings now this is a massive massive book I didn't really appreciate how big it was because I've been listening to this series entirely on audible because by this point you know I started listening to this I think in like September uh 2018 or something like I started listening to it and I remember thinking that there is no way I'm going to get these books on Kindle because I just want to make sure that I save with the experience of all of it so I've been listening to these exclusively on audible and I just didn't really appreciate how long they were like I knew that it takes about 50 hours to get through each one but then I saw the physical books in like my friend's place they bloody massive so like if you look at the book I think it seems very daunting but actually if you listen to the audio book or if you get it on Kindle or whatever you like then it's it's a really good duration it's a solid many many many hours of and actually the main reason that I now listen to these exclusively on audible is because it encourages me to go to the gym anyway let's talk about the book itself the first one is called The Way of Kings now this is more like you know the standard fantasy book that you would expect that's sort of like Game of Thrones and that it's we we hear the story from multiple different characters perspectives and at this star we don't really know what's going on we're like we get a little snippet of this little snippet of that but then after a while stuff starts to kind of combine and you sort of build up the picture in your head I think the star of it is a bit slow but you know once you battle through the first few chapters it becomes absolutely incredible so what's it about we follow the story of a few different characters firstly there is a guy called Caladin and he you know we start off in the present and then we find out snippet of his backstory and he is the son of a surgeon he grew up training to be a surgeon but then he gets conscripted into the army and becomes really good in the army but then he gets chucked out away from the army and we're not quite sure why and he becomes a slave and as a slave he tries to revolt he tries to lead his fellow slaveers out into freedom but that never works and it's a very sad but also very inspiring story of you know this one guy and how he's being downtrodden so much he's in this absolutely horrific circumstance but finds the you know finds the will to bring his people together and try and rise up and again that sounds really lame when I explain it but it's really really good so he's kind of one character he's this warrior turn slave surgeon sort of guy and we've got this other person who is a girl she goes to this city to try and become the apprentice of this famous powerful woman who's like a scholar so this girl is super into heart and history and stuff but actually we find out that while she's there she's not just there to be a scholar she's there to steal from this lady and to try and bring her family back into into repute because their family is a bit screwed because of some stuff that I father did and again there's a whole backstory behind that these characters start off with zero interaction but then as the series progresses they start to interact more and more and it's all very interesting how it comes together and I don't want to give too much away because it's just so good and I appreciate now that you know thinking back to this last hour that I spent recording this video a lot of it is me just saying how good something is so if you trust me then you know take my word for it this is bloody incredible series it's so so good it's it's a bit slow in some places but again I'm glad I read this third you know misborn then king killer and then this one because now even in the slow bits I kind of still save of them I recognize that there's going to be hints and stuff from all for all the mysteries throughout even these slow bits and then when it gets to the really fast based bits that's when you know this is probably the most exciting out of all the books that I'd read last year and this year because I found myself like I'd be listening to the audiobook in the car rather gym and it would get to like a really good bit and then I would just get home and sit on the sofa and just you know get a cup of tea and for the next like eight hours I'd just sit there listening to it and it's just so so good and I genuinely have tears in my eyes at several points whether we're like oh my god moments where like serious stuff was going down and I just couldn't even fathom how this was all coming together and it was just incredible so um yes and that is the way of kings which is the first book of the storm like archives the second book is words radians the third book is oath bringer which I'm currently listening to and then he's writing the fourth and the fifth one and there's going to be another five books in the series over the next 20 years or so so the really nice thing about this is that if you start reading the reading or listening to these books now then you'll have a solid 20 years of solid entertainment ahead of you because Brandon Sanderson is going to deliver and it's going to be wonderful and I really can't wait so that brings us to the end of the video before we wrap up I just want to say big thank you to audible again for sponsoring this video I have been gushing about audible for the last one year since I've started this youtube channel um it's just an incredible service and actually I'm going to make a video at some point about the purchases that have added the most value to my life and my camera is one of them my Kindle is another one and audible is probably the third on the list like I'm so glad I have an audible subscription and I'd be saying that even if it weren't sponsoring this video so please don't think that you know the only reason I'm plugging audible is because they are sponsoring this video which is just like a really nice happy side effect so if you want you can sign up to a 30 day free trial by going to audible.com forward slash Aliabdal and with that you can literally download any of the books that I've mentioned in this video for free so if you want to start listening to the Mistborn series or to start listening to the name of the wind you can just sign up to your free trial of audible using my link and then you can get that book for free which is wonderful and I'll put links to all the audibles and the Kindle's of all the books in the description below and if you're a viewer from the US apparently you can text Aliabdal to 500 500 500 and that will magically send you a link to your phone but yeah audible has like a massive library of audio books the biggest library in the world of audiobooks and each month they have these exclusive audiobooks exclusive titles which are either bits of theatre or bits of literature or bits of other books kind of how Netflix has their own original content audible has its own original content as well which is really solid and there's also all of the standard self-help books that you would expect for self-improvement for working out and it's just got a massive library of stuff I use it personally mostly for the fantasy the fiction stuff because I think when it comes to nonfiction I prefer having it on Kindle so I can highlight but when it comes to fiction I prefer the ability to savor it over a long period of time you know listening to people who are really really good narrators narrating this whole story and doing all the fancy voices and stuff so yeah it's just absolutely incredible for that so yeah thank you audible for sponsoring this video and thank you for watching this as well this has been very very roughly I'm not too good at doing this book review thingy I did a previous video about three nonfiction books that changed my life and that felt quite roughly as well but you know I quite enjoyed it and there's just kind of chatting to a camera trying to explain the plot of a book without giving too much of a way of other plot of the book and then ending up just being like oh you know just take my word for it because it's it's really good and I can't tell you why it's really good because that will ruin it but I just yeah it's really good anyway yeah misborn name of the wind the way of kings incredible books start with misborn I'd recommend if you haven't read any of them it's absolutely sick thank you very much for watching if you like the video please give it a thumbs up if you haven't subscribed to the channel please consider doing so have a lovely day and I'll see you in the next video goodbye
