## Transcript
 Hey friends, welcome back to the channel. In this video, I interviewed one of the respiratory meds and specialists consultants at my hospital called Dr. Thomas and he shared 10 things that we can do right now to help combat the spread of the coronavirus that's causing COVID-19 that's taking over the world basically. Everything is going to be linked in timestamps in the video description and in a pinned comment so you can jump around the video if you feel like it and I will start with a very quick summary of everything that we discuss. So if you don't have too much time to watch this video, at least you'll get like the most bang for your buck out of it. So firstly, we talked about importance of not panicking and preparedness being the key rather than panicking. Secondly, we should all be following the instructions from a high command. So in the UK, we should be following the advice of public health England and the government and this applies to whichever country that you're in. Thirdly, we talked a lot about social distancing and what that actually looks like and why it's so important. And then we talked about the importance of avoiding physical contact with elderly relatives because they are by far more vulnerable than young fit healthy people. Point number five was conditions for self isolation and the point we made was that basically this situation is so rapidly evolving that you should always like consult the guidance from above whenever you're watching this video but at the moment the advice is that if you're symptomatic then you should quarantine like self isolate yourself for 14 days because that's how long based on the research we think the disease is infectious for. Point number six is really important to keep up your physical health mental health and everything exercising during the pandemic just not doing it in crowds or with other people. Point number seven is the importance of washing our hands especially when we're coming into an out of the house. We've just been to work when we're coming back home from work after we've handled anything that's has contact with the outside world. Point number eight please stop smoking it's really really important. Point number nine avoid comparing what's happening in your own country in our country in the UK wherever you're watching this with what's happening in other countries. The system epidemiology, the sort of healthcare resources in different countries are markety different and so the advice from country to country is going to differ. Yeah sure maybe everyone in Hong Kong is wearing face masks but the advice for us in the UK is to not wear face masks for example. I'm point number ten we addressed this classic issue of kind of the young people not taking the seriousness and thinking you know well I'm young and I'm fit and healthy and I don't care if I could it's I'm gonna be asymptomatic but it's not about you if you're young I'm young I'm pretty fit and healthy but I'm still social distancing I'm still isolating myself because it's not about me it's about the wider population and I do not want to be responsible for people's death because I've passed the virus on to someone else who's more susceptible to it. So that was a quick summary of the things that we talked about and now for the rest of the video it'll be Dr. Thomas sharing his professional expert level advice as a respiratory medicine consultant as a specialist about what we can be doing the ten things we could be doing to help reduce the spread of the pandemic and basically how to respond well to it. Here we go panic is one of the things that we shouldn't do because it doesn't help anybody. This panic that spreads more widely than the virus which can be very very harmful so it's it's important that we try and sort of wind that down and sort of ramp up our preparedness in the right sort of way okay so prepared not panicking. Prepare not panicking definitely you know we're fighting a war but we're doing it sensibly we need each one of you to be able to get this right. You have to keep up because the instructions change on a day to their basis because of this process of trying to contain the virus so if you were to think about that analogy of war if we don't follow instructions from high command we have a lot more information that we do things can go completely wrong. To make it simple the department of help tells you exactly what you should do as a member of public at any given time. Follow those instructions you know where we are right now today is the the 21st of March. What would you say of the most important things that we as the general public should be doing? Social distancing is really important driving through Cambridge's number of cars that were coming into town. That worries me you know the fact that people are not listening to the suggestion that we should sort of be winding down on social activity. The reason I'm saying that is because of virus spreads from one individual to another if you are in close contact of less than a meter you're more likely to get the virus spread to yourselves. If we slow the spread of the virus down what that then allows us to do is to be able to deal with the people who are really sick in a past manner you know so if we all get the virus quickly together the number of people who die goes up you're actually saving lives by following the simple instruction of social isolation and distancing. So this is really important at this stage of the epidemic where we are today you need to protect your elderly relatives you need to protect those who are vulnerable and the way to find out who those people are is to go to the NHS England website and they actually have a list of people. The general list is people with chronic respiratory disease, people with chronic heart disease, diabetics, people who are vulnerable because of recent chemotherapy for cancers, people who are immunosuppress because of immune conditions and so on and so forth. So there's a long list of conditions. The principle of social isolation is gone beyond that elderly people in particular are also a little more vulnerable than the general population and we know that very clearly from the data that we have from Italy. If you care for your elderly grandfather or grandmother you need to make sure that social distancing works for them that doesn't mean that you shouldn't have social contact because there are so many different ways in which we can have social contact and it may be that we need to do that more now by say electronic means what about the whole kind of sort of self isolation self quarantine type thing like what advice would you have for people about you know when do I know whether to self isolate or to quarantine myself. There's been deferring guidance on this. There's been a time when they said self isolate for seven days and then all of a sudden it's changed to 14 days and it's been very the reason why this has been different is that we were in different stages of this epidemic. The government felt at a certain time we were fine to be self-isolating for seven days. Now that's increased of 14 days. However as of yesterday we all know that we shouldn't be going to pubs gathering in you know in public places you know football matches been cancelled a lot of events and concerts been that is having a profound effect on people's lives and we can't take that away. It doesn't mean to say that you shouldn't go out you know would it be okay if I got up early and meant for a run. Yes please do you must go if you're on get your exercise you know as long as you're not sort of running with it with a team or running the mouth whether our shed loads of people running together I would recommend that you definitely exercise keep fit try and get your sleep and if you're worried about your you know your mental health stress avoid alcohol I'm preparing myself as if I was preparing for a marathon okay and that's exactly what it is. I can't emphasize that message more you know if there was a time to wash your hands and for all of us to wash our hands now's the time you know so wash your hands when you come back home before you eat your food up after you've eaten your food before you leave your house and there are simple things like when you open doors you know if you've touched a door handle remember the door handle could have areas of could potentially have had a virus on it you know and that could that could spread to someone else and possibly to yourself as well so all of these simple measures continue throughout the whole epidemic and should continue for the rest of our lives ideally so simple things like stopping smoking could potentially save your life because it actually allows saying an asthmatic for it inhaler to work better if you stop smoking so this is a good time you know as a chess physician I have to get that in and if you need help with stopping smoking there are a lot of websites there are national websites there are local websites that you can go to to try and address that the effects are stopping smoking are almost felt immediately within minutes to hours to days and then the benefits just keep accumulating as a time goes by if you stayed off the cigarettes so certainly you're more vulnerable to getting a vital infection if you're a current smoker then if you've stopped smoking so if I were to say to you then in two weeks time there's going to be this high likelihood that you might get this vital infection you should certainly stay off your cigarettes I'd also encourage you to try not to compare healthcare organizations across the world it we can't help doing that however it's really important that we don't do that because what is right for America under the current circumstances different to what is right for us in Britain for our health service what is right for Italy is different to what is right for South Korea and Japan and so on they kind of epidemiological interventions that you would do would depend on your healthcare system the nation the population of the country for instance India is a population of over a billion 50% of their population is less than 28 years old so if you start comparing mortality figures of Italy it has a high population of elderly people you know who are more vulnerable to this particular virus and say death rates that we're seeing coming out which is very serious you know it can be frightening and you might think that actually India is getting it right but Italy and Italy is getting it wrong and that's the wrong thing to do what would you say as a respiratory physician to those people you know that minority of people that says you know I'm young I'm fit I don't care if I get the disease it's only the old people that we have to worry about but you know I'll I'll be fine and therefore I'm gonna go about my life as if if nothing's going on what would you say to those sorts of people as a young person you have a social responsibility and we have a social responsibility for our loved ones who are vulnerable so you will have a grandfather or a grandmother or you will have a brother or a sister think of what you can do for that grandfather or grandmother by doing things such as social isolation what you're doing with social isolation is preventing that curve going exponentially up you're flattening the curve so that's the first thing that you can do as a young person the second thing that I would say to a young person is it is not only the elderly the vulnerable who are affected why is it that there are some 30 year olds who are coming into intensive care units with COVID-19 so if you think about our lives you know we go about our lives and we we deal with most problems as young people however among us there will always be people who have vulnerabilities you might have an immune deficiency some other medical problem which wasn't apparent but unless your system or your body was stressed only that would then point towards this particular vulnerability or the virus itself the load of the virus that you've been exposed to because you when the pandemic is at its max you don't follow these basic hygiene principles and rules and you go out you go to a nightclub or you have a raven your room or something you know where there are shed loads of people together then use you know and then if there are people who have a particular say strain of this virus because these viruses they they're RNA viruses which can mutate kind of just to sum up everything that we talked about we've said that this coronavirus of course is COVID-19 it's a very big deal like in capital letters it's got a significant mortality we don't yet really know what the long term morbidity of it is going to be and we know we're at that point where there are things that we as individuals and as a collective can do to make a difference which are things like social distancing and isolation once we have the symptoms and the idea behind that whole thing is that we want to flatten the curve of the pandemic such that we don't overburden our healthcare system because if that were to happen and we like literally run out of intensive care and ventilators at that point we start having to make decisions about who lives and who dies and that is not a place we want to get to but we hope that by social distancing by our situation by washing our hands by doing all these measures that are being recommended from central command from the top by public health England we kind of flattened the curve we spread the course of the pandemic out over time and if we do that yes it might last months it might even last years but the longer it lasts the more our healthcare system we'll have the capacity to deal with it and the more time we give our researchers and our colleagues working on cure working on vaccines we give them the time to find something that works and in the meantime doctors in other areas are being redeployed to the front lines trying essentially by this group of people time so it seems like a really collective group effort that we're all doing absolutely yeah so as Boris Johnson would say you know at the end of the speech don't forget to wash your heart to wash your hands. All right well thank you very much okay really that's fun. All right so that was the 10 tips the things that we can do right now to help prevent the spread of coronavirus to help manage the pandemic to help flatten the curve so that our health system is not overwhelmed and I say big thank you to Dr Thomas for taking the time to record this video and sharing his expert advice with us and yeah I guess all this left to say is stay safe stay healthy stay happy as Dr Mike would say I shouldn't probably steal that slogan thanks for watching and we'll see you in the next video bye bye hopefully bye
