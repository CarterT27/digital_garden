## Transcript
 Hey friends, welcome back to the channel to Tech Club, the ongoing series where I review tech and apps and other products that have the potential to add value to both of our lives, yours and mine. And this episode is going to be a little bit different because I'm going to talk you through 27, yes 27 apps that have shaped the course of my life from the age of 11 through to the age of about 28. And for each of these apps, I'm going to share the way that it's influenced my life so that hopefully you can get some ideas for how you might want to apply these apps or similar apps to your own life as well. As always, there's going to be timestamps down below so do feel free to skip around if you feel like it. And very excitingly, this video is very kindly sponsored by Adobe Creative Cloud, but I'll tell you more about that in just a moment. Let's move on to our first app. And app number one is in fact notepad. I discovered the wonders of notepad when I was around about 11 years old and notepad was the first app that I would say has shaped the course of my life because I learned how to code by using notepad. I taught myself HTML and CSS using the internet, essentially back in the day it was a website called W3Schools and taught myself how to code essentially making.html pages on notepad and seeing how they would render in internet explorer. I think it was internet explorer six or internet explorer five at the time, the browser and it was really through notepad that I made my first website. And this bug that I had for creating websites was something that served me for such a long time and even now today, I still think it's really really valuable for people to learn how to code. If you're watching this and you're interested in starting a side hustle or making money on the side or anything like that, learning how to code is a remarkably useful skill, not just the domain of software engineering for example, you know, learning to code learning how to make websites and we've got a few more apps in the rest of this video that are going to be themed around to this building website thing. The other websites is open up so many doors for my life, even when I was in medical school and beyond and it's just a skill that I, yeah, just could not recommend highly enough. This brings us on nicely to app number two, which is Dream Leaver. Now at the time, when I was using Dream Leaver, it was called macro media Dream Leaver. It's now called Adobe Dream Leaver and it's the app that I first learned how to properly design and code websites on around the age of 12 or 13. And again, Dream Leaver really shaped the course of my life because it really leveled up my web design staff and it meant that from age 13 onwards, I was a building my own website projects as side hustles when I was in school and B, I was also masquerading as a sort of freelance web developer on the internet and offering my services to small businesses and making sort of $5 here and there because I was coding stuff using no pad and using Dream Leaver and building websites for people and that was a way for me to make money on the internet and again, that bug of entrepreneurship and entrepreneurialism that I got through, making my first several dollars on the internet. Again, served me for the rest of my life and will probably continue to do so and I put a lot of my, I guess, business and YouTube channel in like life success in a better commerce down to this streak of entrepreneurialism that I got and I have to thank no pad and Dream Leaver in particular for kind of introducing me to the world of web development. And related to web development is web design, which I first learned on Photoshop. Yes, Photoshop CS2 created sweet too. Again, web back when I was like 13 years old because initially I was right kind of writing HTML and CSS code on Notepad and through Dream Leaver but then I realized I want to make logos and I want to make fancy banners and I want to make like four of signatures and so I managed to get hold of a copy of Adobe Photoshop CS2 at the time and to taught myself how to use Photoshop and to do this kind of web design stuff. And so now when I was making money on the internet and doing my own personal project, it wasn't just a development that I was doing, it was also a web design. Again, this is an app that has shaped my life because the skill of designing websites and designing graphics was a skill that I then used throughout my school years up until 18. I used it throughout medical school to design brochures and flyers for university societies. I used it to design medical technology apps which got me hired as a freelance app and user interface designer while I was in med school which helped me make about ¬£100 an hour. That was the rate that I was charging back in the day. And ultimately this love for design was the thing that made my YouTube channel this YouTube channel look legit even five years ago when I was getting started out. And so I do a lot of my success to Photoshop and to the web and graphic design skills that it taught me. And even now I still used Photoshop for designing websites and for designing thumbnails and for kind of mocking up things for my YouTube channel and for the rest of the business. And that's one of the reasons why I'm delighted to say that this video is sponsored by Adobe Adobe absolutely dream brand work with because I had literally been using their stuff. Since the age of like 11, so the last 17 years of my life. Now back in the day when you wanted to use things like Photoshop and dream weaver and like light room and after effects and audition and all of the other tools in the Adobe Creative Suite it was called Creative Suite back in the day. You had to buy each piece of software individually but these days it's super easy because Adobe have this thing called Creative Cloud which I have been a subscriber of since I don't know like 2015 or so. And very excitingly they've got a ridiculously good deal if you're a student. Right now I'm not a student so I pay full price for Adobe Creative Cloud as does everyone else on our team because it comes with all of the different Adobe software for photography or video editing or graphic design or web design basically like audio design. All of the things are all associated and included with Adobe Creative Cloud. But if you're a student or a teacher you can actually get 65% off the first year subscription and so even if you're on a student budget it makes it the absolutely perfect subscription to sign up for because it includes Photoshop and Dreamweaver and Lightroom and After Effects and audition and like any other Adobe app that you can basically use to kick start your passion project or your side hustle or help you with your academic stuff you can really use the Adobe Suite for absolutely anything. Anyway if you want to try out any of the Adobe software lots of which has changed and shaped my life personally you can hit the link in the video description or scan this QR code is going to be on screen and that will give you a free completely free seven-day trial to the Adobe Creative Cloud and then you can subscribe after that if you would like to. So thank you so much Adobe for sponsoring this video and for creating these apps that have really helped shake my life. So app number four wasn't in fact a world of warcraft which I don't have a lot to say at about otherwise other than it shaped my life for three years where I was playing it for an average of three and a half hours each day. Through that I became good friends with to my school friends Chris and Omar and we're still friends to this day and it's the game that helped me appreciate why gaming is so fun. Sadly I kind of lost touch with gaming a little bit over the last like 10 years since starting university but it is something I want to dabble with more. I've got Elden Ring on the PS5 and want to have a go at that some point when I figure out how to make enough time in my day to actually play video games. App number five is in fact Kindle and I first got a Kindle back in 2009 and I've been reading books on Kindle basically ever since then and the reason I'm calling it app is because well Kindle has an app now. Essentially the great thing about that is that anytime I get any kind of recommendation for any kind of book I can just buy it on Kindle basically immediately and gets delivered to my device my phone or my Kindle or my iPad or my Mac immediately and I can just start reading it immediately. I've made tons of videos talking about how Kindle is just one of the most life-changing purchases or apps that I've ever used. I'm not going to wax too much on about it but if you have not yet started reading ebooks really something I'd recommend I do like reading physical books as well it's kind of nice but just the conveniences of an ebook just I think far outweigh the benefits of reading a physical book since I started using Kindle and because I used Kindle and read on the Kindle app on my iPad and my phone my Kindle ferry regularly is just meant that I'm able to read somewhere between 50 and 100 books a year. Obviously you know just reading books for its own sake is not inherently useful but I think over the last like 18 years of my life I've absorbed so much really useful kind of information and content and learnings through the meeting of books that if it hadn't been for the Kindle app I don't think it would have been anywhere near as easy for me to do that as it was so again thank you Kindle for being a sick app definitely try a Kindle if you haven't already app number six on our list isn't really an app and I'm going to call it an app because the word app sort of app website tool whatever and it's in fact WordPress now WordPress is a kind of website builder and it powers I think around 30% of the internet these days but I started using WordPress when I was I think around 14 or 15 when I was doing this freelance web development graphic design type stuff because those are people's websites would be hosted on WordPress and when people would want me to make a website for them I would just generally buy a WordPress template off of theme forest and then I would just edit the template and they would think oh my god this website is sick how did you do that and WordPress is great because it lets people actually edit the text of their own website without having to know how to code so from about the age of 15 to about the age of 25 I was using WordPress at least every week if not potentially every day my whole first business six med was built on top of WordPress websites and WordPress themes and I've just spent so much time working with WordPress I don't really like it anymore I prefer Ghost which I'm going to talk about in a little bit but I have to say WordPress shaped the course of my life and even to this day WordPress powers 30% plus of the internet and so if you're interested in potentially moonlighting or side hustling as a web designer or web developer learning WordPress is actually a really really really useful skill that makes you highly employable and highly in demand from people who host the websites on WordPress which as I said is like 30% of the internet then we fast forward a little bit to starting medical school so in 2012 I started my first year of medical school and within a few months of medical school I discovered a completely life-changing app called Ankey and Key is a completely free flash card app available on all devices Mac Windows, phone etc etc and it's great because it's flash cards in digital format and it's completely free and so I used Ankey extensively throughout my time in medical school it made memorizing random aspects that you have to do as a medical student so much easier because it's got this sort of space reputation algorithm built into it again I've made a ton of videos in Ankey in the past I even have a Skillshare class on it I'll pull that put that down below and up there if you want to check it out amazing app if you need to learn anything if you have lots of stuff you need to memorize if you're trying to learn a language and Key is just absolutely sick for that kind of stuff and next another technique that I discovered which really helped me throughout medical school was in fact the Pomodoro technique which you've probably heard of basically you work for 25 minutes let me take a five minute break and then you repeat this times four and then you take a half an hour break and the Pomodoro method was essentially how I would work with my friends in different libraries around Cambridge where I went to university now it's kind of two ways that we would tie myself when it came to the Pomodoro method firstly we would use a website called tomato timer I think that's what it was called but it was just a random website you can just Google the phrase Pomodoro timer and we'll pop up a free website that lets you time that but a few years into medical school I discovered a really good app for the phone called forest and forest is great because forest is like basically a Pomodoro timer you set a timer for 25 minutes but in those 25 minutes it's sort of locks you out of your phone and if you try and go on your phone or get distracted by notifications as you're working it plants a tree and the tree grows but if you go off that and you get distracted then the tree dies again it's just a little bit of fun it's basically a glorified 25 minute tomato timer but the fact that you're killing a tree allegedly when you don't get distracted meant that I was getting not distracted and it would kind of you know there's leaderboard and stuff and we'd kind of end up in a bit of a competition with our friends for who can do the most Pomodoro's in a day it's just a bit of friendly conversation just a bit of fun but I found that that app really helped me focus a while I was studying for my exam then meant school which is why the Pomodoro technique is one of the apps broadly that has helped shape my life. Next up we are continuing medical school and we are continuing the web development saga with the three apps in particular that shaped my life while I was in med school and that is firstly sublime text sublime text is still around actually it is a essentially a very lightweight glorified version of notepad but when I was coding websites for my first business I made these sort of question banks for medical students to help them get into medical beam out and you can't ninja which required a lot of like front-end and back-end development using PHP and HTML and CSS and JavaScript and all these fun coding languages that I kind of learnt when I was younger but hounded my skills in throughout medical school. I was using sublime text as my lightweight text editor of choice and those apps that I made those websites that I built ended up kind of making me decent chunks of money while I was at university and ended up meaning that I didn't really have to worry about money at university because this business that I made helped people get into med school was generating enough income and there were few enough people at the time I think it's much more crowded now but at the time there were few enough people doing this and doing it well that my skills in web design and web development really helped our business stand out from the crowd and so I really owe a lot to kind of being in the right place at the right time and having the right skills again knowing how to code knowing how to make websites which is still stupidly useful to this day that sublime text was really the app that brought it all together. Next on the list we have the Laravel PHP framework. This is a bit technical not technically an app but it sort of isn't app again depends on your definition of app. I'd been kind of doubling with PHP which is a coding language since I think the age of about 14 but I was using very much of vanilla PHP just like the absolute barebones basic essentials and doing a lot of like really really bad coding and the grand scheme of things but then when I was in my second year of university I discovered the Laravel PHP framework and a website called Lara Custs where a chap called Jeffrey Way who's a developer would teach tutorials on how to use Laravel and how to program in PHP properly and I would watch those tutorials while I would be having my lunch when I was at university and through osmosis I just learned so much about web development in PHP and then I used this Laravel framework to develop these two websites b-mat and you can't ninja which ended up making decent chunks of money so thank you Laravel PHP framework for being sick and it's still really good it's still very much actively in development so if you're interested in learning to code if you're interested in using PHP potentially then I can't recommend the Laravel framework highly enough and associated with that we have app number 11 which is in fact stripe. Now back in the day I can't remember how long I got a good as well but back in the day was actually surprisingly hard to accept payments on the internet these days it's super easy thanks mostly to stripe which is a company that's made it super super easy for developers to accept payments on the internet and so using stripe made it super easy to collect payments for our courses but also to collect payments for this b-mat and you can't question bank that I built and before that you had to like hack around with PayPal PayPal the total nightmare but stripe and learning how to use stripe and learning how to use stripe checkout and the other features associated with stripe again just helped our business become profitable basically from day one so thank you stripe for that and again stripe is still used by loads of people around the world to essentially accept payments so if you're again learning to code if you're a coder if you're a developer you almost certainly heard of stripe because it's absolutely huge but that wasn't that really shaped I guess because of my business and therefore the course of my life all right next we have app number 12 which is in fact a Google Drive I started putting everything on Google Drive I think for my first year of university onwards because I had a hard drive failure and lost everything before that point and I decided never again and Google Drive was the one that made the most sense because I was using Gmail I was using my Google account for everything I didn't have an iPhone at the time and I cloud drive hadn't did not exist at the time but basically since 2012 I've had my entire life on Google Drive and one of the main ways in which this I guess shaped my life was the fact that I made this sort of shared Google Drive for all the medical students in my college and we would all share essay plans together and share revision notes and stuff and through having this shared Google Drive it made all of our studying way more effective and more efficient and streamlined all of our collective processes of getting through medical school because we were all sharing notes and resources it's a thing that I encourage every other student to do as well I think it's very easy for students to feel competitive like they're competing with the other students in that class but I found that the more collaborative you are as a student the more easy life becomes and Google Drive and other things like Dropbox and stuff but Google Drive I mean everyone has a Google account Google Drive just made it super easy to share notes with friends then we fast forward a couple years to 2016 and 2016 is when I first started listening to podcasts and I think the first podcast I started listening to was the Tim Ferriss Show back in 2016 and that was using an app called Overcast and then later an app called Castro so I'm going to lump those in one basically podcast listening apps again shaped the course of my life because over the over the next five years I consumed probably over a thousand podcast episodes of different podcasts and through listening to podcasts I got introduced to so many new ideas so many new thinkers and authors and entrepreneurs and creators and listening to podcasts of other people starting YouTube channels made me feel that oh starting a YouTube channel feels reasonable I used to listen to a bunch of podcasts in the indie hackers podcast in particular because it was interviews with developers and coders and people who built profitable businesses from their bedrooms and so listening to the stories and there was super inspiring and again really helped shape the way that I built websites and stuff while I was at university I've got a video up there 12 podcasts that changed my life something like that as a title but you can check that out if you want to get more specific podcast recommendations and then we have app number 14 which is Ghost now Ghost is a website hosting platform kind of like WordPress but better more simpler our WordPress again that sort of became super bloated over time and it's still very bloated like that it powers like 30% of the internet if not more so it kind of has to be the every the everything tool it has to be able to do everything whereas Ghost was specifically a blogging platform blogging software so when I first started my website and took my website seriously in 2016 I built it on Ghost and to this day six years later the website still runs on Ghost Ghost to sick and it was really through starting my website and starting to write articles on the internet that I first got over that initial fear the initial hurdle of putting myself out there and a year later you're in a half later that's what ultimately formed into this YouTube channel so if you're looking to start a website start a blog ghost is actually a very reasonable way of doing it I'll put a video up there my ultimate guide to starting a website you can start on Ghost it's free I think it's free or it's like super cheap I mean we pay a lot for it these days because we get so much value out of Ghost but I think it's a really great way to start learning how to build a website all right next we come to app number 15 which is no stability now this was around 2017 when I first got an iPad Pro and I decided that was gonna go paperless and I did a bunch of research into all the different note-taking apps and no stability was the one that I found most useful and from that point onwards for my final two years of medical school I was essentially fully paperless so I would scan all my text well I wouldn't scan them I would get PDF versions of all my text books I would scan all my lecture notes and I would take handwritten notes in in lectures and in sessions at the hospital and so this shaped my life and firstly kind of making it way easier for me to study wherever I was which because I was kind of going the sort of to various hospital placements here and there and then I couldn't really be bothered to log around books and it meant that I could carry my iPad in the hospital with me wherever I went which made my studying just a bit more efficient but it also meant that when I started making videos on this YouTube channel I made a video called how I take notes on my iPad Pro using this app no stability and that video was the first video that I had that went completely viral and so that video also shaped the course of my life and so I have to kind of not ultimately thank no stability for being that keystone that was that was there on my iPad Pro and helped me get through my school but that also helped my YouTube channel take off around the same time 2017 or when I discovered audible I'd been hearing an audible on the grapevine and on YouTube channels for years at that point but how is that ah audio books who cares but then I think it was just enough people recommended audible to me that I was like okay you know what I might as well give this a try and I've never once looked back I listened to probably many hours of audible every week it's mostly fiction to be honest that I listened to you guys know Brandon Sanderson my favorite author of all time all of his books and audible are absolutely incredible and recently been re-listening to words of radiance which is book two of the Stormlight Archive in fact I just finished it yesterday so I'm going to be starting the reread of book three of bringer be a audible sick I'd be listening to audible audiobooks when I was at the gym and when I was kind of commuting to and from work into and from placement in medical school and now as I walked to and from the studio I listened to audiobooks so yeah 100% recommend audible if you haven't I mean you must have heard of it by now everyone talks about audible there's not even sponsored by audible I just love it so much and so I 100% recommend trying it out if you haven't yet app number 17 that shaped the course of my life is an app called sketch now sketch is not actually that popular these days it's sort of been superseded by apps like Figma and in fact Adobe XD but sketch was sort of a really useful tool back in the day for designing websites and being able to sort of quickly mock up websites and then kind of transfer that into CSS code and stuff and essentially using sketch I did a whole redesign of all my websites for my business but I also started doing a bunch of user interface design and I'll be using a combination of Photoshop and sketch and putting those together to design kind of screens and interfaces for various medical technology apps this was around about 2017 when I was in my fifth, sixth year of medical school again this ties nicely into the thing I was like 10 years after I first started learning how to design websites I'm still doing web design and app design and because of this ability that I had as a medical student to design apps and make them look pretty so many doors opened up for me in terms of like plastic surgeons that I wanted to become friends with and things that I wanted to get involved with where they were various different doctors and consultants needed a person who had a medical background who also knew how to make websites so open up a bunch of doors again just speak to the power of learning how to code learning how to design potentially websites and apps interfaces super useful skill for anyone even today all right app number 18 unsurprisingly is YouTube started my YouTube channel in June 2017 completely changed my life don't need to talk too much about that and app number 19 is an app called Podia which is the service that I used at the time and still used to the state to host my online courses so I made three online courses about the beam out to the UCAT and medical school interviews this was just as a leaving medical school I'd been teaching courses for these exams up until that point and I thought you know what let's turn it into an online course because I don't have the time when I'm going to be working as a doctor I'm not going to have the time to be able to physically teach courses on the weekends so I basically compare everything I knew using my knowledge of how to make videos and edit videos into these online courses and those are hosted on Podia so you can check it out if you want if you have an online course you might like to host it on something like Podia there are a few other alternatives out there this teachable this time card this could jarbe because a few others but Podia is usually the one that I recommend because it's the one that I first started off with in 2017 continuing on the journey we only have about eight apps left you'll be pleased to know app number 20 is in fact notion again don't talk about notion too much but notion essentially shaped my life because it helped me create systems and streamline processes for creating YouTube videos and people always ask like how did you make YouTube videos when you were working full time and how did you do stuff while you were a medical student the answer to the working full-time question is basically just building systems using notion so building like content creation systems and like content repurposing systems and IT generation systems notion made it super easy to do that and that meant that I was able to bang out one or two videos every week even while I was working full time so I owe a lot of that to notion and I even have a Skillshare cast that I've released recently about exactly how I use notion that be linked down below if you want to check it out you can access it completely for free now we're fast forwarding through to about 2019 when the next app happened number 21 that changed my life all that shaped my life is in fact Twitter yes I had not taken Twitter seriously up until 2019 until after repeated episodes of our podcast not a thinking my brother badgered me into taking Twitter seriously and then in 2019 in sort of late 2019 was when I started actually being active on Twitter now we've grown to over 200,000 followers in Twitter follow me on Twitter if you aren't already but at the time I only had like a few hundred or a few thousand followers just by default because people just found me through the YouTube channel but I started making friends with people like Thomas Frank and Sarah D.C. and although YouTube is who I had been watching and admiring for some time and it was really through Twitter that I made friends with these guys and girls and I still say to all the students of my part time YouTuber Academy that Twitter is the single best platform to make friends if you are a creator because every other creator also seems to be on Twitter a lot of the friends I now have our friends that I originally made through one of us DMing the other on Twitter and being like hey we have a mutual respect and appreciation of each other's work let's be friends and I've met like in the last six months of a bunch of people in real life as kind of borders have opened up post lockdown that I've initially met through Twitter and secondly Twitter has really helped shape my life because if you follow the right people on Twitter it just gives you a stream of really interesting thoughtful stuff that you can read or watch or listen to so to be honest most of the recommendations that I get for books or blog posts or podcasts or documentaries or anything like that I get from Twitter and so it's it's really helped shape my life in that sense as well so I guess moral of the story is if you are not yet on Twitter and you still view Twitter as being a stupid pointless platform to just complain about the news then it's because you're not following the right people if you follow the right people and if you want to know how you can look at my profile and see who I follow and if you vibe with any of those guys you can follow them as well but if you follow the right people Twitter becomes a fantastic source of anything like content or blog posts or articles or papers or about literally anything that you're interested in it's just a fantastic resource or round. At number 22 that shaped my life is transistor transistor is how we host my podcast times two firstly I have not overthinking which is a podcast that I've been doing with my brother every week ish for about three and a half years now damn it's been three and a half years we started it in 2019 and that's hosted on transistor. Similarly my podcast deep dive with Ali Adel is also hosted on transistor and again Twitter friends with the guys who create a creative transistor they're really good it's a fantastic app if you want to start a podcast I'll put a link down below if you want to check it out and then number 23 that shaped my life is in fact Skillshare yes I started making classes on Skillshare in late 2019 and and now I'm very open about this Skillshare classes make us about 50 to 80 thousand dollars a month thanks to the fact that I've put about 12 13 classes on Skillshare and every time people watch them which they can watch for free with a Skillshare free trial then we get paid like a few cents for every minute that someone watches the course and with enough courses and with enough people watching these courses and hopefully getting value from them that turns into a stupidly lucrative line of revenue for the business and it was really the thing that took I think we were at about 10k a month in revenue and then when Skillshare started to take off it just jumped up to about 70k a month in revenue almost like within within the period of a few months so I owe lots of Skillshare and I still continue to make classes on Skillshare every few months because it's fun and it's free for people to access because you can just sign up to a free trial so I'll put links down below if you want to check that out I have number 24 is Slack. Slack is our team communication platform probably familiar with it as soon as we started working with the team and hiring people and stuff Slack just became the central source of all of our communication and so I spent a lot of time on Slack and on zoom number 25 is frame.io which is in fact owned by Adobe frame is essentially a tool that you can use to help outsource video editing so again in late 2019 when I first outsource the editing videos for this channel frame would be where the editors would upload the videos and I'd be able to leave comments which was awesome because being able to outsource editing freed up loads of my own time if you want to learn more about outsourcing editing you can sign up to my completely free five day creator printer crash course it's like a five day email thing ill be linked down below if you want to check it out but that gives you some information on how to outsource editing if you're a creator at number 26 is again is a little bit niche and that is convert kit convert kit is an email marketing and automation platform that we switch to I think about a year ago and a bunch of the revenue that flows through the business is ultimately through convert kit and through the power of our email list you're not going to talk about that too much but if you want to learn more about the email side of the equation you can check out my video up there which is about how to start an email newsletter that could potentially change your life and finally at number 27 a little bit niche as well is called Scrivener. Scrivener is an app that is designed for writers it basically is software that lets you write a book in the software and split it up into paragraphs and then contents and basically helps you structure things structure writing in a way that really helps with book writing I've tried Google Docs I've tried pages I've tried word none of them are just nearly as nice and distraction free as Scrivener is for writing a manuscript for a book so again it's kind of a bit niche it's not really relevant to most people but if you're interested in writing a book I'd 100% recommend Scrivener. If you're interested in keeping up to date with my book writing journey you can sign up to my book journey newsletter it's completely free every other week I send an email just updating you about what's going on in the book and sharing some interesting papers and resources and videos that I've seen in my process of doing book research that I'll be linked down below do remember to sign up to Adobe Creative Cloud if you got to this point in the video and you fancy supporting the channel and also leveling up your kind of passion projects or your hobbies or your academics stuff and if you've got onto this point in the video and you like long and rambly videos like this one you might like to check out this video over here which is 28 life lessons that I've learnt in 28 years in approximately 28 minutes so that's a nice little long, long 28 minute video for you to watch if you would like but otherwise thank you so much for watching and I'll see you hopefully in the next video bye bye roll in Hey friends and welcome back to Tech Club the ongoing series where I talk about something something something something this episode is it's all good thank you so much for the tea I was kind do we have that pink mug we're going to tackle them in crawler a little bit and we're going to tackle them in chronological order I need a thing in my hand. Is there anything left in the night cook camp? Yes perfect perfect. Okay. That fine banter. It's continuity. Continuity errors are funny in YouTube videos.
