## Transcript
 Hey friends welcome back to the channel. In this video we are talking about the single most impactful book I have ever read and that is what we owe the future by Moral Philosopher William McCaskel. Now Will is a pretty amazing guy. He is an associate professor of philosophy at the University of Oxford and he helped create the effective altruism movement which is all about using reason and evidence to find the best ways that we can help other people. Now Will's ideas have already had a big impact in my life because in 2019 I took the giving what we can pledge which is a pledge to donate 10% of my income every year to cost effective charity. But this video is about his new book, what we owe the future which is absolutely fantastic and it has already changed the way that I approach what it means to live a good life. And its core argument is that we should be concerned about people who live in the future and that we should take their interests seriously. And that's why we're talking about this book on this episode of Book Club, the ongoing series where we distill and discuss highlights and summaries from some of my favorite books. Anyway in this video we're going to discuss three key points from the book. So firstly the idea that the future is really big and the people who live in the future matter. Secondly how we right now might be living in one of the most important times in all of human history and thirdly how you and me as individuals can actually do something crucially that helps ensure that the future goes well. Point number one the future is big like really big and future people matter. Okay so firstly how big is the future really? Well homo sapiens the human race the human species has been around for around 300,000 years but we only started agriculture about 10,000 years ago so that's really when things start to really take off. And the life of a typical mammalian species is about a million years. So even if humans are just the average mammalian species we are around for another 700,000 years which is absolutely huge in comparison to our past but also we are not just a typical mammalian species. We have the capacity for reason and thought and insight in building cool stuff so if the future goes well we could be around for many millions if not billions of years more than the traditional plastic mammalian species. That means that in the grand scheme of things we are probably in the first 1% of people in the human species and the other 99% of people have yet to be born. So that's pretty cool I hadn't quite appreciated that before or even given it a second thought but the reason we should care about that is that we should care about the lives of these future people, these future people matter. Now this might seem somewhat counterintuitive and really the first time that I fully appreciated what was going on here is when I had a chat with Will on my podcast and here is what he had to say. So when we look to the future and the potential scale of civilization, it's truly immense. Yeah and why does this matter? Well the Manuscus future people matter. If I could think about you know harms and benefits I could prevent or bestow on people the lives of day and then I think oh I could also cause harms and benefits to people 100 or 1000 years time. It's just the distance in time just doesn't really seem to matter in the same way the distance in space doesn't matter. So what do you mean by doesn't matter? Well suppose I tell you you can prevent a genocide a million people will die and now I say oh but it'll happen in 100 years time or it'll happen in 1000 years time or 2000 years time or 2000 years time but the same number of people for sure and let's just assume for sure will be saved are you like oh well 2000 years doesn't now cares about that like I don't think so I think it's like a matter of common sense there. The mere fact that someone will exist at a later date in time doesn't change their model status they have just the same level of model worth. And so putting these ideas together and we'll make just a really compelling and clear argument for it using loads of evidence and numbers and researchers in research and statistics if that's a sort of thing you care about but putting this all together that means that a we really should care about the lives of people born in the future and b because 99% of the human population is not yet been born the actions that we take right now could well impact their lives for the better or for the worse which brings us on to point number two in the book point number two we might be living at one of the most important times in all of human history. Let's start with this timeline from 300,000 years ago when homo sapiens first began to exist to the interesting stuff that's happening now and now have a look at this graph that shows the total output of the world economy and something clearly happened at this point. That thing unsurprisingly was the industrial revolution where all of a sudden in the last 250 or so years we have made unprecedented leaps and bounds and progress in all of the things basically including crucially especially in the last 50 to 60 years the capacity that we have to destroy ourselves. Nuclear weapons were had unprecedented you know the atomic bomb had about 1,000 times the disruptive power of conventional weapons the hydrogen bomb had about 1,000 times the greater disruptive power than the atomic weapons that's just like the beginning of like a new era of disruptive power. I think most scary of all is engineered pandemics, engineered pathogens. Pandemics could get much worse again if they're with viruses that have been deliberately engineered to be disruptive so you could imagine a virus that has the fatality of a builder, the infectiousness of measles. Well now you've got something that like especially if deliberately targeted to do so could kill very large proportion of the world's population. And then in the worst case scenario is literally everyone. We're also advancing faster and faster to make new technologies so things like biotechnologies and bio weapons and artificial intelligence. All of these were at a point where things are evolving so rapidly that if these things are misused or not developed correctly they actually could cause really really bad problems for the human race for individuals of societies, for countries for continents and potentially even cause extinction of the human race which I know it sounds really weird when I did the conversation with well I was just mind-blown that this was actually a thing that people are worried about but genuinely people are worried about the things especially since World War II where now we have the capacity to destroy ourselves which we never did in the past. Essentially all it takes is for one random person one person who has is trained in biology or in a biochemical lab or something and who is a little bit weird like we've seen in America what people do when they're a little bit unhinged school shootings and all that imagine if someone like that had access to the capability to genetically engineer a bio weapon that would be pretty scary and again it seems somewhat science fiction but if you imagine how many weird people there are in the world even if 0.001% of the world's population is a little bit unhinged and if technology is increasing at a rate that makes it a lot easier for people to develop bio weapons that means that we're sitting on a real big problem on our hands that genuinely could change the course of human civilization if we don't do something about it. That's just one of the scary example. He talks about a bunch more in this and there's another great book by Toby Ordcord of the precipice that talks about other risks to humanity including some super interesting and scary stuff around moral value lock-in which is too much to go into in this particular video but he talks about it in the book and you can learn more about it in the podcast interview that I did with Will that's linked down below if you want to check it out. But the nice thing about this book and why it's been kind of praised by so many people is that this is not a doom and gloom type of thing it's not like oh my god guys end of the world tin foil hats like uh just just like conquer up and get some tin debeens instead it's a surprisingly cheerful and optimistic book that talks about crucially what we can do about all of these problems. Keypoint number three you as an individual can actually do something to help ensure that the future goes well and kind of the metaphor here is that if you're setting off on a bit of a risky journey you don't really know what the terrain's gonna look like if you're on a bit expedition and uncharted territory. You kind of don't know what the territory is gonna look like you don't know what the potential risks might be but you can prepare yourself for those risks you would make sure you wear the right kind of cocoa thing you've got the right kind of mat you've got your water purification tablets you've done the things that you can to make sure that even though the future is uncertain you could potentially be better prepared for it. So what are the things that we can do right now given that a the future is important people in the future matter we're living at a ridiculously important time in human history and we want to make a different to their lives what are tangibly practically actionably the things that we can do to actually make a difference. Well the first one as he talks about in the book is actually figuring out what to do with your career in a way that can have maximum impact. Now there's a bunch of fields like artificial intelligence for example you know one of the big risks to humanity is that AI is evolving so fast that at some point and most experts put it at like you know somewhere between 10 and 50 percent in the next 50 to 100 years there is a risk that artificial intelligence could eclipse human intelligence and then we don't know what's gonna happen there yes there's like a doomsday scenario of machines taking over the world but like there's also loads of other bad things that AI could potentially lead to and crucially as of 2020 there were about 40,000 people in the world working to make AI more powerful and there's countries you know US and Russia and China or having this almost AI arms race to try and make artificial intelligence more and more and more powerful but as of 2020 there were only around 300 people in the world actually researching how do we make AI safer and given that the risks of artificial general intelligence are potentially catastrophic to the human race if we don't do something about it the fact that there are so few people comparatively in the field of AI research means that if for example you're a computer scientist or an engineer or software developer or a mathematician and you're looking for something impactful to do with your career shifting your career in the direction of hey if I can be one of the people to help reduce the likelihood that AI is gonna completely destroy us that would be a huge impact those sorts of career changes, career trajectories and figuring out what to do with your career could really make an enormous difference similarly let's look at pandemic prevention if for example you are a doctor yes you could have lots of impact by saving one life at a time and that's all well good but you can have a potentially ridiculously large impact by getting involved in the field of pandemic prevention and doing research around that kind of stuff now in the book he talks about a bunch of more things but he refers us over to 80,000 hours which is an organization that will make us go actually co-founded I've interviewed the other co-founder of it and if you're the people who are like they're based just down the road here in London and the whole point of that organization it's a non-profit all of this stuff is free the whole point is that it helps people like us figure out what careers that we can have to maximize our useful impact and the amount of help that we can be to the world while also making sure we're having fun and being fulfilled in our career and all that kind of stuff then on sponsoring this video or anything I just think that organization is sick so you can check out output links down below to all of their free resources so that if you are thinking of potentially orienting your career towards impact you can definitely find up more 80,000 hours also they've got a newsletter where twice a month they send out details about impactful careers and new research on the topic and they've got completely free one-on-one career consulting type service where they're literally hopping a call with you completely for free again it's not sponsored video I'm not being paid to say this but completely completely for free they'll hop on a call with you and help you figure out what to do with your career which is sick I've had one of these calls it's fantastic and it's free because it's a non-profit and it's funded by other kind of effective altruism open philanthropy funds like that where the aim is to help people actually shift their careers to do more good with them potentially even for the long-term future and it's called 80,000 hours by the way because of 40 hour workweek times 50 weeks a year times 40 years of a traditional career equals 80,000 hours which is the amount of hours you're spending in your career and so spending those hours doing something that can genuinely change the course of the future could potentially be a very impactful way to spend your time but I was gonna do well you can read the book you can listen to my podcast you can check out more of will stuff you can help spread these ideas which is kind of what I'm trying to do here if I can help more people get interested in this sort of thing and recognize hey this long-term stuff is actually super important then that means that I'm having more of an impact through things silly things like this YouTube channel which is awesome you can also donate your money to more effective causes so for example you can take the giving what we count pledge 10% of your income every year I do it loads of other people do it you can join in that below but let's just have a look at the difference in funding between counter terrorism and pandemic prevention this graph shows how many people were killed by pandemics in the last 10 years compared to how many people were killed by terrorists in the last 10 years and this graph shows how much funding pandemic prevention has compared to the amount of funding that counter terrorism has and it's just kind of stuff like that where there are things that can really genuinely impact the present day and also the long-term future that are just so underfunded you know AI safety is underfunded pandemic prevention is underfunded there's a bunch more stuff that he talks about in the book and that 80,000 hours talks about that are completely underfunded and he can check out a charity evaluate or call to give well again non-profit and their job is to analyze the cost effectiveness of different charities so that you can donate your money to funds or charities that are aimed at trying to do the best good possible whether it's in the present day or over the long-term so all this stuff is super interesting if any of the ideas in here vibe with you you should definitely check out the book it's actually sick what we owe the future it's very readable it's very just has completely changed the way I see the world and see the problems in the world and just I've never before appreciated like I feel like my brain has had a software level up by virtue of reading this book so you should definitely check it out linked down below and if you enjoyed this video you might like to check out the full three at our long conversation I had with Wilma Cascill on my podcast that will be linked right over here when we talk about this stuff in way more detail along with a bunch of other stuff like what it's like being a philosophy professor and a load of productivity hacks if you're into that kind of thing anyway check that out over here thank you so much for watching and I'll see you hopefully in the next video
