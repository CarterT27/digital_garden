## Transcript
 Hey guys, welcome back to the channel. If you're new here, my name is Ali. I'm a final year medical student at Cambridge University and this is the fourth installment in the monthly favorite series where each month I talk about the favorite things that I've discovered that month so like books articles, podcasts, that sort of stuff. Before we get started, just a very quick life update. I found out a couple of days ago that I passed my final year exams so I'm pretty much officially a doctor. I submitted my provisional registration to the general medical council so pending some calamity chances are I'm gonna be starting working as a doctor in Cambridge from the 23rd of July onwards so that's pretty exciting. I can't wait to vlog that as we go along kind of life for the junior doctor but anyway, without further ado, let's get started with this month's favorites from April 2018 and let's roll the intro Alright, so this video is gonna be a little bit shorter than the previous ones in the series. I reckon because I think I have less to talk about this month just because we've had exams and I haven't really acquired new things to kind of talk about as my favorite things but first of all, I'm gonna talk about review which is an email news letter service that I've started using. I started using it about five weeks ago to set up a weekly email newsletter brief plug. You can check out the previous issues of my weekly email newsletter that I send out every Sunday morning so I'm gonna talk about that service for a bit. Secondly, I want to talk about a pair of videos by CGP Great about death that helps me reimagine my relationship with death. Thirdly, I'm gonna briefly mention Avengers Infinity War and fourth thing I'm gonna talk about the beauty of having an Amazon Kindle to read books on as one of my favorite things for this month. So let's talk about point number one. Okay, so review is an email news letter service. It basically lets you gather up a mailing list and send emails to that mailing list however frequently you want. It's good because it kind of gets out of the way and lets you folks just on the writing. I've used loads of other email news letter services over the years through running six med and kind of trying to do email marketing and stuff like mail, chimp and things like that. And the thing I really like about review is that it's very suited to kind of a personal news letter format. It's very easy to put links into your email and it forms a little profile page for you that has all your previous issues and it kind of forces you to stick to their design which is nice because then I don't have to personally worry about what if my email newsletter's design is not like good enough and or I consider myself a bit of a web designer wouldn't be a shame if I had like a badly designed news like all of that kind of stuff. It just kind of abstracts all of that away so you as the writer sending the newsletter can just focus on the writing. So firstly I want to mention that to plug my email newsletter to say if you go on email.io.com you can read all the previous issues of this newsletter and if you like the kind of style of the writing and what I talk about you might like to subscribe. I send the email out every Sunday morning slash afternoon and people seem to be enjoying it and I get very nice responses and I try and reply back to everything that I can. But more importantly I wanted to mention it because I think there is a wider lesson that we can all kind of apply from this and it sort of relates to habit building. So for quite a while I've had like a personal blog on my website and I write a post on it maybe once every few months at best and I've yet to get into the habit of like consistently writing and consistency is the key to any form of success in almost any sphere imaginable. So having this week in newsletter that I know I have to write each week that I know like you know at the moment like 650 people which is a stupidly ridiculous number to people that actually care about what I'm writing in an email. But like knowing that each week that I'm going to be sending an email to 650 people makes me very motivated and incentivized to actually write this email every week and then if I'm writing an email every week I want it to be good because obviously it's got my name on it I don't want to deliver bad content to people therefore I've researched more it kind of gets me more into the habit of actually doing the writing and also kind of as I'm going through my week it makes me a bit more introspective about the stuff that I read the thoughts in my head well I discover because I think I'm thinking huh I wonder if this topic I can research a bit more and kind of put it into a newsletter with a few interesting things. So my point is that having this audience to like that holds you accountable to doing something that you want to do anyway I eat kind of improve my writing. Having the audience that holds me accountable to that is really good and I think this is going to apply to pretty much anything. If you have someone or a group of people or group of friends family teachers whoever holding you to account for something that you want to be doing. I think that's a really good way of building the habit and kind of hacking our own brains into wanting to do these things that otherwise would take quite a lot of effort like writing you know a thousand words each week or or anything like that. So yeah I just wanted to mention that briefly firstly to plug my email newsletter you can check it out and secondly as a wider thing that if you can find something that gives you that accountability you know tell your friends tell your family make them hold you accountable that's a really good way of building building good habits. Secondly I want to talk about two videos that I saw by CGP Gray. If you haven't come across him I think it's a him. CGP Gray is a YouTube channel and he does like explain your videos and a lot of interesting topics. Nowadays they're very very thought-provoking videos with like really well done animations and a really interesting story and a very good way of just kind of learning a lot about a lot of interesting things and the videos that I I came across a couple weeks ago related to death. So there was this one about the Dragon Fable which is really good and then another one about what death is and whether death is a good thing. Now in the past I'd always thought yeah obviously death is a good thing because without death you know what's almost what's the point you know death is needed to kind of control the population. If we all live forever we don't get bored if we all live forever then no then almost nothing we do would have have any significance and I think it's I read in some random philosophy book that with that it's only the transience of life that actually gives life meaning or something along those lines and I'd always just kind of believe that. But then after watching these videos and seeing CGP Gray's take on it that genuinely made me change my mind about death and I know no longer the thing that death is a required part of life and kind of a few videos that I watched subsequently that I think everything in the description below if you want to check them out about kind of life prolonging treatments that we've now discovered and new research in the area of longevity. Maybe really appreciate the importance of maximizing our own time in good health and that made me pay much more attention to exercise into my posture and to kind of stretching and to eating well and all all of the stuff that's genuine that's like objectively good but that I'd never really paid any attention to before and kind of getting this perspective about death as death being like this curable evil rather than this inevitable thing that we will resign ourselves and that we tell stories to ourselves that it's actually good thing. Having that perspective has given me more of a kind of solidified perspective on things like good health so I've been experimenting a little bit with veganism it's not really worked so far but a few of you have very kindly sent me links via Instagram and stuff I mentioned this on the email newsletter again you can subscribe to the email newsletter if you like so I just wanted to mention that highly recommend you check out the CDP Graze YouTube channel and if you're interested in death or even if you're not you might want to check out these videos it might give you an interesting perspective. Thirdly very brief mention Avengers Infinity War incredible film absolutely loved it. I just love anything Marvel in general like when I see that Marvel logo and the you know they're coming back and forth I just know it's going to be a good film and I have a very low kind of threshold for enjoying a Marvel film or any kind of superhero film in general like people say that like Batman versus Superman was bad I know it's not Marvel but I actually quite enjoyed it I think it's pretty solid and I just have this love of superhero films and I wanted to mention that as one of my favorite things I'm not really quite sure what the if there is a broad general broad meaning to this the probably isn't really I just love superhero films I love romantic films as well superhero films and romantic films are like the best genres in my opinion if they can combine the two together then oh that is the absolute dream combination but yeah Marvel's and Marvel's Avengers Infinity War really really good film absolutely can't wait for the next one yeah and finally I want to talk about the Kindle I'm gonna grab mine this this is a Kindle the Kindle has done more to improve my own like reading and my like appreciation of the world than anything else in life I reckon and the reason I was thinking about this was I was thinking about what what I was going to say in this week's video and I was thinking that oh actually I I really haven't come across much new stuff last month because I was revising for exams and all of this stuff and I realised that the reason I haven't come across that much new stuff is because I have left my Kindle at my family home in some albums for about for about two months and normally what I do like my bedtime routine is that I get into bed around like 11 or 12 or whenever and I turn all the lights off and I use the Kindle paper white turned the brightness all the way down but still there's a little bit of backlight coming from it and it means I can kind of read with all the lights closed and I just kind of read read something until the point where I feel myself getting really tired and then I just chuck it onto the floor chuck my glasses onto the floor and just fall asleep and I've noticed for the last like two months when I haven't had the Kindle I felt that falling asleep was a huge waste of time because I'd kind of be lying in bed for half an hour and just thinking random stuff and I have this thing that I always want to be productive and I don't want to be kind of wasting any time just thinking about random stuff but since having the Kindle back I've been able to sleep much better because now I can read just you know to the point until my eyes start to close and now I have new stuff to read and you know expand my horizons and the Kindle has a really nice feature where you can like highlight it and then you can revisit your highlights and it's a good way of taking more from a book than just kind of reading it once but yeah the Kindle has one of my favorite things ever it has changed my relationship with life because it's let me get instant access to pretty much any book I can think of within about five seconds of hearing about it and you know that when like a friend recommends a book to you you can just literally buy on Amazon sent it to Kindle there and then and you know that you will read it at some point within the next week that's a really good thing so Kindle is the fourth on my April favorites even though obviously I've been using a Kindle for absolutely years but you know there's no reason why these videos can't have things that I like outside of you know things I just cover that month but yeah just wanted to say that okay so that brings us to the end of the video thank you very much for watching I hope you found this useful as you might be able to tell I was struggling a little bit for things to say but I think another point I made right at the start it's all about consistency I've made a commitment to myself and to everyone else really that I'm going to be doing these videos each month and so I'm going to be doing these videos each month whether or not I have something to talk about and it forces me to find something to talk about to think a little bit harder about the day-to-day life and the things I enjoy and whether I'm actually getting any value out of them and whether other people might get value out of them so yeah thank you for watching the next few videos and here are going to be more vlogs more study with me things and we'll do some travel vlogs as well and I think I might at some point do like a 20 case of subscribers Q&A a lot of you have sent in questions via Instagram already if you have any questions for the Q&A just like person down below or sent me a DM on Instagram or email me alia aliabelle.com or like whatever social media channel you want to message me on a few asks if you want you can subscribe to my email newsletter I send the email out each week on Sundays usually that have something very vaguely interesting and then you can have a look at the previous issues at email.aliabelle.com and see if it's a kind of thing you might like you know reading I've also started tweeting more so anytime I come across something interesting I just kind of tweet it and therefore like I know a lot of you are kind of seem sort of seem to be sending messages interested in kind of my favorite books or interesting things I discover that or all of that kind of stuff I'll be tweeting interesting links from my Twitter and I've also recently set up a Facebook page you know one of those Facebook fan pages because I'm I feel like a proper narcissist having one of these Facebook fan pages but yeah if if you like my stuff please consider liking the Facebook page I'm going to be posting some like videos and maybe some live stuff on there and maybe like if we do ever do like a in real life meet and greet then I think Facebook would be the most legit platform to organise that on so yeah I know a lot of us still have exams left I feel for you minor or finished no more exams for a little the next like two years so all the best with your revision if you still got exams if you like this video please give it a thumbs up if you haven't subscribed to the channel please consider doing so have a lovely day good luck with your revision I'll see you in the next video bye bye
