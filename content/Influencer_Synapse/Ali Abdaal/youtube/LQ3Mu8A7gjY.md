 What will I do without you so now? Drawing me and then kicking me out. Got my head that's been in no kidding. I can't even look down. What's going on in that beautiful mind? I'm a no magical mystery ride. And I'm so dizzy to know what hit me, And I'm the art of it. And I'm the world of it. I'm breathing fine. You're crazy and I'm out of my mind. Because all of me love all of you. Love your eyes and all your redges. All your perfect imperfections. Give your all to me. I'll give my all to you. And you're my end and my weekend. Even when I lose you when and I give you all. You give me all of you.
