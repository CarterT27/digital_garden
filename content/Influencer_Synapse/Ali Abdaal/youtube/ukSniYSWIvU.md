## Transcript
 Hey guys, welcome back to the channel. If you're new here, my name is Ali. I'm a junior doctor working in Cambridge and in this video I'm gonna be unboxing this new 2018 15 inch MacBook Pro I'll be getting it set up and then I'm gonna do a quick whistle stop tour through all of the different apps that I use on a daily basis for things like productivity Making notes absolutely used to use as a student But also stuff that I used to make videos and to make my life a little bit more efficient and more productive whenever I'm on my computer As always times times to everything that I'm gonna talk about I'm gonna be linked in the video description So if you don't like on box things or if you want to see a particular app You can just find it in the description and click to that timestamp, but now let's just jump into it Let's unbox this thing and get it set up. I'm very excited Oh, yes, look at that So shiny isn't it? Oh my god, it's a unbox this bad boy Oh wow, this thing is huge Look at that apparently I'm unboxing just supposed to show what's in the box So here's a cable USB-C cable designed by Apple in California Think it is the charging gizmo. Yeah, it's pretty much it Okay, so I've got this laptop set up now. I'm now in the process of downloading a lot of these apps So let's get started with what I think is the most important app for my personal productivity and that is Alfred Alfred acts as a spotlight replacement which means that when you press command and space bar You get the little search box that comes up and then you can type anything into that so you can search google You can search files you can you can open any app and it's just a lot more efficient than using using the trackpad and kind of clicking on the thing Clicking on the dock and then opening opening the icon my theory when it comes to being productive when a computer is that a it's about kind of on a broad perspective Doing the right things, but secondly, it's also about being quick at operating the computer itself So for example, let's say I want to open a file I know what file I want to open but I want to minimize the amount of time it takes for that file to get open If I had to do the trip the whole using the mouse thing I'd have to click on the dark click and find to have find it through my folders and it will take about 10 seconds of my life And when this process gets repeated, I didn't finish them because I spent hours and hours of it Computer every day it just ends up wasting a lot of time and then we die with regrets But when you're using something like Alfred if you know the name of the file you can just do command space bar And then type the name of the file and it opens up and within about one second You've got this file open up that you want so you reduce this kind of lap time So that's why I use Alfred number two I really like moom which is a utility that lets you snap windows to the side windows I've had this feature for ages but for some reason max don't have it natively So you do need a third party app for that you can use a keyboard shortcut like command shift m Which is what I use and then you can just type in left or right and then that snaps the window to either side of the screen I also really like the app bartender bartender just kind of cleans up those icons that you get in the corner And because I fancy myself a bit of a minimalist. I like that list of icons being minimal, you know So it only shows the most important thing So for example my battery and Wi-Fi whereas all the other things like google driver do be created cloud All the other kind of apps that stay open but just have the icons they get hidden behind these three dots Which look quite classy so Alfred movement bartender will probably the utilities that I use most often In terms of apps that I use for creating stuff I do use the Adobe Creative Cloud. I've got the monthly subscription that gives me everything Back when I was a student this was quite cheap. It's now become a lot more expensive So I need to probably reconsider how much I'm spending on this sort of stuff But the apps I use every day almost every day are firstly Lightroom Which I use for editing all my Instagram photos and everything for Facebook I use Photoshop quite a lot to make like graphics and things for for my websites I use Adobe Audition to occasionally do some audio editing for these videos and it very occasionally I use After Effects. I'm not an expert using After Effects, but I do like downloading templates for it And modifying them so for example for my medical Monday's intro Anyway, so those are the four Adobe Creative Cloud apps that I use most often In terms of video editing I use Final Cut Pro and in terms of Music editing for my what when I do songs or covers of songs or like guitar or piano parts I use Logic Pro for that and the nice thing about this is that with the Apple education bundle for about 200 pounds It's still quite a lot of money. You can get Final Cut Pro and Logic Pro and compressor and motion And these are the Apple apps and you get them all for 200 pounds in total And this makes it much much more affordable rather than the monthly fee that you have to pay to use the Adobe products Anyway moving on obviously I use Spotify to listen to music. I tried using Apple music Don't really like it even though I'm an Apple fanboy and almost every other regard I think Spotify does have a superior product that to do this to app I like to use is called things Yes, this is again expensive Expensive is all relative. I have zero calms about paying for software especially software that I use daily Especially software that saves me time and I'm really full and in love with things and they're getting things done Kind of approach to productivity And efficiency. There's a few books on that that I'll link in the description below So things is basically a very nicely designed to do list that lets you pretty much add anything to it You've got an inbox. You've got like a some day list. You've got a today list and you've got all these different areas of your life that you can Organize so for example my YouTube videos is one area of my life my kind of medical work is another area So you can categorize things very nicely using things so that's the to-do list app that I like to use the app that I use for making notes It's called bear now. I used to use evinote fabs at the ages, but then I switched to bear a couple of years ago because It's like evinote started to get very bloated and very slow Then I switched to bear which is a much more simple writing experience and the nice thing about bear is that you can write in markdown Markdown is just like a very easy way of formatting text that gives you headings and bold and italics So if I'm writing my weekly emails which you can subscribe to in this link down below or if I'm writing a blog post My blog is hosted on ghost and ghost lets you write in markdown So all I have to do is write something in bear and then I just copy and paste it as a markdown into ghost and then it appears nicely formatted on my website So that's what I use bear for and I also use bear to track my uh workouts every time I go to the gym I just have a single note and I just add stuff to it as I go along because you know as they say what gets measured gets managed Another thing that I find really improves my productivity just in general is WhatsApp web But this is like the web client for WhatsApp which surprisingly so many people don't know it even exists So I'm in a lot of WhatsApp groups as I'm sure a lot of people are and I took a lot of my friends through WhatsApp But I always find it annoying having to go on my phone and type with a little keyboard and it's just so inefficient compared to typing on a computer So WhatsApp have released a Mac client You just download it you scan a QR code with your phone and then you log into WhatsApp and then you get WhatsApp messages through your MacBook That sort of thing so WhatsApp went pretty really good And finally and I probably should have mentioned this much earlier the password manager that I use is one password I think it's really good. Yes again a cost money, but for me and for a lot of people who are who have their lives on on the cloud and in in their Google Google account or whatever if your accounts get compromised that would be an absolute catastrophe So one password just basically makes it really easy like it automatically generates secure passwords for all your different websites And in order to access them you have to just log in with your one password So you log into one password the app with your one password and then it automatically fills in your You know secure passwords for all these different websites and there's got loads of like security stuff behind it And if you can you can read more about that if you want but pretty much everyone these days recommends using a password manager There's also last pass and a few others, but one password is the ones that I started using and I've never really found any reason to stop So that was a very quick whistle stop tour through all of the apps that I use on a daily basis I hope that was vaguely interesting I've never really done much kind of the of these tech videos, but I do want to make it more of a thing I really enjoy tech and my tech enthusiast and I quite like making these sorts of videos So I hope it's useful if there's anything in particular that you want me to do a more deeper dive into then by all means Let me know in the comments and I'll add it to my list a few videos on planning So I'm definitely planning a really extensive video about how I use Alfred and how it supercharge My productivity so we'll do a video about that and then maybe a few other things related to the iPad and apps I've got on my iPhone. So yeah, I hope that was vaguely interesting I'm very excited to be using this new tech book pro It's huge and it's lovely and it's fully spiked out except the hard drive because that cost like $3,000 extra for the four terabytes. I've got the one terabyte hard drive, but got all the other upgrades So hopefully this should make my own video editing and stuff workflow Much more quick, but thank you very much for watching if you liked the video please give it a thumbs up If you haven't subscribed to the channel yet please consider doing so have a lovely day and I'll see you in the next video. Goodbye
