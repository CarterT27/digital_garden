 Hey guys, welcome back to the channel. This is a very quick video. A public service announcement for anyone who uses an iPad Pro or an iPad and that is to tell you about the launch of the paper like V2 And the paper like is the best screen protector for the iPad hands down and you know, it's called the paper like because it makes it feel like paper when you're drawing on it with the Apple pencil. Now the guys behind the paper like released their V1 like two years ago and I've been using it ever since and I made a video about how it was the best iPad screen protector in the market But they've just launched their Kickstarter campaign for the version two and they very kindly sent me the pre release model of the V2 paper like several weeks ago And I've been testing it out ever since and what was the best iPad screen protector has now just got on a little bit better Because the only real drawback that the paper like V1 had was that if you have like a white background There's a bit more noise in the image than you would expect But what the paper like V2 has done is that it's pretty much gotten rid of the display noise They've done some weird nanoparticle coating thing on it, which still makes it feel like paper when you're writing on it But now the display looks almost as vibrant as you know just a glass screen Like I don't think you can ever fully get rid of this slightly noisy display But now that's so much more marketing reduced than the previous V1 and now when I look at my iPad I'm just kind of flabbergasted the colors that I'm seeing because I'm like, oh this looks so bright and blue and stuff Because I don't have the display noise that I used to with the paper for with the paper like V1 Yeah, everything else about it is the same. If you have an iPad or an iPad Pro and you write with the Apple Pencil on it It's pretty much a no brainer to get the paper like they've sold kind of tens of thousands of units around the world And to artists and students and you know graphics people and web designers and stuff Who all swear by it. I've been using it every single day for the last like two years and now the V2 is even better So if you want to grab it on Kickstarter If you support the Kickstarter project you get like 10 euros off the retail price So I'll put an affiliate link down in the description below So if you buy it through there on Kickstarter I've supported it on Kickstarter If you buy it through Kickstarter then I make enough money for a cup of coffee Then the price goes up to like 35 euros after the campaign is over So I'll make a proper video about this like you know afterwards Like doing a full-on review and explaining things in depth But I just wanted to put this up to let you guys know that if you have an iPad or an iPad Pro Then you should definitely follow the link in the description Go over to Kickstarter and I'll pledge to get the paper like V2 Because it just it takes the formula that worked and just makes it better And when you're spending so much money on iPad and if like me you're spending your life Pretty much on your iPad Like my iPad is pretty much replaced my laptop for all things except like video editing and coding I do everything on my iPad and so having a screen protector that makes the experience Just that little bit nicer is absolutely worth it in my opinion So yeah, thanks for watching I'll put a link to all this stuff in the video in the video description And I'll put this video on unlisted or something When the campaign is over and do a proper full-on review Also sneak peek of this new desk setup Several videos about that are going to be coming soon So hold on to your horses for that Thank you for watching and I'll see you in the next video
