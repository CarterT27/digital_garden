## Transcript
 Hey friends, welcome back to the channel. So from around 2019 through to 2021, I listen to about 500 podcast episodes. And to be honest, other than books probably podcast are the single biggest source of inspiration and ideas and learnings that I've basically ever had in my life. And when I started this YouTube channel in 2017, I knew so little about things like marketing and branding and filming and growing business and any of this sort of stuff. But it was through listening to a bunch of podcasts over the years that I've gotten the knowledge to do that and now this YouTube channel and the business around it is reasonably successful. So for this video, I went back through four years worth of podcast listening history and these are the 20 podcasts that I would say have had a significant impact on my life and on my business in that time. Let's start off with interview-e-type conversational-type podcasts and the number one on this list is the Tim Ferriss Show which I first started listening to. I think around 2016, this is the podcast that I've listened to the most episodes off. And even though I've only listened to a few dozen episodes out of the several hundred, he's got in the back catalogue, I would say that this is probably the single biggest podcast that's most changed my life. And mainly for me, the value of the Tim Ferriss Show has been in hearing Tim Ferriss interviewing people who I might not have otherwise come across. There's a few episodes in particular come to mind. There was one interview that he did with a chat called Derrick Syvers who then I really enjoyed his appearance in the podcast and then I followed all of Derrick's work and read all his blog posts and read his books and I actually reached out to him to do an interview on my own YouTube channel and now he and I at friends and we talk occasionally and it's turned into like this this correlation chip from this guy who I discovered through the Tim Ferriss Show a few years ago I also listened to an episode that Tim Ferriss did with Mr. Money Moustache who is a financial independence and early retirement type and blogger on the internet and I'd never heard of this financial independence movement until I listened to that episode and then I was like oh this is interesting and I went down the rabbit hole of the fire movement financial independent retiree and I discovered Mr. Money Moustache in a bunch of other personal finance bloggers and it was through reading all that stuff a few years ago that it really started to take things like investing and you know budgeting and trying to make one money all of that stuff a bit more seriously and more recently the various episodes that Tim's done on crypto interviewing kind of experts on the world of crypto has helped me go down that rabbit hole as well and so really the reason I recommend the Tim Ferriss Show to everyone is not that you'll get some amazing productivity tips or some business advice or anything like that it's more that it's just a really cool way to discover interesting people and then if you vibe with their ideas that you hear in the podcast then you can choose to follow those rabbit holes next we have the Knowledge Project which is a podcast by Shane Parrish of Pharnam Street and that's also an interview type podcast it is a bit more low key than the Tim Ferriss Show but Shane also has like really cool and interesting guests so in fact the first time I heard of a guy called Navarrovacant was on his episode of The Knowledge Project and that episode was just packed with so much value and I remember the feeling of listening to it and just my mind being blown like 24-7 not too far from them for the three hours while I was listening to it and then obviously I discovered Navarrovacant and kind of went on a rabbit hole exploring his tweets exploring his spot his own podcast even buying his book that came out while not his book a book that came out recently called The Almanac of Navarrovacant which is very good and has like a distillation of his life wisdom there was also a good episode of The Knowledge Project where he interviewed Esther Perrell who is a relationships expert who writes a lot about this and does relationships counseling and that again was an incredible mind blowing episode that then introduced me to the work of Esther Perrell so again the way I see these interview podcasts it's not like hey every single podcast I'm taking insights away from it although that is true in fairness I forgot to most of them because I don't really have a good process for taking notes and revisiting them but it's more like oh wow I really enjoyed the interview with that person therefore I'm going to explore that content a little bit more next on the list we have deviate by Rolf Pots now Rolf Pots is a chap who wrote a book called Vagabonding which I also discovered through Tim Ferriss and what Rolf did was that he spent I think 20 years ago he'd see his he spent a some large amount of time just like traveling around the world with himself and a suitcase and writing about that experience of kind of being a Vagabond and he did this way before this soda traveling stuff was cool so I read the book because Tim Ferriss had an impact on him so I read the book I really liked it and then when Rolf Pots started his own podcast I started listening to that and now this is a bit less in the way of like business advice and stuff but it's more like a generally interesting life type podcast because he tends to interview people who are also into the whole traveling thing one of the real values I get from things like that is that you've probably heard that thing that you are the average of the people the five people closest to you and the sort of people that you have around you do tend to define your kind of box like you know your box of possibilities in life and so if you're friends with a bunch of people or you know your friends or friends with a bunch of people who are all doctors chances are you're going to think oh this medicine thing is pretty cool equally if you start to become friends with people who are tech founders or youtubers suddenly starting a startup or starting a youtube channel is going to seem like a totally normal thing to do and you're more likely to do it and I think the value of podcasts like this is in the fact that it exposes youtube people that you might not have come across before and so I'd never really seriously considered the idea of long-term traveling because it just it was outside my box of possibilities but then when I started listening more to Rolf Pots and the people he interviews it now it then became more of a thing and sort of expanded my horizons a bit that oh this is something that people can do and I can do it as well oh and by the way if you want to check out any of these podcasts they're all going to be linked in the video description and also links to all the books that I'm mentioning in this particular video so you can check those out if you like next we have a pretty interesting podcast called Bookworm now Bookworm is not a very mainstreamy podcast Tim Ferriss shame Paris these Royal Family Mainstream but Bookworm is a bit of a bit of a hidden treasure I think and it's these two dudes in America we just talk about books like every week they read a new book or every other week and then they discuss it and so I actually found a bunch of book recommendations through the Bookworm podcast that I might not have come across before this one make time is a book that I discovered through the Bookworm podcast and so I read the book and I really liked it and then I actually made a video about the book and then reached out to the author John Zeratsky who then I had on an old episode of my own podcast and actually now John and I are internet friends so the other day I helped on a zoom call with him where he was giving me advice for how to write my own book and so I discovered this through the Bookworm podcast and there have been a bunch of books where I've been thinking oh I don't know if I should read this book and then hearing these two guys in the Bookworm podcast discuss the book has either made me decide to read it or decide to not read it and either way it's been a way of saving time and just listening to an interesting conversation about interesting stuff like books next on the list we have not overthinking and not overthinking is actually the weekly podcast that I do with my brother this has been going on for the last three years if you didn't know it was a thing it's a thing we have a YouTube channel we do video podcasts as well and here I just talk about you know life and happiness and anything in between that's on our minds and so when I was going through my podcast history I found that I've really listened to episodes of not everything thinking about like some of but around about 15 times just because it's kind of interesting and it's now particularly interesting looking at the back hat a look like you know three years ago what's a sort of stuff me and my brother were thinking about again links to that in the video description if you want to check it out there's a few more interview podcasts that I listened to sporadically there's one called Invest Like The Best which is very good there's the North Star podcast for David Parail there's the art of manliness podcast there's impact theory and the school of greatness those are some of the standard ones that I will dabble with occasionally if they seem to have a good guest on and recently I've started listening to the diary of a CEO as well which is a podcast by Stephen Bartlett that I was actually interviewed on about as as a productivity expert so you can check that out if you like and in fact if I can plug another one of my things like the diary of a CEO was kind of the model that we used to start my own podcast recently a few months ago called Deep Dive with Ali Abdullah again we have a YouTube channel for that it'll be linked down below and it's also available on all the podcast platforms and every week we have basically a long form interview like me having a conversation with someone else and so I've interviewed a bunch of authors and creators and entrepreneurs and other cool people and we just talk about how they find fulfillment in work and in life so you can check that out if you like this was kind of the combination of me having listened to these sorts of interview podcasts for the last five years and deciding you know what this actually seems like a cool way to connect with people I want to do one of these things myself all right let's move on to the category of health now sadly I only listened to one health podcast and that is the human lab as a podcast after I listening to fairly recently when I decided hey I was going to take more care of my health and even my lab podcast is amazing it's by the guy called Andrew Heberman who is a professor of neuro biology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine and each episode he doesn't deep dive into a specific part of what the what the science says about how we can live kind of healthier better lives and so one episode in particular there's really had an impact on me is this episode all about optimizing sleep and he goes through the evidence in about three hours and he taught you brings in a bunch of studies and he turns it into this actionable advice that you can do right now to just automatically level up your sleep and so now I've started following some of his recommendations and we're working on a video about that as we speak next we have the category of business podcasts and these are probably the ones that have most contributed to kind of the business success of this YouTube channel and the business around it because these are more focused on things like marketing and operations and growth and that kind of stuff the first one of the list is the my first million podcast which I've listened to a few dozen episodes of and started listening to I think when it first came out and the premise of my first million is that these two guys Sean and Sam were interviewing people about how they made their first million dollars which is this like super interesting and so for the first like several dozen episodes they were interviewing these cool people and kind of riffing on business ideas with them and trying to understand how they started these like interesting businesses that ended up getting $2 million. These days the focus of the podcast has changed a bit it's now more about Sam and Sean sort of kind of breaking down other creators who've done really well or businesses or just riffing on business ideas by themselves and to be honest one of the main things I've taken away from this is just the general meta idea that making money on the internet through businesses is actually not that hard there are loads of people doing it and there are loads of models for it and no you don't have to make a YouTube channel where you have your face on camera kind of giving advice there are zillions of business models that you can do and just hearing how other people have done it has hit I've always found really helpful in just sparking ideas in my own head to like oh if I wasn't doing this YouTube channel thing and this wasn't going well I could do this or that or this or that and the more of these podcasts I listen to the more confidence I get that even if this whole YouTube channel goes to part in everything dies I could probably start again completely from scratch and just build another business and it would be super fun and I enjoy the journey and it could probably be reasonably successful after some time as well and the way thing is that like I speak to a bunch of people who want to start businesses like you know this friends of mine this is like colleagues when I was working a doctor and also when I when I used to do fan meetups you will be like oh I already want to start this business and I'd be like oh what podcast do you listen to and there would be like oh I don't really listen to podcasts but okay what you know what books have you read about business oh yeah I don't really read okay there's just it just completely baffles me I still like there is so much knowledge out there in terms of how to build and grow a business you know there's like so many books so many audiobooks they're basically free they're very cheap and you know I'm sure you can find ways to get them for free if you have so you need to podcast podcasts everywhere are completely free the amount of knowledge you can get from podcasts from other people who have built million dollar plus businesses riffing on business ideas it's just absolutely astronomical and so over the last few years I've really been shoving podcasts and audiobooks and books down the throats of people I've met who are like oh I want to start a business and make money on the internet but I don't know how it's like do listen to podcasts and you will find out how next we have a podcast which is on the same vein as my first million but a little bit less clickbaity it's called indie hackers and that's really interesting because it's interviews with indie developers like individuals who in their own bedrooms or in their own like you know one man band have started internet businesses that have made you know a thousand dollars a month ten k a month hundred k a month a million dollars a month just through again all sorts of different things you know there's people who've like bought and sold the main name is the people who built website builders people who've done like messaging apps like people who've built all sorts of things on the internet and these are interviews where they explain how they did it and what the thought process was and how they came up with the ideas and how they grew and what the feeling is now that they're setting on this you know making five million a year off this one software thing where it's just them and one of their mates just doing it together and I used to listen to this a lot when I was in the software thing because I used to code and build software apps and stuff and it would always give me some really good ideas for businesses that I can do and so again if I lost everything on this youtube channel the way I'd get back to making money again would probably be through coding up some kind of software product and I'd be kind of binging the indie hackers back catalogue for ages to be like okay let me find some ideas in here next we have a pair of podcasts uh Noah Kagan presents and online marketing made easy by Amy Porterfield so Amy and Noah they're both like marketing-y type podcasts and they're both like sometimes do interviews sometimes do solo episodes and I remember so for Noah Kagan I listened to 20 of his episodes and for online marketing made easy I listened to 12 of her episodes around about 2019-20 when I was focused on like oh how do we market this business how do we grow up of course it's all that kind of stuff and that was super useful and then we have the Navarra Vikon podcast this is a really good book the Almanac of Navarra Vikon I mentioned him when I discovered him on the final street podcast he has his own mini podcast where it's not regular thing he just recorded a bunch of episodes expanding on his ideas of how to get rich without getting lucky and it's really good again link in the video description if you want to check out any of these next we have a few podcasts related to being a youtuber and being a creator so number one on that list is the video creators podcast by Chapp called Tim Schmoyer and his team I've listened to 31 of those episodes in the last like 12 of 18 months or so I don't listen to them religiously because they have like lots of varying advice for youtubers but if something catches my fancy I'll just like you know add it to my list and it's very easy listen and I often get useful tips for growing the youtube channel and then we have the Gary V audio experience Gary Vayne Chuck is one of my kind of internet guru idol type people he's not everyone's cup of tea but if you can get over kind of the kind of brash way that he talks the advice that he gives and the way that he's built a billion dollar business with a team of 1500 people while also doing his like just making loads of content on the internet as a side hustle and how he's been doing that for the last like 10 plus years since way before it was cool it's just like super inspiring and Gary is always seems to be at the forefront of what is going on in the world so he was you know encouraging people to get on TikTok way before it was cool he was encouraging people to get on LinkedIn way before people started blowing up on LinkedIn he's been pushing this whole NFT thing and if I actually had listened to more of his podcast episodes in the last sort of 12 months I would have probably jumped on the NFT craze a lot sooner than I actually did and then we have five podcasts of that are run by creators or creator friends so there's that creative life by Serodici there's the Stolen podcast by Tyler Stolenman there's the secret podcast which is Matt Diivello's Patreon exclusive podcast which I've been a patreon patreon patreon of his for the last few years so that's an interesting podcast there's the Matty and Pete show which is Peter McKinnon and Matty Hapoja and there's the Tuxedo time podcast which is Becky and Chris so these are either creators that I'm friends with or actually now all of these guys started off as creators that I admired on the internet and for most of them now I'm actually internet friends with these guys never met any of them in real life but it's gonna happen at some point and so I have their podcast on my subscription feed as well and when an interesting episode comes up I'll listen to it and it's just kind of nice and then we come on to the category of finance now there's two podcasts I want to mention here number one is the property podcast which is run by company called Property Hub which is a very niche specific podcast for property investors in the UK so if you're not a property investor or want to be property investor in the UK you're not gonna get any value out of it but I've had an almost value out of podcast number two on the list which is smart passive income by Pat Flynn I've been listening to this for out of the years it just had so many episodes that have been so helpful and helping me think about how to monetize a creator business like this one and now Pat Flynn and I owned our internet friends and he introduced me to my bookwriting coach who I kind of I mentioned I was struggling with writing a book and he said oh you've got a connect with this guy called Azul and Azul and I are working together and there's all these like serendiped disconnections that happen so many of these have happened because I have listened to someone's podcast and then start following them on Twitter or on YouTube and then kind of they've got to know of me as my channel has gotten bigger and then I've kind of become internet friends with these people which is always a really cool thing and honestly I think this is one of the best parts of being a creator on the internet these days like obviously it's nice having the audience it's nice being able to make videos it's nice being able to make money but really the single best thing about it is probably the friends that you make along the way as corny and cliche as that sounds now if you decide you're into this whole interview thing you should definitely check out my deep dive podcast that is all available down below and we'll put it over here somewhere as well but uh a year before I started this during the pandemic I actually did a but I think a few dozen remote interviews with these sorts of people that I'd mire on the internet and I did those interviews as YouTube livestreams at the time but they're no longer available on the channel instead they are all available on nebula now if you haven't heard nebula is an independent streaming platform that's built by me and a bunch of other creators and on nebula we can put exclusive content like my all-to-deep dive series and videos like my workflow series where I do a deep dive into my favorite productivity tools and it's not trying to be a competitor to YouTube but it's a place where creators can put content without really worrying about the YouTube algorithm like for example I wouldn't upload a two-hour long interview with bestselling author Ryan Holiday to the main channel because it would just would be weird to upload an interview to the main channel instead that is over in nebula now conveniently the best way to get access to nebula is by signing up to curiosity stream who are very kindly sponsoring this video if you haven't heard curiosity stream is the world's leading documentary streaming subscription platform and on curiosity stream they've got thousands of titles that you can choose from high quality high budget documentaries from all sorts of areas like science and technology through to space and architecture and history and food and medicine and nutrition and everything in between and because curiosity stream loves supporting independent creators we actually have a really cool bundle deal with them where if you sign up for curiosity stream which is less than 15 dollars a year you will get free access to nebula bundled with that so for less than 15 dollars a year you get these for access to thousands of high quality documentaries and you also get all of the stuff that I've got exclusively on nebula including the deep dive interview series which mirrors the format of these podcasts that have had an enormous impact on my life over the last five years if that's hand up your straight they just head over to curiositystream.com forward slash alley and if you sign up over there you'll get your nebula details email to
