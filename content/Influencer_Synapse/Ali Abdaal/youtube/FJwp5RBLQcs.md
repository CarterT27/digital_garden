## Transcript
 Hey friends, welcome back to the channel. This is going to be a little bit of a chatty video where I make some tea I'm going to drink some tea and we're going to talk about the goals new life goals for the year Fun times and I'm going to review the life goals that I said last year And we'll see whether I've made any progress on them and then we're going to unveil or talk about my goals But this year and along the way I'll share what's on my bucket list and some of my kind of some of the stuff I've learned around the idea of goals setting over the last 12 months or so. Alright, so let's start by Revealing last year's goals the first one on the list which is interesting was to write an amazing best seller book Which did absolutely not end up going to plan I had this vague idea that you know in January last year I was like you know what a book is 80,000 words. I'm a pretty fast typist if I say to myself Therefore, I should be able to write 2000 words a day and so within 42 days I eat six weeks I should be able to get out the first draft of the book and it should be able to be good And so I was like right by the middle of February 2021 I will have a book first draft it is now January 2022 a whole year later And I still haven't got a book first draft The writing a book has proven to be a lot harder than I originally thought And we spent a bunch of time thrashing back and forth trying to figure out what the key ideas are And being the proposal and getting book deals in various countries now We've got all of that and now I need to write the first draft of the book and so I've given myself well My publisher deadline is July so the middle of this year But I've given myself the deadline of March by March I'll have the first draft and then we'll spend a few months like hopefully time tightening it up Trying to actually make it good because the vibe is that the first draft of the book is always really really crap And you just have to lean into that and make a really crappy first draft The next goal we had was make progress towards finding a wife And I put this into my anti wasteman system which all is the notion template that I linked I'm below quite the way thank you notion for sponsoring this video more than later Anyway, make progress towards finding a wife. Why? Well, because relationships are one of the most important parts of life And it's good to take the seriously moving forward Plus it would be fun and hopefully if I meet the right person my life will be better Although TPH I can't imagine that a lot of all That's what I wrote about a year ago So how did that go? Well, I feel like I have actually made progress towards finding a wife Like setting that as a sort of one of my active goals I was working on for last year Did genuinely make me take dating more seriously It was a bit of a shame about lockdown But I've actually gone a few dates and I actually actually met someone who I'm feeling pretty good about So more on that in a later video We'll keep this one fairly PG for now. Am I right? Go on number three was six pack abs Why because it's a fun challenge would potentially help the wife quest Never had abs before so it's a novelty and would encourage healthy behaviors ish And I had reason to that by December 2021 I'll have had a period of at least two weeks where my abs are showing I need to convert into a body fat percentage This did not end up working out I guess I sort of tried to try I don't really try properly I would just like oh, I'll kind of vaguely give it a go I did get a personal trainer which really helped And I did start kind of counting my macros and doing that kind of stuff But I realized pretty quickly into the year that I don't really care massively about the goal I think this is one of the things where if you are working on a goal that has that requires lots of time effort and some level of sacrifice It's actually quite hard to consistently motivate yourself to work towards it If you fundamentally don't actually care about the goal at the end of it So the reason I wanted six pack abs was sort of just for the bans And it really have a compelling reason other than this vague idea That oh maybe it'll make me more attractive So yeah that did not happen Maybe it's the thing that I might actually go for this year But we'll see right so go on number four was to busk on the London Underground Would be cool it's been on my bucket list for ages now And I said that by December I'll have had my busking license for the London Underground And I'll have filmed myself busking at least once Ended up not happening I actually did reach out to a friend Mary Spender who is a musician and a youtuber And convicted description if you want to check her out And someone emailed me who saw that on my bucket list And said that apparently the London Underground because of Covid Was stopping renewing licenses for buskers on it I haven't really looked into it It's not a huge priority anymore So what I've said is one number five or whatever we are Was to become a better storyteller And I did actually have a private coaching with a chap called Matthew Dix Who is like one of the world's best storytellers He's one bunch of competitions and written a really good book called Storyworthy So I had some sessions with him And I did kind of improve my storytelling ability But initially what started off as like coaching and had to be better storyteller Ended up actually turning into coaching on how to write my book better And I realized that actually the sessions I have with Matthew I would rather we work on the book rather than we work on my verbal storytelling abilities So I think they're fine It's to end it and I decided after a while that this wasn't a huge priority And finally one of my goals for last year was to learn to draw like a concept artist And I really wanted to learn how to draw And I did actually do this for about three or four months I had an art teacher called Alessandro And we had lessons two or three times a week Where I was kind of practicing human anatomy and like learning how to draw and shade And all that kind of stuff And after a few months I realized that I was waking up in the morning And I was like, ah crap, I haven't art as of now And when I had that feeling of ah crap I don't want to do this Like you know I stuck with it for a while I was like okay well you know know everything is fun all the time But my general philosophy for life is that I don't really want to do stuff That feels like a lot of hard work and effort to do I'd rather work with my own natural motivations and work with my energies Energy sounds a bit woo But I'd rather do things that I genuinely enjoy That lead to good outcomes rather than kind of force myself to do these things And the art lessons were fun But after a few months I realized that actually I don't have that much time in my life With all the other stuff that's going on with the book and the business and the YouTube channel And the art lessons became not a priority So I guess if we're thinking about lessons that I've learned for goal setting There's a few things that come to mind Firstly I think it's actually about setting fewer goals rather than more goals I think probably I had too many things last year that I was like you know what I really want to work on this thing And then after a while of working on them I realized actually Hmm Time is starting to run out I kind of want to have a healthy balanced life I don't quite have enough drive or productivity to get absolutely everything done Therefore I'm going to choose to abandon certain activities And this is a thing that a lot of a bookman talks about in his really good book 4,000 weeks Which is that in a dream world We would have the time to do all the things that I had to do this would be up to date We could be replying to all our friends We'd be hosting dinner parties, we'd be crushing it at work, we'd be writing our book In the real world we're actually never going to have time to do all the things we want to do And so we have to strategically decide what are the things that we want to fail at And I strategically decided last year to fail at the art lessons To fail at the busking thing to fail at the six pack ads thing Because I realized that I just don't care enough about those things Compared to the other stuff that I was working on The other thing I realized is that it's a lot easier to work on a goal When that goal is a side effect of something else that you want to do So I'll use an example when I first learn to code I never set out to learn to code I set out to create my personal website and then later to build a game And learning to code was a thing that kind of happened as a side effect of this other wider project That I cared about that I was working towards Similarly, I have friends who learn to play the piano I learned to play properly by following the path and doing things with the classical music and all that jazz And they hated learning to play the piano Because they weren't working towards anything that they fundamentally cared about Whereas I've got other friends including myself I learned to play the piano because I wanted to be able to play Disney songs by ear That was the project that I was aiming for And learning the piano kind of happened as a side effect For the guitar as well I didn't want to learn the guitar I wanted to be able to play chords to accompany myself and my friends Because I had that as a goal learning the guitar kind of happened as a side effect And I think one of the mistakes I made last year is that like You know I've often had on my bucket list like get more fits Take my health more seriously, take stretching more seriously, learn to cook And I've realized recently that I'm never going to learn something just for its own sake in isolation Like I don't know anyone who's learned to code by actually just saying I want to learn to code in the learning The only people I know who've ever learned to code have had projects to work on And I've learned to code as a side effect So this year when it comes to my goal setting What I'm really thinking about is okay If I care about taking cooking seriously How can I make the learning to cook a side effect of something else that I want to do? And finally one thing that I've learned and or rather Realized or appreciated more recently is that it's actually completely okay to change your mind I think a lot of us set ourselves these new year's resolutions and like I want to work on these goals for the year And then we get new data points We realize you know we try it and we fail at some of the stuff and we realize cool That's okay Like the more we try something the more data points we get about the thing And so there's very little point in Whole clinging to this vision that we kind of vaguely decided a year ago just just because we decided a year ago And there's a really good quote that I apparently came from Einstein or all those probably a bit of a myth Where it's like plans are totally pointless But planning is indispensable And I think I think I do fully agree with that Like even within our business we spend a lot of time planning and strategizing And the plans that we come up with are ultimately not really that useful because stuff changes so quickly But the act of planning and the act of actually intentionally figuring out what are my goals for the year What are my goals and health wealth, love happiness and impact? Even if the plan changes just the fact that you spend the time planning is actually helpful Okay, so that was a bit of a review of the goals and the lessons And now I actually have a call to go to and so I'm going to see you in about an hour Let's go Alrighty We are back Let's now talk about the goals that I'm going to be setting for the new year And I have converted my anti waste month system into a notion template linked in the video description Thank you notion of sponsoring this video But I had this template anyway from last year as well I've just turned it into templates rather than tables just to make it a little bit easier to read So for each of my goals I'm going to go through how I'm thinking about how to set the goals using the anti waste month system And we'll see what happens So goal number one is to write my book properly So the dream here is to write my book Or rather the dream is to write a book I'm proud of Now this is an interesting thing with goal setting It's because like before I had like a smart smart goal type thing you know specific measurable or that kind of stuff And I really like I'm not really a huge fan of the whole smart goal vibe Because like I like achievable and realistic kind of the same thing Timely and sort of specific kind of the same thing time But I like this it's it's it's got a few issues with it But we're going to every everyone talks about smart goal setting So we're going to humour that a little bit And crucially it's right a book I'm proud of Because that is a goal that's 100% within my control This is another thing I've realized over the last year that generally For goals that we want to set most of our goals Should be goals that are 100% within our control So I don't want to write a book that hits a New York Times best set of list Although I do but I don't want to have that as a goal Because I don't want to write a book that critics are proud of Although I do but that's I don't want that as a goal Because it relies on someone else Being the gatekeeper to whether I actually accomplish this thing that I want to do I wanted to be a writer book I'm proud of because that is something that's 100% within my control So why don't want to write a book? Well firstly because it's fun And it's going to be fun and it's kind of fun doing process of writing a book Also I now have a bunch of book deals got a book deal in America And in the UK and a bunch of different countries for translation So I actually need to write the book because publishers are paid money for it already And advance and so I now need to deliver on that promise that I've made Which is a pretty compelling reason to write the book It could be an interesting way to reach a New audience People who may not necessarily watch YouTube videos But might read a book could be good and to be honest I've always kind of wanted to write a book And if the book is good it could hopefully unlock Interesting opportunities further down the line So that's why I want to write a book I'm proud of Smart goal wise I want to aim to complete the first draft by the 31st of March And send the final manuscript to the publishers By the 31st of July I'll see if that works Next question is what habits do I want to do that is going to make this more likely to happen And I've already started doing this which is that every single day Except Monday is where we have team meetings all day Every day Tuesday through Sunday from 9 a.m. till 12 noon I have that three hours blocked out for writing time And we've also tried to do is clear my calendar of all the kind of businessy type stuff So I'm not meetings all week which was a problem like earlier this year So that I have more time to write the book Next we have an interesting question How surprised would I be if I failed on a scale of a 1 to 10 So one being not surprised at all and 10 being very surprised I would give myself a seven for this I would be reasonably surprised if I didn't manage to hit these deadlines At the right of the book I'm proud of I'm still maybe in that sort of uninformed optimism stage You know where to talk about with the dip and stuff But honestly I would be pretty surprised if I didn't manage to do this Next we ask what are the top three reasons that I might fail at the goal Okay, so reason number one might be that Don't make enough time to write the book Reason number two might be that it takes longer than expected Make it good and reason number three might be that Urgent things keep propping up So that I never make time for it which kind of relates to point number one Now this is the sort of thing that I find just really useful to think about like what are the top three reasons why I might fail at this thing For whatever goal that I set whether it's at the start of the year or not And I think it's something that more people should think about and any time I have a friend who says hey, I want to really do this thing I asked them okay cool, you know, so just out of curiosity how surprised would you be if you failed and what are the top three reasons you might fail? And the other giant genuinely things that people tend not to ask themselves when it comes to goal setting And so having it as part of the template as part of the system I found last year it was very helpful And I'm hoping it'll be helpful this year as well The next question is who can help who and or how could book by Ben Hardin dance on as well Like who can we enlist to help with the book writing journey so firstly book coach editor's agent team audience like there's a bunch of people who can help on the book writing journey And I've done a bunch of brainstorming to help to figure out how these people might help Next we come to how can I stack the deck to succeed so what are the things I can do to help minimize the You know the risk of that these top three reasons would happen So firstly I can make sure the calendar is always empty for book writing I can tell my team the importance of me having time to write the books So that they don't randomly put stuff in my calendar that interferes with book writing time I can be super disciplined with my writing habit and actually make sure that when I'm sitting down I'm actually writing the book rather than browsing Twitter or other things that I tend to do And to avoid the procrastination thing that's inevitably going to happen I can make it super easy to get started with the book each morning like having the computer out already Knowing what I'm going to write the night before or what I'm in bed the morning go of so that when I get to the computer I can just start writing without having to first think Oh, what did I actually have to do? And then the final question of the anti waste man system is what is the action that I can take right now While I'm doing the school setting thing to make sure I'm well, I will be on my path to achieving my goal And that is blocking up time in the calendar, which I have done already I should actually did that a couple weeks ago making sure that nine to 12 every single morning other than Mondays is blocked out for book writing time Alright, so that was gone number one. Let's move on to go number two So I'm going to click this add a new goal button which conveniently fills all this stuff in I'm not going to bother with it right now But I will fill this in afterwards and it will all be in the template that's linked down below So writing the book is goal number one that I need to do for the year and to be honest If that's the only goal that I managed to accomplish this year I think this year will have been time well spent Go number two for me is to build a sustainable fitness habit I'm not setting a goal this year that like I want to get six pack abs or anything like that Basically, I just want to have a habit whereby I will work out three or four times a week And enjoy myself recently I subscribed to Apple Fitness Plus And I did my first Apple Fitness Plus workout a couple of days ago And I've also been working with an accountability coach who checks in with me every week And says to me, you know, are you making progress on this stuff? And I stick time in my calendar where I'm going to work out and then he messages me as well To be like, hey, how was the workout? And that's just a useful way of me to add in an extra layer of accountability to do this thing That I genuinely want to do, but that I might struggle to do otherwise Ideally, I would have a project that I'm working towards We have a family year, but you know, one thing I've always wanted to do Well, not always for the last few years It's been on my bucket list to become a gym shark athlete Another thing I'm talking with the idea of is like, wouldn't it be cool to try and get Hensh and then get on like the front cover of maybe men's health magazine or something like that Just just with fun, just with the bands But to have a project to work towards so that kind of me working out Is not an exercise and just lifting weights up and down against gravity But it's actually working towards something So similar to the learn to code example and you have a project It's easier to learn the thing Similarly, I think if I had a fitness project it would be easier to actually keep up the sustainable fitness journey Go on number three was actually to learn to cook But since the stuff that I've learned this year about goal setting I have changed the goal away from learn to cook I've made the goal to host regular dinner parties So what I did I want to do is every one or two weeks I want to host a party an intimate dinner at my flat in London Or I invite some friends over and I want to try and mix up friendship groups So that my friends from different circles can get to know one another And I'll make it a point instead of ordering Take away for those dinner parties I will have to cook something for those dinner parties So I'm hoping that this little project will be a forcing function that encourages me to learn how to cook And since I've set this you know Actually, I think tomorrow evening is my first kind of trial dinner party I've messaged a few friends from university and watching them over I don't have any idea what I'm going to cook yet But I've been watching a lot of YouTube videos Binging with Babish and Ethan and like Alex French guy and pro-home cooks And these are the cool cooking YouTube channels So hopefully tomorrow's meal will go well Go on number four is to take stretching more seriously So I have really bad posture I've got anterior pelvic tilt and I'm not very flexible at all And so for the last few years I've had do stretching on my new year's resolutions list But this year I now have a project to work towards And that is that I want to learn acro yoga Acro yoga is that really cool thing that really cool people like Sam Kolder and stuff Do where it's like I mean it will put them be raw here You've got people on the floor You've got like a base and you've got a flyer And like with a partner you're doing this cool yoga stuff together Yes acro yoga is something that I really want to do But to get reasonable acro yoga You have to actually be able to do a straight leg raise at the base Because I'm lucky to be the base, of course And my hamstring flexibility is just so so so bad So I've actually been working on my hamstrings over the last couple of weeks The way I do it is when I'm brushing my teeth My electric toothbrush tells me every 30 seconds it like buzzes So for each 30 seconds I do like one leg The other leg one leg the other leg In terms of hamstring stretches and I have actually found that my hamstring flexibility has Notescibly improved in the last two or three weeks of doing this with brushing my teeth Because I'm trying to get my hamstrings more flexible to the point that I can then successfully be a base during acro yoga So again this is another example of where having the project of trying acro yoga Requires me to be a baseline level of flexibility And I'm hoping that will be fun because acro yoga seems really cool But be that it will help me kind of get to my flexibility and stretching goal Without that being an explicit goal And got number five we have to get better at singing Honestly, I don't really have a project associated with this I probably should maybe something around busking Maybe busking in London maybe busking in London Underground maybe in common garden in these cool places in London But to be honest I could just do that anyway And I have bust in Cambridge before so I just really want to get better at singing Because ultimately I do want to make music videos on YouTube Maybe for my second channel maybe with the team We've got a few people in the team who are absolutely sick at music Absolutely sick at singing and I really like the idea of making like a team band Where we film voice avenue style videos here in the studio In fact that would be a pretty good project for the year That would encourage me to get better at singing Encourage me to get better at piano and guitar and music theory So that we can form this band So that's going to be a little project Right so those are my personal goals That's what I'm following this anti waste man system for The stuff that I want to do myself Then we have a bunch of business goals as well We've been working with business coach and following this method And a book called Traction that's called the entrepreneurial operating system And we have six main goals for the year The first one is that we want to run three successful cohorts of our part-time youtuber Academy Where hopefully we can get fifteen hundred students and make a revenue of three million pounds Three million dollars something like that from our youtuber Academy That would be really cool as go number one Go number two is to launch a bunch of other kind of evergreen courses So that we can hopefully get to the point where by the end of the year We're making a hundred thousand pounds a month from our extra courses other than the youtuber Academy Go number three is to have the book written that is a personal goal But it's also business goals so other people are hopefully going to be helping along the way And giving me the motivation to succeed at that Go number four is that we want to have a very classy and nice and non sales manny Sales and marketing funnel for our courses. I don't really like the way a bunch of these like internet gurus do it And I want to do it in a nice way that doesn't shove things down people's threats That would be ideal. Go number five is that we have a like core processes in the business Which are documented and followed by everyone at the moment We have a reasonably large team of seventeen people But we've really run to the problem where the people who are here in the early day So like me Angus Christian Elizabeth We have a bunch of stuff in our head of stuff that we just done And like when new people come into the business because that stuff's not written down anywhere It's like really hard for them to get up to speed and what's going on So basically we want to have a we want to get to a point where all of the key processes of the stuff that we do For our courses and videos and podcasts and socials and blog etc etc It's all written down so that someone else could come in and sort of follow the checklist As it were and finally there's this new YouTube channel project that we're launching We're hoping to get to at least a hundred thousand subscribers And I'm not really a fan of these goals like the thing is that like as I said before Like I'm a fan broadly of goals that are within my control And having a certain revenue count count a certain sort of subscriber count a certain kind of amount of followers That kind of thing it's a goal that's not really within our control But it is there is just sort of a thing for the business I don't like having those goals personally And then we break those down as a business into goals that are within our control as well Now if you want to follow this anti waste man system for goal setting You will find the notion template linked down in the video description And completely coincidentally notion are also sponsoring this video If you haven't heard by now notion is just like the ultimate It's it's like a cross between like a Google Docs and Google Sheets and like web design software And like a content management system and just like it's basically an app that I have been using to organize my life for the last two years Back in the day you know people used to come up to me and be like hey I bought an iPad because of your recommendation These days most people who recognize me on the streets and London or whatever say I started using notion because of your recommendations Because I made a couple of it a few videos about notion back in the day We still use notion from basically everything in the business We are living in notion all day all of our videos are written in notion and I even use notion to track things like my anti waste man system My annual reviews for my personal goals as well If you want to check out notion then hit the link in the video description is completely free You can pay for the extra plan if you want but you can easily get by with notion by using the completely free plan And you can check the link in the video description for my anti waste man template as well Which you can then duplicate into your own workspace completely for free now to pay a penny And you can do this goal setting system if that's the sort of thing that's up your street So thank you notion for sponsoring this video And thank you for watching this far if you enjoyed this video You might like to check out this video over here, which is the 21 or so life lessons that I learned in 2021 That might be interesting if you want to see the stuff that I've learned throughout the year in addition to my philosophies I'm goal setting So thank you so much for watching do hit the subscribe button if you are already And I'll see you hopefully in the next video, bye
