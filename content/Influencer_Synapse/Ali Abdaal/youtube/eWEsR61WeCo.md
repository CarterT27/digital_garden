This is our first music thing in a while. Hoping to make it more of a regular event. Zobia studied History at Cambridge and now works at a bank in London, and Suhail studied Engineering at Cambridge, studied in MIT for a year, worked as a product designer at Apple for a year, and is now a management consultant in London. They're both super talented musicians, can't wait to feature more of them on the channel. Enjoy xx

## Transcript
 Hey guys, welcome back to the channel. Today we're going to be hearing a cover of yellow by Coldplay performed by me, Sahil and Zobia. So Helen Zobia are two of my friends. They're used to go to Cambridge. We became friends by the Pakistan Society. But while I'm still a medical student because it's 60 years long, they've long since graduated and are now working like high flying city jobs. But occasionally when they get some time off or on the weekends they come to Cambridge and we like getting together to sing songs. The music is one of my biggest passions and I definitely want to keep the music thing going alongside being a doctor. So yeah, occasionally we might be seeing more videos of me and my friends singing songs. I hope you guys don't mind. But here we go. Here is me Sahil and Zobia performing yellow by Coldplay. I really hope you enjoy it. Look at the stars. Look how this shine for you and everything you do. Yeah, they were all yellow. I came alone. I wrote a song for you. Oh, what a thing to do. And it was called her. So then I took my turn. Oh, what a thing to attend. And it was all yellow. And you're skin. Oh, yeah, you're skin and bones. Turn it into something beautiful. You know, you know, I love you so, you know, I love you so. I swam across. I jumped across for you. Oh, what a thing to do. And it was all yellow. I drew a lie. I drew a lie for you. Oh, what a thing to do. And it was all yellow. And you're skin. Oh, yeah, you're skin and bones. Turn it into something beautiful. You know, for you, I've lead my soul. Drive for you, I've lead my soul. It's true. Look how this shine for you. Look how this shine for you. Look how this shine for you. Look how this shine for you. Look how this shine. Look at the stars. Look how this shine for you. And everything you do.
