## Transcript
 Hey, everyone. Welcome back to the channel. Let's talk about reading today and specifically how and why to read faster. So we'll talk about why being able to read faster is a useful skill to have in your pocket and then I'll share five tips that I've found really helpful for increasing my own reading speed so that I can absorb more stuff from the books that I read. So why bother reading fast? Like isn't reading supposed to be one of the things that you take it slow? You enjoy the process and you gain a lot of insight from the book. I think that's sometimes true but it's not always and I kind of think of it like writing a bike. So it's like sometimes when you're writing a bike you want to really enjoy the journey and you want to smell the roses along the way so you want to go at like three miles per hour so you can breathe it all in. But sometimes when you're writing a bike your objective is to get from A to B and let's say you're running late for work for your lectures you actually don't really care about smelling the roses on the way there you just want to get there as quickly as possible. And I think of reading in the same way like if a book is really good then I will read it slowly and take my time and take loads of notes throughout and like smell the roses on the way there. But the problem is that most books and most nonfiction books these days tend to be like big idea books where it's like one central idea and then the rest of the 400 pages of the book is just example after example after example kind of bashing you over the head with examples to explain that one idea which you got from the introduction or from the first few chapters. And so in those cases if I've got the main idea from the book or if it's just not capturing my interest very much often I would just blitz through the rest of the book. Yes you could say that once you've got the main idea then you might as well just abandon the book and in general I'm a very big fan of treating books less like hallowed objects and more like blog posts which is like if you get halfway through a book or even 20% of the way through a book and it's not capturing your attention anymore then it's fine it's okay to abandon it. But even though theoretically I believe that and I will fully subscribe to that mindset in real life I often get a feeling of foamer that I'm missing out on like some gold dust that might be sprinkled in the book maybe halfway through or maybe three quarters of the way through and so in general even if I've got the main idea from a book I will prefer to just kind of blitz read it very very fast rather than abandon it completely so reading faster helps with that but if you know how to refaster then your own default reading speed just improves without sacrificing any comprehension and so for me now it's actually reduced to the time and emotional investment needed to read a book like if someone recommends a book to me I know it's not going to take me six months to read the book I know it'll take me a few hours to read the book because I can read pretty fast if I want to and therefore I'm far more likely to pick up the book that someone recommends and read it and I've discovered so many good books and so many average books through that recommendation process so that's why reading faster can sometimes be helpful I'm not saying you should do it all the time I'm not saying you should speed read like a productivity grease monkey I'm saying it is a useful skill to have in your pocket for when you need it all right so tip number one for reading faster is to try and reduce sub vocalization and sub vocalization is what it is when we're sort of we've got that voice in our heads that is reading as we go along this is controversial like if you look at the evidence behind speed reading and waste in previous reading speed there are some people that say that sub vocalization is legit there are some people say that it's not legit I am not commenting on the evidence here I'm commenting anecdotally and anecdotally I know that for me when I'm reading faster I read visually like I see the words and I don't like sound them out in my head whereas when I'm reading slowly or in really enjoying a book or if like I'm really savoring it or if it's a very difficult topic then I'll be doing the sub vocalizing in my head I'll be reading in my head as I go along that obviously means that I read more slowly but it does increase my comprehension anecdotally as well when slow readers ask me how I read fast and I tell them the sub vocalization thing it blows their minds because they just think that that is just how you have to read you have to read by having this voice going along in your head in my opinion in my experience you can reduce that amount to increase your speed of reading there is some evidence about this like there are some studies where they do functional MRI scanning of people's brains and they have like fast readers and slow readers and the fast readers have less activation in the bits of the brain that are responsible for speech and that may be some evidence that reducing sub vocalization is actually legit but whatever the evidence says I think that if you want to increase your reading speed just try and reduce that voice in your head and kind of see what happens it will start up very uncomfortable and you'll kind of be like blitzing through the text and not quite understanding it but with enough practice this will become second nature and then you'll think huh why do people read with a voice in their heads when it's just like so much faster to just look at the words and to not have the voice in your head point number two for reading faster you actually don't have to read the whole page you can kind of read a little bit in from the page on either side and I picked up this tip from Tim Ferriss is the four hour work week he's also got a YouTube video about it and I hadn't figured it out before but when I started applying this I did notice I'd go to the again my own reading speed started to increase and there are apparently speed readers around the world who swear by this method basically the idea is that because when we look at a word our peripheral vision can like see the words around the word and so really like normally we look at the very first word of a line but then we're wasting peripheral vision because there's like empty space to the side whereas if we start like a little bit in and we kind of track our eyes not from the start of the text at the end of the text but like a little bit in we can actually still see all the words and visually read without wasting that space so again this is something that I find that if I'm actively trying to refaster then I will do this normally I don't remember normally I just kind of read naturally but if I'm actively trying to refaster what I do is kind of shift my eyes from sort of the the page almost as if there's like a ruler on the end of the page and so I'm only looking I'm only allowed to look in between those areas and I found that that improves my reading speed again this is somewhat controversial like there are some studies that show that this effect does not exist and it definitely for me and for Tim Ferriss and for Nelson Dallas who is another guy who reads fast to my interview on my channel it does sort of work so maybe try it see if it works for you I find personally that it works for me thirdly if you want to refaster what you can do is you can take a pointer and you can just like kind of scan your your finger across the page this works a lot better when you're not reading on a screen or when you're not reading on a candle that has a touch screen but if you're reading like a real book the way it works is that because when our eyes move they actually don't move in smooth and in fact like so if you if you look at my eyes right now I'm gonna try moving them smoothly from left to right back again but it's actually impossible so eyes moving in terms of so cards and so it's like a bang bang bang bang bang bang bang the only way eyes can move smoothly is if they're tracking something so if I if you now look in my eye now it's moving smoothly because it's tracking my index finger whereas if I remove my index finger there is no way I can like force my eyes to like move smoothly and because our eyes moving that kind of sacada quay usually when we're reading we're not following smoothly one line to the next line we're sort of kind of sacadaing back and forth and that inferior waste a lot of time while you're reading so if you want to improve your reading what you can do you can take a finger and just kind of scan it along the line as fast as you want and you kind of force your eye to follow your finger and that means that you're not wasting any eye time and doing sacada back and forth between bits of the same line. I haven't found any studies that talk about this in depth but there's this dude called Howard Berg who is like you know world record holder for speed reading and he says that just by using a pointer you can increase your reading speed by 10 to 20 percent so I think that's pretty good point number four something I find helpful is to kind of gamify the whole reading faster thing so normally when I'm reading and I'm reading a good book like I said I will read slowly I'll take my time I'll take notes all of that kind of stuff but if it gets to a point where I'm losing interest in a book or if it's a fiction book and there's just loads of description that I don't want to read about because I'm just so engrossed in the storyline or if I just want to kind of blitz through the rest of the book I will kind of treat it as a bit of a game for myself to see how quickly I can read without sacrificing too much of my comprehension and especially with nonfiction books what I do is that I think to myself okay this book's going boring now let me turn this into a game and I'm going to see how quickly I can read while still understanding the gist of the chapter. In general I'm a big fan of gamifying all of the different components of my life because it just makes life more interesting and it means that skill acquisition like learning new stuff just becomes so much more fun when you turn it into a little game that you play with yourself that sounds weird and finally if you want to take in more from what you're reading this is not really a tip for reading faster but it's still useful it's actually to write a summary or a review of the book that you've just read if I'm trying to speed read I will do this but I've also started doing this with all of the fiction and nonfiction books that I'm reading and the easiest way I found to take these notes from books after I read them is by using notion who are very kindly sponsoring this video if you guys haven't heard notion is like my favorite app in the world and I use it for absolutely everything from like my notes for medical school to teaching assignments to tracking my gym workouts to handling all of the elements of this YouTube channel to work it with my team and also recently to take books from all the notes that I've ever read so I've actually got two different templates for this I have a fiction template and a nonfiction template they're going to be linked in the video description so you can duplicate them into your own workspace by the way notion is completely free so if you haven't got an account you should sign up for one link in the video description and so within my book notes database let's take for example show your work by hosting play on this is what I'm taking right seriously this is a nonfiction book and so what I've got is I have the book in three sentences impressions who should read it how the book changed me and my top three quotes and that is like the minimum that I will do for every book that I read and if I'm feeling particularly keen I will do like a whole summary and notes about the book which I am working on slowly publishing to my website and I think just doing this even just doing like the book in three sentences really helps me engage with something especially if it's a book that I've speed read or like read really fast and I've got the main idea it forces me to really think okay have I actually understood what this book is about and if not I'll just open it up on Kindle and just kind of blitz through again to find out okay what was the key point here and can I put it into my own words and for fiction books I've got another template that has kind of what it's about how I discovered it and didn't just some general thoughts on the book again I'm working on uploading these to my website so I can have a nice list of all the books I've ever read including reviews and ratings and notes and summaries and all that good stuff so if you want to read fast or I'd highly recommend you also take notes and summaries of the books that you've read after the fact so that you can test your understanding of them and do some active recall and space repetition on that and as I said notion is my favorite way of doing this three templates free download everything linked in the video description if you like this video you might like to check out the video over here which is called how I remember everything that I read which is about the seven different levels of this whole thing about taking notes from books this what we've talked about is about level five but there are lots of levels before and a couple of levels after so you should definitely check out that video for cover here thank you for watching and see you in the next and we'll see you in the next video, bye-bye
