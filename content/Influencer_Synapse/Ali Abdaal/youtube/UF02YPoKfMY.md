## Transcript
 Hey guys, welcome back to the channel. If you're new here, my name is Ali. I'm a junior doctor working in Cambridge and in this video I'm gonna be taking you through every single thing that I have in my bag on a daily basis So let's start with the bag and the bag is the full via 25 litre hybrid bag pack. I think it's cool It's either the tool or totally or fuel. I looked on the internet and people had different ideas about how to pronounce this. I love this thing For disclosure, they sent this to me for free to review and I said that if I like to I'd make a video including it But they're not paying me to say this or anything. I just absolutely love this, which is why it's been being included in this video And I've been using it every day for the last few months to carry to work But also to carry pretty much anywhere. I go outside of the house So let's start with the most important thing. I take to work and that is of course Mike 2018 I pad pro with apple pencil and smart keyboard folio case thing So that goes in this pocket of the bag. So as you can see this like pockets for like laptop I pad Kindle cheeky bit of foreshadowing as to what's gonna come in this video and then usually at work I also carry my gym kit, which is another thing that I absolutely love about this bag There is a pocket at the bottom that you can put shoes in and there shoes get tucked away and then when you flip this pouch You've got this kind of big pocket that you can put all the other gym kit in so underwear shorts usually from Nike top I like the gym shark once these days because they make me look a bit hensh and they like squeeze your eyes Vicep so you feel like you're really pro and this like microfiber towel that folds down really nicely and then over the top I just shove my stethoscope which I then take out when I get to work and put on to complete the uniform of the junior doctor life Also whenever I'm at work, I always have my apple AirPods with me I absolutely love these things. They are quite high on the list of Recommended tech that I would recommend for everyone so these usually go in my pocket And then I listen to stop on the way to work But then when I'm at work, I just shove them into this little pocket up here Which is quite cool you get to put like whatever you want to keys charges AirPods and that's all the stuff So that was everything that I carry to work. I keep it quite minimal the main thing is the iPad The stethoscope of course and the gym kit, but then let's say I'm going away for the weekend or if I'm going to town to a coffee shop to do some editing Then this whole setup kind of expands a bit and everything still comfortably fits in the back So the most important thing is of course like 2018 15 inch MacBook Pro. This is the i9 version with the 32 gigs of RAM and the one terabyte hard drive so that goes in like the main laptop pocket and if I'm going home for the weekend Or if I'm going to be spending the night anyway, then I take my Kindle with me because this is like the best thing to do either like on trains If I'm not editing or just before bed, so that also conveniently goes in one of the pockets of this bag If I know I'm going to be doing some editing I usually have my dongle because this is a MacBook Pro Therefore it needs a dongle. This is the satachi USB aluminium hub thing bag gets shoved in there somewhere And I often carry my four terabyte Western digital hard drive, which has backups of all my footage so that gets shoved in there That pretty much covers this pocket. Let's now talk about the gym pocket Which more stuff gets piled into so if I'm going away I often have with me my camera. I usually carry the a6500 Sony a6500 with me, but that's being used to film this So this is a replica. I was not replica. It's the Sony a6000. This is the first camera I ever had and is Probably the single most valuable purchase I've ever made in my entire life because it's absolutely wonderful And it's made so many amazing memories. So I always carry a camera with me if I'm going anywhere for an extended period of time to get those Great shots for the gram if I know I'm going to be going on trains or planes I carry my bows QC35 noise cancelling Bluetooth headphones these are wonderful They're the noise cancelling is literally magical and they're super comfortable to wear for extended periods of time Like it's shoved in the gym bag as well. That covers that pocket And then you know we got this like flappy flappy pocket that sits over the top This is a good place to store chargers because then they're not in the way and they don't like dig into your back When when you're carrying the bag. So we've got the MacBook Pro charger the USB C1 Which now conveniently charges my iPad it was as well but in addition to that I also carry this banker for port charger that always has a lightning cable a micro USB and the Apple watch charging cable I think so that always goes in the bag as well and just for good measure I carry one of these anchor power banks. I don't even know what model it is But it's just a standard one you can get these off Amazon or anywhere else and finally if I know I'm going to be taking photos and stuff I usually carry around some spare batteries if I'm going to be using the camera for extended periods of time Oh my god, this is getting quite heavy and then The nice thing about this is once you've parted everything into it and you can do up this bit of it over here and then that strap goes down there And now you've shoved everything into this bag So this is like enough to last me a weekend I can put spare clothes. I've got a spare pair of shoes. I've got the laptop the iPad the Kindle the hard drives the headphones the AirPods two different chargers It's just this is just amazing and now this is quite a hefty quite a hefty uh setup But if I want to wear it I just swing it over my shoulders and now I've got what I hope is a reasonably Compact well sort of compact is quite big. It's got loads of stuff in it Originally compact quite nice looking setup and I quite like this kind of blue color for this tool via backpack It's very nice and there's pretty much goes with everything. I wear it because everything I wear is pretty much just a great He shirt and black jeans at all times so that was everything in my bag I hope you found this video sent me useful if you did please give it a thumbs up if you haven't subscribed to the channel Please consider doing so have a lovely day and I will see you in the next video. Goodbye
