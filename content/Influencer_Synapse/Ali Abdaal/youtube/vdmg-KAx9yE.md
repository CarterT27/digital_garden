 Go in back to the corner where I first saw you gonna Can't be my sleeping bag, I'm not gonna move Got these words, I'll come, I'll got you Picture in my hand, say it If you see this girl, can you tell where I am To have me money, they don't Understand, I'm not broke I'm just a broken hearted man I know it makes no sense for what else You gotta do it, I'll get out of the ball And I'm still in love with you Was it one day you wake up and find that promise in me And you're almost those two wanderers And the surd I could be Dick and baby, you'd jump back into the place that we'd need After a scene you waited for you One little corner of the street And I'm not moving I'm not moving Police man says, I can't say it But someone I'm waiting for me at a day I'm on the air, I've got to stand My cry of a prayer in the snow She changes the fight, this is the first place She will go out and one day you wake up And find that promise in me And you're almost those two wanderers And the surd I could be Dick and baby, you'll come back into the place And you're almost those three wanderers And the surd I could be And you're almost those two wanderers You'd jump back into the place But the big hole in this world Oh, I've made me I get famous As a matter of game it moves And maybe you won't be too much You'll see me up and news And you come right into the corner Because you know it's just for you I'm the bad who can't be blue I'm the bad who can't be blue Because if what are you wake up And find that you're missing me And your heart starts to wonder Where up is that I could be Thinking maybe you'll come back into the place That we meet And you'll see waiting for you Who on the door on the street And I'm not blue I'm not blue I'm not blue I'm not blue I'm not blue But you can't know where I'm I saw you gonna Happy my sleeping bed I'm not gonna move I'm not gonna move
