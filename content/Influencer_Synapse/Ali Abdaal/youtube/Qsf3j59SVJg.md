My mum, brother and I spent 5 days in Iceland over the Christmas holidays. We were based in Reykjavik and took day trips to various locations around Iceland, attempting to get some cool-looking shots with our cameras and learning how to fly a drone (DJI Mavic Pro). Enjoy xx

## Transcript
 Today we're going to be following the Golden Circle. Our main goal is going to be to try and get as many shots cinematic, slow mode, all of that as we can with the cameras at the drone. All right, so we've just driven through this pretty massive flizzards. It's pretty mental. You know, you can just be driving along the same road and 10 minutes later the scenery, the weather completely changes. This is, this is so cool. All right, it's Christmas Eve and we're hanging in the town center. It seems of Reykjavik. It's very cute. Lots of lights around. It's a bit like a model town. I don't expect. All right, there are two of the perfect and we're journeying to the south coast of the island. Apparently the views are out of this world. We've got some drone shots of the sunrise already. The landscape is changing every half an hour or so. It's really, really awesome. All right, we found this spot that has like three different waterfalls on it. I think we're going to name the drone headwicks. Someone suggested this when I posted on Snapchat yesterday. That seems like a legit name. The only problem is that headwicks is currently dark gray and evil looking. So, I reckon if I can find some kind of stickers for her, we can make her white. Okay, so we've stopped by this amazing sunset. We've got to somehow get across that, so my brother's going to try and grab across it while I film it in slow motion as one does. So that was interesting. The number plate of the car just fell off. That's interesting. All right, what's on this alley? Yeah, but. All right, guess we're going to do that later onwards and upwards. All right, day three of our ice then trip. We're journeying, do south of Reykjavik to this mountainous area. Apparently the scenery is pretty awesome. So we're here at sunrise. Yeah, this place is pretty sick. So we think we found some hot water springs. Oh my god, how much? That's like, that's that's level of reporting. That's incredible. I never thought these actually like exist in the winter. Oh my god, that's really, really hot. How do you feel? I feel like I'm at one with nature. You get me. All right guys, we spotted the northern lights. Gonna set up the tripod trying to get a long exposure photograph of them. Let's see what happens. All right, so it's the final day of the trip. We're hanging out in one of the towns near Reykjavik. We're going to be watching Rybred being baked from like one of the natural springs or the beach or something like that. So yeah, the tour sets off in about 15 minutes. We're going to get some cheeky shots of this lake in the sunrise. Maybe fly the drone. Let's see what it looks like. I'm just buttering the Rybred here. It tastes like Rybred. Hi, my name is Flina and I'm from Iceland. I've been working as a painter for 17 years. These are my downloads of the light. What I intend to do is to make the view or feel good. This is energy work. When I paint and meditate, I connect with my higher self and with the universe and something comes into the life.
