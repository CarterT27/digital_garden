## Transcript
 Hello and welcome back to the BMAT tips series. My name is Alay, I'll be your host for this episode and today We're going to be talking about section two maths and I'm going to be giving you some top tips on how to do well in it I am recording this in Ho Chi Minh city airport We've got about an hour left until our flight. So I thought I'd do the totally normal thing and bust out the camera and Record a video about the BMAT anyway. Let's just jump right into it There are three important tips that we're going to be going over today Number one is going to be about fractions number two is going to be about times tables and Number three is going to be about guessing and answer in moving on. Let's start with point number one fractions There is a mantra that we teach on all of our BMAT crash courses and we've been teaching it for the last five years And students have found it enormously helpful and that mantra is fractions are our friends Why do we say this? We say this because fractions come up pretty much throughout the whole BMAT paper Section one problem solving involves fractions section two chemistry involves fractions section two physics and section two maths all in whole fractions In fact, the only thing that doesn't involve fractions is section one critical thinking, which is about Seventeen questions in the whole paper and section three, which is the right in task obviously So getting good at fractions is a really good way of boosting your BMAT score In fact, if there's only one thing you do between now and the BMAT Improving your skill at fractions is probably going to give you the biggest increase in BMAT score What do we mean by fractions? Well firstly, you need to be able to add subtract multiply divide and simplify fractions Quite easily and quite quickly and secondly You need to be able to convert percentages and decimals into fractions because numbers are far easier to work way The when they're in fraction form than when they're in percentage or decimal form usually in fact What we recommend for when you're doing any kind of BMAT question if you ever see a number in percentage of decimal form Just converted to a fraction straightaway because chances are you'll need an infraction form to be able to work with it later on Obviously this is when within reason if you see zero point two eight and you have to multiply by a hundred You don't need to convert that into a fraction to do that just you know You need a bit of common sense with this fractions are our friends fractions really important doing well Fractions are going to boost our BMAT score secondly Let's talk about mental maths getting pro at mental maths is kind of associated with the whole fraction thing But getting pro at mental maths will also massively boost your BMAT score because like I said section one problem solving section two chemistry Section two physics and section two maths all involve maths some sort usually that requires you to do some kind of thing with fractions And being good at mental maths will just speed that up so actually will point please please please Know your times tables at least up to 12 inside out. You shouldn't be having to think when asked You know if the question requires you to work out seven times eight or like nine times six or stuff like that Unfortunately the people who are the best at mental maths tend to do very well in the BMAT as well Because you just save so much time if you can do these calculations quickly Of course in the BMAT you know to have a calculator so you have to do everything in your head and there are almost no questions in BMAT That require you to do like long division or like long multiplication or things like that It's all short snap he sums plus minus times divide that you can just do in your head One way of practicing your mental maths is actually a website called squeaksums.com Which was coincidentally made by my brother and in that you just take 30 seconds and just do lots of mental maths Sums as quickly as you can and it gives you a leaderboard It's kind of like that brain training Nintendo DS program that we used to play back in the day I don't know if you guys still play that thing whether it's still around But when I was in school you'd challenge your math teachers to a competition of brain training To see who could do the most mental maths songs in under 10 seconds or something like that Anyway, yeah mental maths is the way forward getting private mental maths will improve your section to math school But as I said it'll also improve your score in section one problem solving section 2 chemistry section 2 physics So that was point number two point number three Please don't be afraid to guess and answer and move on and this applies very much to the maths questions in section two quite a lot of the maths section two questions are pretty hard and ordinarily you wouldn't be able to do them in under one minute There are going to be about seven section two maths questions and maybe three or four of them are going to be not doable in one minute If you're a normal person so the trick to doing well in section two maths is to recognize these questions quite quickly on and just guess and answer and move on They're not worth your time in fact What we've seen quite a few times three years is that we get some students who are amazing at maths We've got a hundred percent in GCSE 100 percent in their asses who've got gold medals in the maths and in pairs That's sort of thing and yet they still get a low section two mark And I think one of the reasons for that is that when it comes to the maths questions they get this kind of thing in their head That right this is the maths question I know it's only GCSE standard. I'm going to get this question right and then they spend three minutes on the question and end up leaving five questions in the whole paper blank That's not the way forward Please recognize the hard maths questions and don't even attempt them if you think you can't do them in under a minute What I did when I was taking the B-mart and each year when I do the B-mart section two paper on the time conditions is that if I see a maths question and it requires some kind of shape thing I just guess and answer and leave it until the end because I know that there've been that maths shape questions are going to be quite hard I'm not very good at kind of rotating shapes in my head. That's sort of thing I would just leave it till the end come back to it because ultimately we want to be finishing the paper Putting down an answer for all 27 questions at least and then we can always come back to it if we have time in the end Which we probably won't because section two is quite hard and quite time intensive So yeah, if you find that it's taking you over a minute to answer any questions section two Especially the maths questions just guess and answer move on come back to it the end if you've got time and even better If you can identify in the first 10 seconds that this question is going to take you a long time Don't even bother attempting it just guess and answer move on come back to it The end if you've got time So those were my top three tips for how to do one section two maths number one fractions are our friends Which applies to the rest of the B-mart as well number two? Please get good at mental maths Which applies to the rest of the B-mart as well and number three Please don't be afraid to leave a question and move on Which actually also applies to the whole B-mart But is it especially true of the maths questions because those are the ones that people for some reason don't seem to want to skip Not quite sure why let's talk about content now You'll notice that none of the three top tips were anything to do with content really There were more about like mental maths and skills with fractions and things Finally let's talk about practice if you've watched the other videos You know I keep talking on about practice and I keep on saying that the best way to do well In section one and section two is just do lots and lots of practice questions This is kind of true for section two maths as well and I say kind of because obviously doing more questions is useful But section two maths is not like section one critical thinking for example Where if you do 500 questions you'll probably do very well Section two maths tends not to be that formulaic the questions are usually quite novel every year and it takes a bit of intuition a bit of mathematical reasoning to get the answer So the best way to practice the maths questions is Doing also them but also doing them on the strict time conditions and even more importantly Making sure you know where you went wrong for questions you've got wrong so that you can develop the intuition You can develop the skills and if that question type comes up again Then you'll be you'll be able to know what's going on very conveniently There is a website would be Matt Ninja which I plug in every single one of these videos which is amazing for this on Be Matt Ninja there are 2000 free be Matt questions of which a few hundred or maths questions that you can just do completely free of charge And if you're serious about the beam at this is pretty much a no-brainer We've got all of the beam at questions from the last like 15 years worth of papers and then some that we've written ourselves That you can do completely free of charge so you might as well And if you do get stuff wrong, we also got word solutions to every single question in the question bank That were written by Oxford Medical students who tried to kind of explain the reasoning behind it and explain how they got the answer in an efficient fashion Yes, we do charge 29 pounds for access to these word solutions Finally because we had to pay thousands of pounds to get the Oxford Medical students to actually write them in the first place But if money is an issue we have a massive grocery scheme that gives up like tens of thousands of pounds to students each year You literally just send us an email and we will give you whatever discount you want off the solutions or off anything on the website So I mean if you can afford it 29 pounds isn't much if you can't get in touch with us or work something out So yeah, let's conclude this video and I will go off to catch my flight We talked about three top tips of the VMA those were number one fractions or our friends number two Please let's learn our mental maths and times tables and Point number three. Let's not be afraid to guess and move on because the mass questions are quite hard and finally We talked a little bit about practice where I mentioned you should be doing all of the questions on VMA Ninja you might as well the rule available for free It's pretty much a no-brainer If you want you can if you can pay for access to the solutions or you can just comment over here if you're having difficulty with something I will get back to you with a work solution as soon as I can So yeah, thank you very much for watching this video If you haven't seen the rest of the videos on the series, I recommend you check them out They're pretty reasonable and I give some pretty reasonable advice in the next few videos We'll be talking about section three and then after that we might do a deeper dive into some of the section one In section two topics if you've got any questions about the BMAT or about anything at all or if you'd like to suggest some topics that I can cover in one of these videos Please let me know in the comments below and I will definitely get back to you Not many people comment on these videos at the moment so like I you know genuinely do read everything and we'll take it into account So yeah, thank you so much for watching this video I really hope you've gained something from it. Have a lovely evening and we'll see you in the next one. Bye
