## Transcript
 Right, so life is a bit weird. It's an ever-ending tapestry of hundreds of small decisions that we make each day, and these small decisions add up to create our experience of life. The problem is that because there's so many of them, we can get caught up in anxiety and stress, trying to optimize each one, and worry about choosing the best option each time. Now, one solution to this problem of decision fatigue is to use mental models, or rules, or principles, to help simplify our decision making. And so, in this video, I'm going to go over 10 of the rules that I try to live by each day to make my life more organized and to help filter through the noise. Alright, rule number one is the three seas, and that's consume, create, and connect. And these are broadly the three main things that I use tech for. And so, every day, when I see in the news and like on the verge and other kind of YouTube channels that, oh, there's this fancy new tech product, I think about the three seas, and think about, is this product going to add value to my life? Either in terms of consumption, like will it make it easier or more pleasurable to consume the things I want to consume? This is why buying a Kindle is great because it makes reading books much easier. Secondly, could this new thing make it easier for me to create stuff, which is why I don't know buying a new laptop that has a nicer keyboard, like a nicer keyboard, a nicer keyboard, it was a nicer way to create things. Also, it's going to help me connect to people a little bit better. So, like, should I really upgrade from the iPhone 10 to the iPhone 12, would it really help me connect with my friends a little bit better? And then, if we have a tech on the three seas, I decide, cool, I probably want this piece of tech in my life, but if we don't, I think, okay, this piece of tech is probably going to be a waste of time, and I'm not going to buy it. Rule number two is that I always want to invest in things that take me from zero to one, rather than one to one point one. And what I mean here is that, like, zero to one, like, if you go from not having a phone to having a phone, that's a zero to one difference. Whereas, if you go from the iPhone 8 to the iPhone 10, that's not zero to one, that's like one to one point zero five. It's like a very incremental upgrade versus a completely novel upgrade. This is usually why people ask me, you know, what piece of tech would you buy for, like, under $500 or things like that. I usually recommend getting an actual camera, because the difference between not having an actual camera to having an actual camera is a big difference, because it means you suddenly start to take more and more photos and those photos are really nice and high quality, and I'm really glad I bought a camera when I was at university, because now I have these incredibly high quality photos of my friends, of my experience in med school, that just doesn't compare to what you can get from a smartphone, even though phone cameras are pretty good these days. And so I'm always on the lookout for these zero to one kind of improvements, going from not having a Kindle to having a Kindle, going from not having a laptop to having a laptop rather than thinking about, I need to always have the best thing each time and make incremental upgrades. All right, rule number three is Hellia or no, which is a great time management tip by my friend Derek Sivers and the title of this book, Hellia or no, it's very good, would recommend link in the video description, and I'll cut to Derek talking about this. We tend to say yes to too many things and because of this we're spread to Finn. We're so busy doing average things that we don't have time for the occasional great thing. So instead I propose raising the bar as high as you can, so that if you're feeling anything less than oh hell yeah that would be amazing, then just say no, by doing this you will miss out on many good things, but that's okay because your time will be quite empty. So then by saying no to the merely good things you'll have the time and the energy and the space in your life to throw yourself in entirely when that occasional great thing comes up. Now this is a lesson that I need to remind myself of every day and I still do a terrible job of following it because my calendar is just full of obligations that I said yes to because it was like oh this thing seems reasonable, why not someone's asking me for this? I'll just say yes to it. Whereas I'm trying really hard to switch more to a unless I have a hell yeah response to this thing it's going to be a no and I'll say to the person look I'm really sorry it's really busy right now I can't commit to this but I really really suck at this but I'm trying to get better at it. Alright next we have rule number four and we'll cut to Casey and I start talking about this. Last week I talked about that Voltaire quote perfection is the enemy of good. What that means is you can never let your desire for perfection prevent you from finishing something that's good because to finish something even imperfectly is to learn from it and then you can move on and get closer to perfection. Honestly this thing about perfection is like the biggest issue that's holding so many people back uh hold me back as well in in in multiple ways. But especially when I when I teach my course the part-time youtuber academy we've taught like a thousand plus students now to start and grow the youtube channels and like 80% of them plus have suffered from this perfection thing where it's like oh I have to get the perfect camera set up I have to get the light set up I have to get the perfect microphone otherwise I'm not gonna upload a video and the thing I always try and tell them is that no you can't let perfect be the enemy of good just upload the god damn video because if you upload the video and just do more and more and more of it you'll learn from that and eventually you'll be able to move towards perfection and like good enough or whatever whereas if you have that requirement from the get go that this thing has to be perfect it has to be I don't know of our video or whatever you just never ever gonna make anything and this is advice I need often need to tell to myself when it comes to writing my book in my mind I'm thinking oh this needs to be a New York Times best set out therefore every word I write has to be perfection and that just stops me from doing any writing at all and so when I stop thinking about that and instead think you know what I'm just gonna get something messy on the page and I'll worry about it later that's the that's the time when I actually make progress in writing all right rule number five is one that I still follow to this day which is that I am not allowed to watch TV unless it's with other people and this is one very very simple rule slash mental model slash principal that I've had in my life since my university days and it has sort of freed up so much of my time to do other things that I've got on value out of and then sometimes think you know I've missed out on a few TV shows because I don't do the thing I'm watching TV in in my spare time by myself then I think well I'm really glad I missed out on this TV shows because I was able to do better things things that I enjoyed more of things that I personally found more meaningful now for you if you find a lot of meaning and joy and fulfillment from watching TV by yourself that's totally cool you do you for me personally I realise that I don't get a lot of meaning joy fulfilment out of watching TV by myself I get a lot of joy out of watching TV with other people it becomes a social activity watching a TV show by myself just a bit dead I'd rather I don't hang out with friends or place something on the piano or learn something on the guitar or read a book or play on the PlayStation you know I'm cool with playing PlayStation these days but just that that one rule I still have it as a rule not allowed to watch TV by myself and it just frees up so much time in my life to do other things rule number six is the go first rule and this rule states that everyone in the world is friendly but you have to go first and I think about this whenever I'm in a new situation where you know I'm surrounded by strangers I need to talk to people and I always think you know that that anxiety within me of like oh I don't know a fear of rejection if you're of being aware the fear of like oh I don't want to be the first person to say hello because what if they think I'm weird and stuff and I was remind myself no the go first rule is that everyone is friendly but you always have to go first in 100% of situations where I have taken that first step in saying hello to someone or like trying to start some banter or like asking someone out in 100% of cases I've been glad that I've done the thing it hasn't always worked out well but I've always been glad that I've done the thing and so now I try and live by this go first principle all right rule number seven is the Pareto principle and now let's hear from Tim Ferriss I apply the 80 20 principle to everything and the 80 20 principle in brief means that 20% of your actions or inputs or products or sherbs is will create 80% of what you want whatever that happens to be so if I have 10 products and those 10 products are taking up all of my time working 100 hour weeks so let's say 100 products that are creating 100 hour weeks chances are if I didn't announce this I'll find out that 20 of those products are producing 90% of my profits which means I could cut out 80% of my products just get rid of them pull the trigger get rid of them make 90% of what I'm making now and work 20 hours a week I do that for everything again this is something I think about a lot as well like what are the 20% of things that are leading to 80% of the outcomes and I applied this rule the other day I read a Marie Condos the life changing magic of tiny nub and decided to minimify my wardrobe and realized of course that I actually only really wear 20% of the stuff in my wardrobe and so I just donated the other 80% I had like 24 keyboards in the house and I realized I used two of them so I donated the other 22 keyboards to a charity shop so I just doing this sort of 80 20 analysis in everything in life. Rule number 8 is the right-off principle now this is a rule that I came up with for myself and it's basically a way of helping me feel less guilty about like taking time off because now I've got a rule and it's like okay this is going to be a right-off day I'm going to write the day off and then I can relax and like play ratcheting plant for the PlayStation or to the vegetator or order some like crappy takeaway I can do all of that stuff guilt free and on the few occasions that I do this I do this like maybe two or three days a month I always feel that like yes I've got that reset now and I also often feel that okay this day was fun but I actually want to do this every day I wouldn't want every day to be a video games and eating crappy food day because I get a lot of value and joy and fulfillment out of like the work and doing YouTube videos and running the business and all this sort of stuff and so having those few days in the month or I'm just completely vegetate and turn off helps me be more productive in the rest of the time but you know it also adds to my kind of fulfillment and joy and meaning that I get out of life. Rule number 9 is journey before destination something I always talk about it's a quote from Brandon Sanderson's amazing series to storm like archive one of the ideals of tonight's radiant is life before death strength before weakness a journey before destination and I really always think about journey before destination like basically we're basically everything in life it just is about the journey it's not about the destination like setting a goal the goal of writing a writing a book the goal of hitting a best set of list the goal of starting a YouTube channel the goal of hitting subscriber count the goal of getting six pack abs it's not actually about the destination like the goal is kind of a relevant if you hit the goal it's like great I hit the goal you celebrate for five seconds and then you move on moving on to the next thing whereas it's actually all about the journey because the journey is where we spend 100% of our time and so my whole thing is that every single day I'll try my best to enjoy the journey rather than being fixated on the destination I think having a destination is important because without a destination without like a goal to point towards it's hard to like set off on a journey when you don't know where you're going but once you know where you're going at that point you can forget about the goal forget about the destination and just focus on the journey it's the climb remember to have fun remember to enjoy yourself remember to enjoy every day on its own merit because the journey is all that we have wow I really sound like one of those fortune fortune cookie type things but yeah genuinely genuinely life changing principle journey before destination all right rule number 10 is a line from a book by Marie folio hey mom how do you know how to do so many different things that you've never done before but nobody's showing you how to do it and she put down her screwdriver she cocked her head to the side and she looked at me and she said, wait what are you talking about snow big deal? nothing in life is that complicated if you roll up your sleeves you get in there and you do it everything is figure outable and I was like whoa that phrase was cool and it washed over me and it planted a seed in my soul that I swear to you has been the most powerful driving force in my life ever since nothing in life is that complicated everything is figure outable that's just like a really nice way of living life and I often get questions on Instagram from you be like oh how do you play the guitar and piano and how are you so cool how do you do all this kind of stuff how you so handsome how you so charismatic etc etc and I should just you know just have a snippet being like you know nothing in life is that complicated everything is figure outable anytime I see someone doing something that that looks really cool I think whoa how could he possibly do that and then sometimes I asked him and I'm like oh yeah it's easy I just did ABCD and he I'm like oh okay that actually doesn't seem too bad any field that we don't have experience in fields like a black box like learning how to code well the hell is learning how to code it it feels like a black box until you actually spend five minutes opening the black box and you realize oh it's actually not too bad I can learn HTML CSS etc etc etc and now I've got a road map to learning how to code and it wasn't as complicated I thought it was I've actually figured it out okay so those were 10 mental models I live by there are actually 13 in total and the other three are in the extended edition of this video which is available on Nebula if you haven't heard Nebula is a streaming platform that's built by me and a bunch of my other creative friends and on Nebula we post ad free versions of all our videos and extended editions of videos and bonus content that wouldn't necessarily work on YouTube and we can post off on Nebula without really worrying about the YouTube algorithm and so in the extended version of this video which is available Nebula this little thing gets taken out and it's replaced with another three mental models and I've got a ton of other exclusive content on Nebula like my workflow series where I deep dive into how I use some of my favorite apps like Notion and Rome and my deep dive snippet series which is like bite-sized wisdom from all the interviews that I've done over the last two years if you want to get access to Nebula the easiest way is to sign up to curiosity stream who are incidentally very kindly sponsoring this video curiosity stream is the world's leading documentary streaming subscription platform and on curiosity stream they've got thousands of really high quality high budget documentaries that you can watch for free with the subscription one documentary that I enjoyed recently is called Inside of Virtuoso's Brain and it's a look at what makes geniuses like Mozart and these people with incredible talents for things like what actually makes that where does that come from so that was pretty cool and because curiosity stream are really cool and they love independent creators they've actually partnered up with Nebula and so there's a bundle deal whereby if you sign up to curiosity stream which is less than $15 for the whole year you get access to their incredible library of documentaries but you also get free access to Nebula bundled with that and so if less than $15 a year you get these incredible documentaries and you also get all of our stuff on Nebula all of the bonus content all of the ad free stuff early access to videos that whole jazz if that sounds up your street and I think it should cause it's the best deal in the streaming world and head over to curiositystream.com forward slash early and if you sign up on there you'll get your Nebula login details emailed to you.
