## Transcript
 In this video, I'm going to talk through some of my favorite books of 2020, so we're going to go with 10 non-fiction books and 5 fiction books slash series. Let's get started. First on the list, we have a million miles in a thousand years by Donald Miller. Now, this is a really, really good book that made me cry in lots of places and also made me reconsider how I'm living my life. It's about this dude who is a writer and a Hollywood film crew comes up to him one day and they want to convert his life into a film. And then in the process of him relieving his life story and trying to figure out how we can become a film, he kind of realizes that the life he's been living is not particularly storyworthy, like there's not much of a story behind it and he comes to this realization because he realizes that the life he's led has actually been pretty easy and he hasn't had any particularly difficult goals that he was striving towards and didn't need to overcome any conflict along the way together because the things that make a good story are a character that really wants something and it overcomes conflict to get it and he realized that that is also what makes a good life story. So when I read this, it was in the middle of the whole coronavirus lockdown thing in the UK and I remember I was reading it on an evening shift at work, I was at work at the hospital until midnight and there were like three hours at the end of the day after 9pm where we just happened not to have any patients so I just sat in the doctor's office and I just started reading this and I was just completely absorbed in it and it was so so good and I highlighted so much of it and I really started to think that in my own life maybe I'm living too comfortably and the things that I'm going after aren't challenging or aren't challenging enough or there's not enough of a struggle and yeah the lessons I've learned from this book is not like a self-helpy type book or like a personal development book it's just like the story of this dude who is life was becoming a story and it's like really well written and very engaging and it's like a really good story but it also has a lot of interesting lessons along the way here's a nice quote from the book Somehow we realize that great stories are told in conflict but we are unwilling to embrace the potential greatness of the story we're actually in we think God is unjust rather than a master storyteller Next on the list we have how to think more about sex by Alanne de Botton and I listened to this on Audible over the course of like two car journeys and it was really really engaging and also very entertaining and insightful in lots of different parts and I find it hard to put this into words myself so I'm just going to read the excerpt which is in this rigorous and supremely honest book Alanne de Botton helps us navigate the intimate and exciting yet often confusing and difficult experience that is sex few of us tend to feel we're entirely normal when it comes to sex and what we're supposed to be feeling rarely matches up with the reality this book argues that 21st century sex is ultimately faded to be a balancing act between love and desire and adventure and commitment Now on the surface this is a book about sex but actually deeper like a level deeper it's about so much more and it's about like the human connection and it's about like authenticity and vulnerability and all these cool things and honestly I think this should be required reading for everyone like this is going to be on on my list of everyone should read this book books that I'm compiling at some point by the way if you want to keep up to date with all of the books that I'm reading you should definitely sign up to my email newsletter which will be linked in the video description basically every time I read a book in 2021 I'm going to write a quick summary of it and I'll send out an email so if you're interested in getting insights from books in your inbox for free sign up to the newsletter link in the video description third on the list is the righteous mind by Jonathan Hight and the subtitle here is why good people are divided by politics and religion now this was really really really really interesting because the way that he he kind of explains our moral intuitions by talking about six different moral taste receptors and this was really interesting because as a staunch liberal and lefty myself I'd never quite been able to appreciate why some people are conservative slash right wing and all that kind of stuff but the way that he talks about it is as if we all have these six different moral taste buds and different and sort of if you're a liberal versus if you're a conservative or if you're versus if you're somewhere along that spectrum you respond to these different moral taste buds in different ways and he explains that through his research and stuff if you are like me a liberal then you care very strongly about like two or three of these moral taste buds whereas in general if you're a conservative you care somewhat equally about all six of those and that actually goes like for me went a very long way towards explaining like just just being able to understand more about how people on the other side of the political spectrum how their views were shaped by what they believed was moral Next on the list we have the psychology of money by Morgan Housel as you guys know money is one of my favorite topics and in this book he talks about how actually the way that we as humans treat money is not very rational and in fact you know based a lot on emotions and a lot on psychology and for me in the past I'd always wanted to take a more kind of rational stance towards money and economic so for example something like you know paying off the mortgage on your own house is generally not rational because you could get higher returns in the stock market if you continue to have a mortgage but as Morgan Housel argues very well in the book it is even though paying off your mortgage is not rational it's not the economically rational thing to do it is in fact very reasonable because it helps you sleep at night and that was just like one of the sort of doesn't different insights and I'm going to be doing a separate video specifically about that book that will be linked up there when it's out but it just really changed my view of money like saving and investing and salaries and also stuff about like greed and ambition when it comes to money because he tells a lot of stories of people who seemingly had loads of loads of money and then through it all the way or by doing illegal things and the pursuit of more money and there's all these sorts of cautionary tales that I'm now starting to become a lot more interested in because it's just so interesting like this money thing is the thing that binds all of us together wherever we live stress about money is like one of the fundamentals of the human existence or of the human experience and just being able to understand a little bit more about it was yeah, eye opening and nice Next we have the book Storyworthy by Matthew Dicks which I think is probably the single best book nonfiction book I've read all year and as I was reading it I was taking notes and kind of doing candle highlights and stuff and I was saying I was saying to myself damn this is one of the best and most engaging books I've ever read and it's a book about storytelling it's about how to become a better story teller but it's a lot more than just about storytelling and in fact he talks about how becoming a better storyteller is actually a way of becoming a better listener to become a better partner or spout so brother or sister or husband or wife like but a storytelling permeates so many different aspects of our lives that and it's a skill that most of us don't bother trying to improve or to even realise that you can improve it and it's only really been this year that I've realised that I need to improve my own storytelling and that I can and this book is one of the things that's really helped in that way there's also a really good exercise in it that he calls homework for life which is the idea that every night you spend five minutes just going over your day reflecting on your day and writing a few words to describe the most story worthy moment of your day and I've been doing this for about three months solidly when I read the book and it made such a sort of tangible difference to my life not just in the sense that I could then tell more interesting stories because I had these written down but actually now that I look back through my spreadsheet on notion where I was like tracking my story worthy moments of each day I can remember those few months between like May and July I can remember those months a lot better than I can remember the last three months for example where I've not been doing it when you do that it's like oh yeah I remember that day I remember that day I remember that moment that was nice and in a way it slows down the passage of time whereas for the last three months where I haven't been doing this homework for life and not been really reflecting on my day and writing things down you know if you asked me what I did last week or the week before I wouldn't be able to tell you I just be like I don't know the time just sort of blended into itself I guess I was sitting at home not going out sitting in front of the computer making videos but that's like about it and so moving forward I really want to keep on trying to do this homework for life every night because I know it'll help me become a better storyteller and therefore better conversationalist and therefore better social skills across the board but more importantly it'll help me you know experience life and enjoy life a little bit more fully The final five non-fiction books I'm just going to blitz through because I can't be bothered to talk about them and blink in the video description sign up to my email newsletter I always send emails about this stuff as I read it anyway The first one is how to take smart notes by Sunky Orange which is all about how to take notes when reading and it was really, really good and I enjoyed it a lot Next we have the ride of a lifetime which is the autobiography slash biography of Bob Eiger who was the CEO of the Walt Disney company for 15 years and that was really interesting was all about like you know his life and how he got started and how he became CEO and how he acquired like Marvel and Fox and Lucasfilm and these really interesting stories then there was the elephant in the brain which I've done an episode of book club about that'll be linked over there that's all about the hidden motives in our everyday lives and about how actually a lot of the behaviors that we have as humans are about signaling and about status and about just trying to play status games with other people and I was definitely like that definitely made me reflect a lot about what my own motivations were for doing things like this YouTube channel and running a business and even being a doctor and stuff like to what extent is this all just signaling Number nine we have a book called or doctor by David Notz who is a vascular surgeon based in London and who has been in loads and loads of different war zones over the last like 30 years doing like war, documentary, type, surgeries and things and that was so good it's like a really engaging and thrilling story and you hear about how his experiences of being a surgeon on the front lines were not quite the front lines but a surgeon in the hospitals in places like Syria and Libya and other like war zone type places that was really fantastic recommend reading for everyone and finally I really enjoyed a book called natives by a collar which is all about like the interplay between race and class in modern day Britain I listened to that on audible and it was narrated by a collar himself and it's like a spoken word type guy so he's like really good at like audio narration so it was very engaging from that sense but also just gave me a pretty profound insight into things like what it's like to be black in Britain what it's like to be working class in Britain because these are experiences that I don't have and it really helped shape my view of the world there's so much more to say about it but link in the video description if you want to grab a book so those were ten non-fiction books let's now talk about my five favourite fiction reads of 2020 and we have to start with the series called The Wheel of Time by Robert Jordan which was then finished the final three books by my favourite author of all time Brandon Sanderson now the Wheel of Time series has 14 books and I've been reading them since mid 2019 and I finished them in March 2020 April 2020 something like that and it's really, really, really good it's hard to describe what a like 14 book fantasy series is about but it's sort of like these three boys are in some tiny ass village and then like a wizard comes and tells them that they're like the chosen ones and the dark lord is after them and stuff and then they go on an adventure and that sounds super, super lame but it's actually so good and I thought the last like four or five books in particular were just absolute masterpieces and I would look forward to driving to work each day and back because I could just listen to more wheel of time it was so, so good if you're new to the fantasy genre which is a genre that I've been sort of engaged in since like 2017 if you're new to it I wouldn't start with the wheel of time the wheel of time is a little bit slow and quite long so you kind of need to be a bit more versed in fantasy and being able to sit through large amounts of description and stuff to really appreciate it but missed born by Brandon Sanderson that is the series you should start with secondly is a two book series by Lee Bardugo called Six of Crows again this is fantasy I read a lot of fan in fact I think every, oh no four or four out of the five books in this list are fantasy fantasy just like the best genre Six of Crows it's about this gang of thieves in like the slums of a city and they each have their own like sort of specialist skills like one of the main characters is the boss of like this gang of thieves and the other main characters like really like a gymnast so she can like you know scale walls and sneak into places and what's it about? They're basically trying to break in to like a super super super heavily guarded fortress to rescue a scientist who has discovered some like formula that creates this drug that is going to completely take over the world and there's like a bit of magic and there's like a bit of romance it's got it all and the two books in the series are actually like very short and it's very sort of nicely packaged and it ends in like a nice way I read Six of Crows one and two straight after finishing the wheel of time when I had a hole in my heart it temporarily plugged to that hole that was left in my heart after I finished the wheel of time but we have another book by Brandon Sanderson called Elantris this is one of his standalone novels again really good it's one of his earlier books so it's a little bit of a slower pace than his more modern stuff to an extent but it was also really good and I was up until like four o'clock in the morning for about three nights in a row just like reading it because it was sick oh yeah what's it about it's another fantasy it's always really lame describing fantasy books but basically there is like the city called Elantris which ten years ago used to be like a superpower and they had people who could do magic and stuff but then something dark and evil happened and then the city became like you know decrepit and desolate wasteland and it follows the story of like three different characters and how one of them ends up in the city and ends up become you know starts off as like a prince and then ends up becoming just like a random kind of safe slash slash servant in the city and the person that he's due to Mary so he's the on sale rocks up to his city and finds that he's actually dead and it's sort of very complicated but like the sunset they want to say but trust me it's really really really good you should read Elantris by Brandon Sanderson next I really enjoyed the book normal people by who's Sally Rooney which was apparently really released in 2018 there was actually a TV series about it I haven't seen the TV series but the book was really good and I think I read it in I read it in one sitting like I just started reading it one evening I just continued to read it until like five in the morning this book about it follows two teenagers Connell and Marianne and Connell is like a super popular dude in high school and Marianne is like super nerdy on popular in high school and Connell and Marianne I get together but Connell like because he's the popular sports guy he doesn't tell anyone about it and he's like mean to her and stuff when they both go to university they end up at the same university Marianne becomes like popular and pretty and then Connell start struggles to fit in and so it's like their love story which is sort of intertwined and there's all loads of like trauma and mental health and insecurities and it's really interesting and it was a very it was an interesting insight into the human experience in a way that I just not quite appreciated before so yeah would recommend this isn't really a book this is actually I think it's like an audible original it's like specifically designed as an audio program it's called the original and it's by Brandon Sanderson favorite fantasy author again and Mary Cole and this is just like it's like it lasts a few hours I think it's only like four or five hours and it's like a book but it's like specifically for audio and so there's like background music and sound effects and things as the narrators are narrating it and this isn't quite fantasy it's more like science fiction it sort of set in the future in a world where you know people can get cloned and so the story goes that there is this woman who ends up murdering her husband and the government decides to clone the woman and gives the clone like you know this artificial intelligence kind of being in every way gives her like martial arts skills like powers kick people's asses and stuff and her job is to track down the original like the original person and to kill her and then take over her life and again that probably sounds lame but it's really good I remember so I was visiting Oxford with a friend three-hour drive each direction from Cambridge to an hour something like that like the drive was so good because my friend and I was listening to the original all the way there and all the way back and it was absolutely incredible so that would be my final recommendation linked in the video description so those were non-fiction and five-fiction books that I enjoyed in 2020 again if you like the stuff then definitely check out my email newsletter because every time I read a book I would I email out a summary of the book and like a link to it if you want to check it out thanks for watching if you like this video check out this video over here which is about the three books that most change my life thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next video bye bye
