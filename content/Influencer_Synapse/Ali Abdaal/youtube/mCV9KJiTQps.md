In this video, we're looking at how small changes to our physical and digital environments can help boost our productivity without using apps but instead through leveraging the power of friction - the most powerful force in the universe*. This was one of the ideas inspired by Atomic Habits by James clear - you can find my book club episode on Atomic Habits below.

## Transcript
 We don't often think about the physical environment that we live and work in, but it's probably something we should pay more attention to. As James Claire says in atomic habits, environment is the invisible hand that shapes human behavior. And although our internal motivation and discipline is important, ultimately it's the environment that surrounds us, that most determines whether we'll find it easy or hard to build and maintain the habit that'll help us live happier, healthier, more productive lives. Hey friends, welcome back to the channel. If you knew here, my name is Ali, I'm a doctor working in the UK, and today we're talking about environment design. Because whether we're at home or at school or at work, the physical environment around us has such a ridiculously big impact on so many different things. But intuitively, we think that if we want to be more productive, or we want to build a healthy habit, like eating healthy legal, playing a musical instrument, or in my case, trying to get henched like Zac Efron. Intrusively, we sort of think that we need more motivation or discipline. But actually, there's an easier way to do all of those things, and it's all about the power of friction. I've got this pet theory that is entirely non-scientific, but I think works reasonably well if you want to be a productivity grease monkey, and that is that friction is the most powerful force in the universe. And unsurprisingly, environment design is one of the best ways to leverage its power. So we can think of friction as the force of resistance in the gap between intention and action. Like the intention is, I should practice the guitar, and the action is actually practicing the guitar. But in between that, we've got this friction and friction is what causes all of the problems. So overall, if we want to encourage good habits, we should reduce friction, and if we want to discourage bad habits, we should increase friction. So that's kind of the basic premise of environment design. It's all really about increasing or decreasing friction in intentional ways. And for me, the biggest way that I've done that in my life is sleep. So back in the day, I used to make the terrible mistake of taking my phone into bed with me. I would lie awake for hours staring at the screen, browsing Instagram or watching random YouTube videos, or, once in a blue moon, maybe even replying to a message on Tinder. But then, once I discovered some of this environment design stuff, by reading atomic habits, and by reading Matthew Walker's Why We Sleep, which is a very good book. I decided to start putting my phone across the room for me so that I physically couldn't reach it. And then suddenly, like magic, I started sleeping better because, you know, I wasn't a wasting time on my phone before bed, and I didn't have this kind of blue light screen glaring up at my eyes. These days, when I sleep, the only thing I have next to me is my Kindle Paper White are on the bedside table, and I have the brightness turned down for like 1%. I've also organized my iPhone around this principle of friction. On the very first screen, the only apps that I've got are the useful ones, the ones that I would actually want to click on if I open my phone. I have to go all the way to the second screen if I want, you know, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, Tinder, Bumble, Hinge, all of that stuff. And so, when I unlock my phone, the first thing I see on screen is not the screen that has all the notifications on it, it's the screen that has useful apps like, notion and drafts and castro and audible, and key, and, you know, apps that I actually want to be using, rather than the infinity pools that I know I'm just going to get distracted with. Thirdly, this environment design stuff has been really helpful for me in the realm of music. So, I've been dabbling with the guitar for the last few years, but I want to make a concerted effort to get better at it. But before the problem used to be that the guitar would be all the way across the room, like, this is not a very big living room, it's just an apartment, but it would be like on the other side of the room, and that was just, even it just being on the other side of the room was just too much friction. And so, after kind of rereading a topic habits for my book club video linked in the video description and stuff, after rereading the book, I realised actually, I could just take my guitar and now I have it stationed on the sofa, like literally leaning on the sofa, so that if I am, you know, in an unproductive slump and I go sit on the sofa, instead of taking out my phone and then browsing Twitter doing something like that, it's just as easy for me to pick up the guitar and start doing a little bit of practice. So, just that slight reduction of friction by moving the default position of the guitar has meant that I'm, I practice guitar for like half an hour a day for the last few weeks, ever since I started doing that, and it was just that one small change that made the difference. Alternatively, if I do end up in a slump on the sofa, one of the apps I have on my phone is something that helps me get out of that slump, and that is brilliant, who are kind of sponsoring this video. If you haven't heard, brilliant is a fantastic platform for maths, science, and computer science courses, and they've got tons and tons of these across loads of different subjects, which are all very interactive. So, it's not like you're just sort of like watching a video kind of like this one. It's like you're actually interacting with the stuff, you're getting problems along the way. And the courses that I'm kind of going through these days are the computer science series, so they've got the introduction to computer science, the fondamentals of algorithms, they've got some really good stuff on neural networks and machine learning as well. And even though I taught myself to code when I was very young, I'd never quite understood the fundamentals of computer science. And I find that for me, if I am in a bit of a slump, I'll make myself a cup of tea or a cup of coffee, and I will sit on the sofa and just do for 15 or 20 minutes, one of the online courses I'm brilliant, because it exercises my mind, it gets me out of the slump, it's really cool.

So, yeah, when we internalize this idea, that friction is the most powerful force in the universe. We can then use it to our advantage to build good habits and break bad ones. And that is what this book by James Clear atomic Habits is all about. You should read it. If you can't be bothered to read it, then check out the video linked over here, which is my book club summary and discussion of the highlights from this book. You should check it out. Thanks for watching. See you in the next video. Bye.
