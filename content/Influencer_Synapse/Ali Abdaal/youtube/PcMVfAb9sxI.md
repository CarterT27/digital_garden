## Transcript
 Hey guys, welcome back to the vlog and to get another study with me. As usual, I'm gonna take you through my day of what I did when I was preparing for my exam And hopefully kind of share a few bits and bobs tips and tricks along the way. So this happened a few weeks ago, and I was getting a bit bored of just kind of Revising in my room. So I decided to change it off a bit by heading down towards the clinical school library It's only about a five minutes skateboard ride from me, and this is a good general tip that I find helpful like changing up the atmosphere Makes a lot more manageable Especially when like being in the same place can get quite tedious a lot of the time the official study day started at about noon I can't remember what I was doing in the morning. It's probably like washing some YouTube videos maybe editing a video But from noon onwards I decided that I needed to learn how to examine someone's testicles and how to examine someone with pan-hypo-pituatorism Which is a sort of disease of the pituitary gland where you're not producing any of the hormones So as I was reviewing these topics, I started off with active recall obviously like asking myself What do I know about this topic if I were asked this in an exam or what would I say and I realized that actually I didn't know much about the testicular exam or about pan-hypo-pituatorism So then I reviewed the notes on it. These weren't my own notes I didn't waste time making my own notes on this because especially with clinical medicine and most of the subject There are so many useful resources online in from people in the year above so the notes that I was using was made by a medic from like 2010 That all of the clinical medics use so there's really no point in us making your own notes about these examinations In fact the only scenario in which I do make my own notes is a if there is no easily accessible summary of information But another thing I find useful to actually write down is a nemonics because I absolutely love nemonics and Any time I need to like learn a list I try and figure out a way of making a funny nemonic out of it And secondly, I write things down in order to categorize things So let's say I'm looking at the causes of anemia and I just see like a long list or I see a textbook categorized in different kind of chapters or in different sort of subsections I would kind of write down anemia in the middle of a page and like do a spider diagram so I can categorize the causes of anemia That's sort of thing so going back to the testicular exam and the pituatory examination after And of reviewing the topic making a couple of notes to like four minimmonic in my head I wrote questions into my active recall spreadsheet that I knew I was gonna review after lunch time Just to get a bit of active recall and space repetition in there throughout this day of studying I was using an app called forest to manage my time Forest as an app that's kind of lets you plant trees on your phone and the trees take 25 minutes to grow and If you use your phone or go away from the app at any point during that time then the tree dies So it's a good kind of regimented way to use the pumador method which is 25 minutes of work followed by five minutes of rest To be honest, I don't really use the pumador method a lot of the time But I do find it sometimes helpful. I find in a library on my own and I want something to make my revision a little bit more of a game Then I use something like forest to you know make myself do the pumador method So I've got this kind of game that I'm playing with myself around like right I'm gonna study for 25 minutes and then I've got my break I'm gonna study for 25 minutes and I've got my break It just makes it a bit more fun In one of my forest breaks I went downstairs to the clinical school cafe to grab a latte for about ¬£2.50 I used to feel guilty about this and I still can't have due to an extent But I think especially in exam term when we're preparing for our exams I think it's totally worth it to spend that ¬£2.50 just to increase my happiness and then increase my enjoyment just a little bit I think that's a good use of money personally Anyway, let's get back to studying so from 124 to about 151 I went over dermatology, dermatology, uh, study of the skin. It's quite a visual subject So instead of like going over my notes or whatever I found some quizzes on like a dermatology website online and kind of just went through the quiz and As I found areas that I wasn't comfortable with I filled those holes and this is another general point It's it's important to like change up your study techniques depending on what subject you're actually doing And I know this sounds obvious, but I've been getting the other messages from Instagram from people being like How do I apply your active recall spreadsheet to like maths or physics or engineering and the answer is you probably don't because maths physics engineering A lot of these like the best way to revise for those from what I've heard is by doing practice sheets and problems and a past papers and all that kind of stuff And there's no need to shoehorn your revision for a particular subject into a technique someone else is using Just a general comment tailor your revision techniques to whatever subjects specifically that you're advising for as I was doing the quiz I came across a few conditions that I wasn't quite comfortable with the important thing here is that instead of just looking it up Like I might have to be intended to do in the past. I decided to practice what I preach and before looking anything up I would actively try and retrieve that knowledge from my brain So for example, what is the management of acne? How do we treat acne? I know that I know this and I know I have come across it many times before But I just wasn't quite sure so before looking it up I asked myself the question I kind of pretended like I was in an exam and tried to answer it in my head How would I answer that question if an examiner asked me what's the treatment faculty? I came up with something and then Looked it up and then kind of refined the answer that I came up with and I think that's a better strategy than just looking it up because again We're engaging in active recall and we know that active recall is a way of life I also made a few notes for dermatology and now like I get asked about this all the time these days. This whole thing about making notes As I said earlier, I think notes are really helpful if there is no preexisting summary of the content available Which I think is usually quite rare I think notes useful if you're making the monarchs or if you're categorizing things in like nice colors so that you can visually get an Idea of what the syllabus is so if I am coming across a new topic I have absolutely no columns about making a quick document or no debility, which is the app I use from my iPad and And kind of writing brief notes about it. Maybe including a picture maybe including a spider diagram However, every time I do make notes, I do have in the back of my mind that right I know I shouldn't be falling into this Trap of thinking that making notes is inherently productive Because previously back in the day when doing like GCCs and A levels I kind of used to have this mindset of oh I'm being so productive because I'm making notes But now anytime I'm making notes, I have in the back of my mind right this is probably suboptimal I should be actively Using these notes order to learn the stuff rather than doing the notes just for the sake of doing this and again to reiterate This is very kind of person specific like if you think that you learn best by making notes and you're getting the results more importantly Then by all means please continue to make notes. Don't let me rain on your parade If however you are spending hours and hours making notes and you're not really getting the results that you want Then maybe consider that making notes is probably not the most optimum strategy for like efficiently Revising for your exams pretty much just do whatever works for you And it's and what works for you kind of depends on how you feel about it and how you feel about the results that you're getting in my opinion Okay, getting back to the day again. So from 237 for about 15 minutes I worked on the stoma examination now a stoma is like a bag that comes out of your colon and like is flush against your skin For people who have had like surgery on their colon or who have had their colon removed Anyway, we have to learn how to examine one of these so like if you see one in real life like what do you have to say about it? What do you have to feel about it? What are you looking for? So I worked on the stoma examination for about 15 minutes I probably could have spent much longer on it But at this point I felt that prioritizing breadth was more important than going deep on any specific topic And this is a really important thing that we all learn in medicine at some point that there's just so much that you could learn That at some point you have to decide you know what I don't care about this level of detail and onwards I'm just gonna focus on getting the big picture and I think with any other subject as well It's really important to get the big picture first before worrying about the details and mistake that a lot of people make Especially with stuff like chemistry where there is quite a lot of detail or biology where again You can go into quite a lot of detail is that you know, they would focus on trying to get really good at one topic And then really good at another topic and then really good at the third topic Whereas I think a better way maybe of doing it what works for me anyway is to become vaguely familiar with everything And then kind of start digging the detail down a bit more each time So the storm examination took us to about 251 and then I spent eight minutes looking over how to examine someone's rectum Admittedly I've done this in real life quite a few times I sometimes volunteer for it in the hospitals or in the GP practice when anyone asks I think it's You know, it's it's a good learning experience So most of it I kind of already knew I kind of ran through in my head what I would do if I were examining someone's rectum At about three p.m. I decided to have lunch I'd spent the last three hours from 12 to three working on the examinations that I was weakest on and By this point this was I think about four days before our exam There was no topic that I was thinking that would be really really bad if it came up So I covered most of the holes to a reasonable amount of detail So the next question in terms of what I was going to do next was asking myself Which topics am I not 100% confident in so just a kind of like the threshold for what we revised kind of changes as as we get closely closer to the exam Hopefully we become we become more familiar with the content therefore You know instead of being like okay if this came up I would fail It becomes more of a okay if this came up I probably only get 60% rather than 80% Let me focus on that topic to try and get those extra 20%. So I grabbed lunch from Costa and spent the next two hours Using forest using the Pomodoro method and going over the hip examination the knee examination the shoulder examination and in my forest five minute breaks I was replying to YouTube comments and Instagram DMs Follow me on Instagram and subscribe my YouTube channel please Sometimes I'd spend longer than 25 minutes doing something especially if I was like in the flow and I forgot to check forest That's kind of the thing about the Pomodoro method. It's useful as a crutch to help if You find that you're a kind of losing productivity and losing concentration, but I think if you are in kind of in the zone Then there's no need to stick to it in a regimented fashion It's completely okay to do 30 minutes 35 minutes as long as you're still kind of in the zone still focused So now we're at 5 p.m. and I attended an lecture for an hour given by students from the oncology society Which was a really good kind of revision of cancer stuff It wasn't really stuff that was gonna come up in my exam, but I tended to lecture anyway because one of my friends was giving it and just Just to see what it's like and just generally it's quite useful to get revision of stuff even if we know we're not gonna be examined on it Because this is the kind of stuff that's important in real life as doctors I mean just just from experiencing supervising other students I think that the student supervisor is a better for preparing you for an exam If you want to be pushed in a very small specific domain and have like really intellectual debate to have your professor Then having a professor to supervise and it's probably better But if you want to do well in your exams By far in a way you do much better if you have a student supervisor I think Pretty much whatever level of education you're at But this kind of moral applies to a level that's university and beyond if you can arrange to give a lecture a revision lecture about a topic that you're doing yourself to your peers Or to people here younger than you that just massively consolidates your own on your own understanding of the topic because in order to teach something You really have to know it well and having that Almost deadline of being judged by your peers for delivering a hopefully decent teaching session That's a really great way of forcing yourself to learn stuff So when we run supervisions on weekends I often arrange to supervise a topic that I know I'm on familiar with because it forces me to spend hours and hours preparing the lecture in advance So yeah, this is a little tip there. The run 6pm. We went home Cooked some tuna pasta pesto with veg and then for the rest of the evening We had a fairly chill sort of group revision session in my room a bit of chatting a bit of doing a bit of work And it was quite a relaxed ending to the day where we were all low key doing a bit of revision But doing it in a group so that we all enjoyed it a bit more and had a nice time with it For things like biology, I found that doing the exam questions You had to kind of be able to answer the questions so you even if you knew all the knowledge There were certain ways of answering the questions certain buzzwords that answers schemes we're looking for So I would actually say even though it's tempting to just go through your textbook do exam papers and Revise from those. I completely agree with that point as well It's all very well and good doing active recall and free active recall and writing out everything you know about a chapter But when you've got your exam in two or three weeks that that is totally pointless because that's not going to get you any marks in the exam What's going to get you marks in the exam is by effectively memorizing the mark schemes So doing loads of practice papers actually doing them first and then looking at the mark schemes and seeing if you can learn learn What sort of buzzwords enzyme substrate complex? Yeah, you know complementary all all of this and that that You probably know but that you just need to like memorize the mark scheme in order to put them into your answers So there were some some six markers where actually all you need to have were six words and even if you knew all the theory about Inzymes and digestion. It was just those six words or those six phrases that you needed to get the marks so you need to learn those marks schemes I think a good thing to think is that the markers the the examiner is in GCC and A level are like really really dumb They're just going to follow the mark scheme to the letter because they've got like a zillion papers to mark and It's pretty unfeasible for ediccelerate qi or whoever to hire like you know university professors in biology to mark your biology papers So most likely it'll be marked by or hopefully a biology teacher Maybe even a random person who hasn't studied biology. They'll be looking at the mark scheme It'd be looking specifically for you to nail those points. I should have said you do kind of have to Have to get the buzzwords the buzzwords as well as all about so that brings us to the end of this vlog It was pretty productive day I spent about six hours in the clinical school library bashing through the examinations that I had left to do before my exam And spent the rest of the time having a relaxed evening with friends So thank you very much for watching. I hope you enjoyed the video if you liked it Please give it a thumbs up if you haven't subscribed to the channel. Please consider doing so have a lovely day Good luck with your revision and I'll see you in the next video. Bye
