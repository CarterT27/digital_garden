## Transcript
 Hey guys, welcome back to the channel. If you're new here, my name is Ali. I'm a junior doctor working in Cambridge, and for a while now It's kind of been a little hobby of mine to pimpe out my desk setup to be as overkill Ella possibly can without spending too much money. So at the moment, it's based around the 15 inch MacBook Pro Which is fairly spectacular because I use it for editing and everything and it's connected to a 34 inch LG ultra wide monitor, but the slightly annoying first forward problem with that is That because the MacBook Pro is USB-C, I have to use one of these Satachi dongle things to connect it by HDMI to that monitor And for a few months now, I've kind of been dreaming about getting a monitor that has USB-C so that I can connect it directly And you know, ultimately work towards this this world where you just have one cable connecting your laptop to the whole death setup Rather than having to plug 10 different things at once. So to that end in this video, I'm going to be unboxing This thing, this is the BenQ ex 35 Oh one zero R and it's a massive 35 inch curved monitor that they sent me a few months ago They were like we like your desk setup videos, would you like to upgrade your monitor and I was like sure And the next thing I knew this bad boy arrived So today because I've got nothing better to do we're gonna unbox it get it set up and hopefully get it working with the MacBook Pro as part of the desk setup as part of the constant drive to innovate and to make the most Overkill desk setup imaginable Another power cable for if you're American so More cables Let's face down Look at that All right, so so far so good. This bad boy's been unboxed But the problem is if I want to have it on my desk this wall mounted 34 inch needs to go away and the problem is I'll show you War mounting of this 34 inch. It's not very good. Yeah, don't if you can see that but if we look around the back of it So it's very it's very shortly done. Yeah, so that's what my wall mounting efforts look like how can we get around this this is the question I could go for a double monitor setup so we could put this one kind of over there With that work or is it too big for that? Let's so let's give it a go. It's your happens Where do you reckon so that actually sort of looks all right doesn't it? Oh my god it works guys it actually works a single USB seat cable connected in between the laptop and and the screen Makes both of them work and the laptop's even charging oh my god. This is absolutely the future What if time to be alive? Here we have it triple monitor setup for now to be honest. I'm probably going to get this one off the wall and this one onto the wall Once I can get some tools in a drill and stuff together and then we'll probably go back to just kind of one over here And want to be here but for now this triple monitor setup is pretty cool. So we can grab something We can bring it down to the laptop take it up into this LG and then across into the bank you monitor oh my god Look at that so here we have it. We've got the triple monitor desk so I hope we've got the 15 inch MacBook Pro Connected to the LG 34 inch ultra wide via HDMI and then connected to this bank you 35 inch ultra wide curved monitor via USB See this is like the first time I've ever used USB C to connect to a monitor and apparently this new monitor has this fancy like 100 Hertz refresh rate which is a great if you play in games. I don't really play games So I don't know I've got this AMD free sync thing which apparently is also quite good if you play in games But I don't play games so probably a bit overkill and apparently this monitors also got this fancy feature whereby it detects the ambient light in the room And adjust the brightness accordingly. So if I'm editing late into the night They'll probably dim the brightness down a little bit so it's not to strain my eyes and if it's a middle of the day It will blurb the brightness really high. So yeah, thanks again. Thank you for sending this over if anyone else fancy sending me some Stuff to pimped this desk out even more. That'll be really awesome. So yeah, thanks for watching this Very frivolous and sort of pointless unboxing video If you liked it please give it a thumbs up if you haven't subscribed to the channel yet please consider doing so have a lovely day And I'll see you in the next one. Goodbye You
