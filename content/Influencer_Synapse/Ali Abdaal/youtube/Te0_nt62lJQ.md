In this video, we're talking about the setup that makes my YouTube videos. We go through the camera, lens and monitor, and the lighting and audio equipment that makes my videos look pretty reasonable in terms of quality (if I do say so myself). I also give a quick tour of my desk and the stuff that's in the background. Enjoy xx

## Transcript
 Hey guys, welcome back to the channel. Today, I'm going to be showing you the gear and the setup behind what makes these YouTube videos. So the lighting, the camera, the audio, all the various things that go into making this, what you're watching, look, hopefully pretty reasonable. Before I start, I just want to say that if you're just getting started on YouTube or thinking you're getting started on YouTube, please don't be intimidated by this sort of setup. When I started YouTube, my first couple of videos will film with just my iPhone, and then I had a cheapish Sony A6000 setup that in total was about $700, and even that is quite a lot of money to spend on camera gear. There are so many YouTubers that are far bigger and far more successful than me who are using setups that cost a fraction of what this stuff you're about to see. Costs having said that, I knew that for my channel when I first got started with YouTube and wanted to take it seriously, I knew that I wanted to invest in production value and invest in quality because I felt like I didn't quite have the personality to just carry content without also having good production value if that makes sense. So that said, let's now get it off the sticks and we'll switch to vlog mode on the Sony A6500, and I'll show you around that behind the scenes of this particular setup, this should be fun. So let's start with the camera. So that over there is the Sony A73, and now I only bought this a few months ago. This is quite an expensive camera, but it's an absolutely incredible full frame camera, and the main lens that I'm using for this is the Sony 24mm F1.4 G Master lens. I really like this particular focal length, because it means I can have the camera just literally an arm's length away from me, and that is sitting on top of the Manfrotto B3 tripod. This is just a standard tripod. It's kind of nice because it's quite lightweight, which means I can travel around with it if I really feel like it. And on top we've got the small HD focus, I think I'll put a link to all the stuff in the description below, and that lets me see myself, because otherwise Sony cameras, unfortunately apart from the A6400 don't have flip out screens, so you kind of need to monitor to see yourself. This is basically the camera lens monitor setup that I can just pick up with a tripod and transport over there to the sofa area, if I want to do a different kind of thing, or I can transport this setup into my bedroom, if I want to film a video on my bed, that sounds a bit weird. So that's the basic setup of how I get these shots. I'm going to talk a little bit more about the light and the audio and the other stuff that goes into this, like camera settings and workflow and things, but before I do I just want to give a massive shout out to this video sponsor, which is Storyblocks video, and Storyblocks video is a fantastic online library of studio quality royalty-free stock video, but also motion backgrounds and after effects templates that you can use in your own video projects. I've had a Storyblocks premium subscription for the last few months, since well before they actually reached out to sponsor me, so I actually used them for my videos, and I've found that their library of stock videos has been quite handy in things like my Sudan medical mission vlog, where I didn't quite have the time to get certain shots, so I kind of cheated and got some stock footage of Storyblocks, but hopefully no one could tell, because it's all about telling the story, it doesn't really matter where you get the footage from, and I also really like the beautiful time lapses that you get on Storyblocks video, and I sometimes use those in my vlogs in my videos to show the passage of time with some nice little time laps of the stars, but you don't have to use it like that. People like Peter McKinnon, amazing YouTuber, what he does is he sometimes gets like high quality sky 4K footage of like crowds and stuff, and overlays that on top of his own footage to make his own footage look better and make it look like it's got a legit sky, so there's all sorts of various uses for stock video, but yeah, if you want to find out more about Storyblocks, you can check out the link in the video description, and thanks again guys for sponsoring this video. Right, so with that said, let's go back to vlog mode, and I'll show you the rest of the setup. Arguably, the most important thing about decent quality videos, people say is decent quality audio, and this is my audio setup. So I've got here the road video mic pro plus, and that is connected via 3.5mm to XLR cable thing to this thing, which is the Zoom H5, which is an external audio recorder that records into an SD card, and it can be battery powered, but sometimes I plug it in, and this is the recorded that me and my brother, or rather my brother and I use to record a podcast as well, so we plug the road pro castes, double XLR input into the Zoom H5, so this one audio recorder has been doing a lot of work for me over the last few months. And all this setup is sitting on top of some random microphone stand that I got off Amazon, and I've got this sort of boomed like setup, like I think proper cinematography is based on boom mics where you have like this big shotgun mic that's kind of being boomed in, i.e. held by those audio people just above the just above the talent. So what I do here is that hopefully in frame, you can't actually see the microphone, but if you'll see where I'm where I'm sitting, it's like literally just, so I'm sitting over there on my piano stool, I've got the iPad in front of me, whereas I've got my script on my video idea, the mic is literally just above my head, so if I were to move the mic down a little bit, you would see it comes in frame, but I keep it just out of frame, because apparently the way to get decent audio quality is to have your mouth as close to the mic as possible, so that is how I get the audio, and then in terms of synchronization, I use an app called plural eyes, which is fantastic, it costs a lot of money, but it saved me many, many days of time over the last two years, so it's fully worth it, and that's where you just drag and drop all your video footage or your audio files or your iPad screen recordings, and it automatically synchronizes everything, so that's a fantastic app for making videos like this. And finally, in terms of lighting, I use this big bad boy. This is the aperture 120D Mark II, combined with the aperture light dome 2 softbox, so the light itself is only about this big, like it's quite small, quite portable, and that's sitting on top of some really cheap stand that I got with my old lighting setup. My old lighting setup was about 30, 40 pounds on Amazon, it was sort of like this, but a lot less nice and not indibible, whereas most of the space in this setup is taken up by this massive softbox, and I think the theory behind lighting is that the bigger your diffusion, the bigger your surface area for light, the more soft that light appears. Hopefully, when you're watching these, this looks like quite a nice soft light, and the really cool thing is that this has a remote thing that comes with it as well, which means if I want to, I can just turn the light on and off, and you can see what a difference it makes, like, oh, this is going to, like, absolutely terrible, and then this is going to look hopefully pretty good, just because of the light, and you can also do things like dim the light, you can dim it right the way down to like zero percent, so if I wanted like a really subtle look, it probably do something like this, maybe you can't even tell that I've got a light, but actually I've got the light over there as a certain level of brightness, and then if I wanted to, I can branch the brightness all of the way up, and really make this really harsh looking, but still maybe soft light, that I would just never use in a video, so I usually have it hovering about 50 percent, and I move it around a bit and decide, yeah, you know, this is pretty reasonable level based on the the daylight, it doesn't look too studio-produced, because that's not really the look I want to go for, but it looks pretty reasonable, and obviously it looks ten times better than if I have the light off, because then suddenly this just looks absolutely terrible, and that is essentially the main setup that I used to film these videos. Sometimes if I want I use this camera the Sony A6500 as an overhead rig, that involves getting another one of these tiger microphones stands and trying to hack something together, it's it's not very stable, I'm looking for a more stable overhead setup that I can just set up, but otherwise this is pretty much how I've been recording my YouTube videos for the last two years, albeit with far less fancier cameras than this, and then in terms of behind the scenes if I move the light off to the side, this is my desk, I've got a video about my desk setup, if you want to have a look at that, I'll link that down below, I've got these two four terabyte hard drives that I have one as my main hard drive, one as a backup hard drive, I've got the 15 inch MacBook Pro connected to an LG 34 inch ultra wide, and I've got these two Alexadroll units from Ikea that store all of the rest of my gear in a very very disorganized fashion, more hard drives from 2018 batteries, cameras, lenses, audio interface, I basically like keeping the desk semi clean, although it's not very clean right now, so I've got these two house plants that are sort of on the verge of dying, which is not good, this is the Pachiro tree, this is really nice, it's quite hard to kill apparently, and I got it from a garden sent in nearby, this I don't know what it is, but it's like a really common house plant, and then I've got this spider plant that's also dying, I need to water that with some random stuff on the shelf, get time number one, get time number two, amplifier, when I'm busking, I like how there's something over here, something over here, and nothing in the middle, which means when I'm sitting down in this orientation, it's my head that is hopefully in between those two things, I don't know, I watched a couple of videos about how to frame videos, and they said something that, oh make sure you don't have any lines coming off your head and make sure kind of the lines are focusing on your face, and I sort of think that having the tree over there, and the shelf over there with the light does decent framing, I don't know, I don't really know anything about this, I'm just going with random YouTube tutorials that I watched at one point or another, so yeah that's pretty much everything that goes into this setup, it's always the A73, it's always the 24 millimeter lens, and occasionally I'll fuse my A6500 as an overhead rig or as a second camera angle, so I'm actually working on a series of videos where I share more about the behind the scenes of how I make these videos, so more about camera settings, extending out of lens, rationale, and also a lot about my editing workflow, and how I use final cut pro, and how I integrate things like iPad animations into my videos, I'm planning out videos based on that, so if you've got any questions about how these videos are made, please take them in comments down below, and I'll incorporate those into the plan for this new video series that I'm working on at some point, but yeah thanks for watching, if you like this video you should check out the video over here, that'll be a video of my traveling camera photography drone type setup that I used to take places when I want to do vlogging and photography, but yeah thanks for watching, and I'll see you in the next video, goodbye!
