# Medicine Application - No offers?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZBZVWONSTs
In this video, we talk about what to do if you don't get any offers for Medicine, or if you don't make your offers. It's a tricky and difficult position to be in, but we can't change what's happened, so it's important to look to the future and figure out an action plan.

## Transcript
 Hey guys, welcome back to the channel. If you're new here, my name is Ali. I'm a final year medical student at Cambridge University and in this video we're going to be talking about something that's not very often talked about on the internet or anywhere really and that's what to do if you don't get any offers for medicine or if you don't make your offer or you know dealing with rejection in that particular sphere. One thing to say off the bat, I was lucky enough to get in first time into medicine and therefore I don't really have any personal experience with with dealing with the rejection that comes from not getting it off of medicine or not making that offer in particular and you have quite a lot of experience with dealing with rejection generally which I'll be making a video about at some point further down the line probably in a few weeks time let me know in the comments if you want to hear that but I have spoken to a lot of my friends who didn't get in first time who got in maybe second third actually I've got a friend who got in I think fifth time it was and I've spoken to these people and asked what tips they would give if they were making a video about this so I'm just kind of acting as a conduit for them so I'll start off by giving you some of these tips kind of very quick fire the general advice that I've been given to give to you guys from people who've been through that experience and then we'll be cutting to segments of nine different tips from again various medical students giving their own take on what to do if you're a find yourself in that position where you've not got any offers or you've not made your offers and so on so I think first thing to say is that if you're in the position that you've got an offer but you didn't make your offer then you know the solution is pretty straightforward you need to apply again if you're interested in medicine get your grades behind you this time work mega mega hard if you have to make sure you get those grades because to be honest you've already done the lions share of the work in getting the offer in the first place it's just the final hurdle of making that offer which unfortunately tripped you up so that's a very targeted area that you need to work on you probably did everything right you personally staying was probably fine you interviews probably quite good which is why you got the offer in the first place but then it's just working on the grades so I'm going to put that aside and kind of aim this video towards people who maybe didn't get any offers for medicine who were who were in that sort of position because I think that's a trickier position to be in so general advice that I've gotten from people who've been through this the first thing they said was really think about whether it's what you want to do getting four rejections first time around is and can be quite painful quite disappointing but it gives you a chance to really kind of look inwards and and decide is this really the career for you do you really want to do it if you if you do really want to do it then fantastic you need to apply again but if you're in two minds about it if you're not really sure and you know you've put in all that effort applying the first time around and you're not sure if you can you can kind of do it again then it's it's a good time to ask yourself that question so that's point number one point number two is it is more practical if if you do want to apply again then look at in detail at every aspect of your application send it around to people send it around to friends who've gotten in send it around to people that you know the years above and ask them where they think the weak points were was it your personal statement could you've done more work experience did you get the interviews in the first place if you've got the interviews in the first place then chances are your personal statement and application generally were strong enough but you maybe your performance at interview that you down and that's something that I'm quite I'm quite familiar with again we'll talk about it in in the later video so then it's a case of working out okay why didn't my performance at interview let me down what could have done differently maybe you know just didn't go well on the day and being able to put in more and more interview practice because this is something that I've heard from quite a lot of doctors as well that I've spoken to about kind of future future careers and so on and they always say that it's it's not the best person who gets the job it's the person who performs best at the interview or the person who's prepared best for the interview so they will suggest that the interview is the most important part of your application and you know when applying for joint for jobs as doctors or as surgeons you've got your whole CV you've got publications presentation post this that and the other but unless your interview performance is stellar on the day then chances are you know going to get that job so I think if if you got interviews but then you didn't get the offer subsequently then maybe interview performances something to work on and we've got loads of videos on the channel that can help you kind of sort that out as it were but most of it generally does come from practicing with friends and family and teachers and anyone you can get really third point you want to think about where you're going to apply um a lot of people that I that I know when they apply first time around they said that they didn't think too hard about where they were applying and therefore you know with a average issue kick-out score they applied to university that requires you know a score in the 700s and obviously they didn't get the offer then so I know it sounds obvious but really think about where you're applying some places don't accept reach takes some places do some places don't like you when you take a gap here some places do all of this stuff research the universities actively in advance before applying and really tactically apply because to be honest if you're if you're reapplying then you probably want to go to medical school rather than to go to a particular medical school so you know what I'm saying medicine is kind of the same wherever you go in the UK so it really doesn't matter where you end up provided you end up somewhere studying medicine at least that's that's kind of the line of thinking for most people that that I know who were in that position so yeah I think about where you're going to apply a apply tactically point number four get excited because you have a whole year of endless opportunities that are not going to be available to anyone else and that was probably the same in point everyone said everyone I was looking to who has not gotten in the first time around was so happy that they didn't get in the first time around in hindsight like obviously it was disappointing and crushes all crushing at the time but having had one or two or three gap years and done interesting things they they're really glad to have had that experience things that they suggested was traveling getting a job working as a healthcare assistant these these experiences that people at university your friends at university won't be getting these at all they're just going to be going to lectures day and day out and maybe doing placements and things whereas if you get the chance to travel abroad and I don't volunteer in a hospital for a charity that'll enrich you much more as a person than a year of university is going to enrich your friends so it's not a competition between you and your friends but I think one way to feel better about you know doing the gap here is by making your gap you're really really good and doing things that will improve your profile as a person generally finally um a point that one of my friends said which I think is really good one is don't be too hard on yourself um this person was saying that she got rejected first time around she thought her application was pretty solid she thought her interview performance was quite reasonable but it still got four rejections um and she was saying that initially she like took it really really to heart um and for a few weeks it was quite sad about it and really didn't really do much wasn't sure what to do because of all the effort she put into this application and therefore you know it felt like you know all this effort went to waste um but what she said is that eventually she actually realised that you know maybe it wasn't maybe it wasn't her it was just that medicine is unfortunately very competitive there are loads of no to people wanting to study the subject uh and very few spaces relatively speaking so while you in mind not necessarily been a problem with you it might just have been that you know that that happened to be more people that wanted to do it then then we're able to get the offer so don't be too hard on yourself um I'd say I identify the areas that you think you might be weakened and sort of really actively track those down but there's very little to be gained from kind of feeling bad about yourself or feeling sorry for yourself or sort of thinking that you're not good enough because thinking you're not good enough is is not really the way to improvement I think the way to improvement is thinking that your performance at this particular domain was not good enough so if I get rejected often interview I think okay my performance at this interview wasn't very good therefore I need to improve my interview performance uh whereas I think a lot of people might might be going on the lines of I didn't get the offer therefore I'm not good enough or you know that that general genre of kind of self-flagulating uh things that we tell ourselves but yeah um don't be too hard on yourself work on the things that you need to work on but ultimately don't worry because things will hopefully work out for the best so those are my kind of five tips that I got from from various people from speaking to various people who've been through this now we're going to run through nine eight something like that different tips from various medical students uh some of us have uh gotten first time some of us hadn't uh but we've all spoken to people we were all friends with people who didn't get in the first time so we all kind of know what people say about the capiers um but yeah we're going to go through these nine tips coming up what I would say for people who who haven't made the grades or who who didn't hit me their offers or anything like that is I mean uh I want to say don't worry but I mean of of course you're going to worry uh what I would say is that there are a lot of people in my year and that I'm friends with who didn't get the offers first time around who took the gapiers even took two gapiers and every single one of those people have been happy that they took the gapiers there's not been a single person who says you know what I wish I'd gotten into medicine first time they all say I'm glad that in my gapier I worked with a healthcare system I traveled the world I did something cool but they're always glad that they had that experience so it probably seems like the end of the world when if you if you don't get the grades if you don't make that offer but you know gapiers are pretty good and provided you use that time well you will definitely be glad for it in the long run so I think you will know when that situation happens how disappointed you were um if if you were really upset by it and definitely have a passion for doing medicine still and then I would say go for it if if you think that you will then be able to sort of retake the exams if you need to and be able to get the grades then that will show a huge amount of determination and persistence and sort of a real passion and drive to do what you want to do and that will show in universities when you make a further application if you at that time think actually no medicine wasn't for me then then find do something else do a science degree maybe and it may be that you can do a three-year science degree and then at that point decide whether now now that you've gone and done something else whether you now want to switch to doing undergraduate or graduate medicine whichever you want to do so when I applied to medicine I didn't apply to a fifth choice I just thought if I don't get medicine I'm going to be trying again because there was nothing else that I wanted to do at all and so for me I knew it would have been a case of I haven't got the grades this time I will try my best to do them next year and try again until I get in for some people they take that fifth option because they know that they might want to do something else in the end and that's fine and you've still got the option later on of changing your mind very long story short when I was in sick form don't just go into details but basically I didn't get into medicine but when I was in my family year I applied to medicine again so that I could start a few months after graduating I didn't get in that time either so after I graduated I had basically I had a year off where I worked to health care assistant which I think is actually probably one of the best things that have happened to me because I learned so much and I think I grew into myself and I when I was at Lesser actually I learned how to learn and it definitely helped me in medicine so when I did eventually apply again to get for the graduate entry courses I did actually secure a spot so I think I tried to apply for something four times I think gotten on my fourth attempt basically so there's nothing wrong with not getting in straight away because I got there and I think I'm grateful that I didn't get in first of all because I think I've had a lot more life experience my advice is definitely take that take to heart but it is quite hard actually I think what's important about when if you don't get the grades or don't get offices bouncing back because it's if it's something you really want to do it it's definitely something that I definitely advise that you stick with so if you don't get the grades do you re-sits if or if you don't get the grades do what I did go to uni improve that you can succeed in a particular area and then use that grade if you don't succeed and if you just ask for feedback I think some places actually do give you feedback or to feedback so you know what went wrong so you know what to fix and if you don't do well in the interest exams then just apply based on that so if you do your cake hat in the style of September and you don't get a good enough score then maybe go towards universities that don't take your cake hat if that makes it and so I will say that I honestly believe that if you're destined to do medicine you will get in eventually you may not get in first time may not even get in second time but you will always get a spot and I think that motivation and determination is what defines my mix it's not how smart you are it's not how you know how many levels you get or how many teachers you get it's how hard working you are because a lot of the time the content is not that difficult it's just that there's so much of it so even if you don't get in first time I think that you will honestly just keep applying and always learn from what you've done before and I think that's most important thing you can actually write to universities afterwards and ask maybe why didn't write interview go well or why did you not ask me for interview so make sure that you get that feedback work on that feedback and if you do take time off make sure that you make the most of that time off so if you're taking a year out make sure that you volunteer make sure that you're in working on your science improving those grades if you're doing re-takes make sure that you make sure make the most of any time that you have so that when you come back to apply again you can give it your best shot so I think with things like this you have to be very realistic as well but you cannot also have to decide what you really want to do in life if you don't get in the first time it loads of people don't get into medicine the first try you don't beat yourself up but if that's really what you want to do keep keep going at it check do you work experience figure out what is it that really pushes you and tries to figure out why and like look back and you said why why you didn't make it what you have done differently and I really think about that grades are really important obviously we have to be realistic about that so we have to also understand if if you're not the best student maybe there's something else similar to medicine that you could be doing as well because medicine itself is quite an academic thing and it's a little unfair on yourself as well to put yourself into something that you might struggle a little bit with and there's so many other things that you could do as well so I suppose really looking back and deciding what it is that you really want to do in the life yeah I think not not getting into medicine is going to be is it'll be a big knock on confidence I think is a big barrier but it will be and it might be the first big failure you all have experienced and it'll probably be one of many in your life so it's important to be able to deal with that in a productive and constructive way so I think similar to markets really reflecting and it's not wallowing in self-pity I mean you can wallow this office and then you get up and realize you know with that reflect realistically if it's not I'd say if medicine is something you're actually passionate about and you really want to do then go for it because actually sometimes I think the grades are so high for medicine and actually what what makes a really great doctor is someone who can work hard and be empathetic and and talk to patients in a in a really great way and understand patients and actually there are lots of routes in to medicine so even if you if you don't make the grades for undergrad medicine you can do drugs and medicine there's so many different ways you can get there it's all about if you want to work hard for it and as she says that's the important thing work really really working hard because that's what people have to do in medicine and so my main thing to say is that you know medicine is a very long career even if you progress at the first time at every hurdle you're still looking at a really really long career and lots of different hoops to jump through lots of hurdles so if you think it's something you want to do a year is really negligible in the scheme of things if you've been rejected from your first application ask for feedback you know send your personal statement around and see if anybody thinks what you could have done differently and try and learn from it but you really shouldn't be put off just because you didn't get in that year because it's a it's a complete lifestyle commitment once you sign up to medicine so if you want to do it if you wanted to do it in 2017 you should still want to do it in 2018 from an application point of view and also you know a lot of people do get rejected at various different stages and personally you know a Cambridge a couple of my friends and now here as medical students having been rejected from all for medical schools sometimes including arts bridge sometimes not including arts bridge so don't worry if you do you do receive a load of rejections you should just pick yourself up and think if this is something I do want to do it's worth fighting for yeah so if you if you think that medicine is a career which you really want to go into think about retaking your levels um think about made the most use of any gap years which you have um sometimes you could not get in because you've applied to the schools which demand a higher range of grades then then the ones which you got so now with arm do of the grades which you have now got you can pitch your applications appropriately but make the most use of the gap year which you have use it to obviously enjoy yourself but at the same time it's where I explore the medicines a career which you really want to get into there are number of charities which you can involve yourself with you could even work part times a healthcare assistant or full time healthcare assistant and you could work as a flip bottomist you could get involved in the medical sector without actually being a daughter yet think the long view of your career medicine is a really long path and before you start in it because it kind of can be a real yellow brick road all the way through and you become a consultant but like before you even start in this part think about whether you really want to do it. Okay so that brings us to the end of this video that was five tips at the beginning and then like nine tips from me and again various other medical students talking about what you might want to think about if you're in this position where you've not got an in your offer or you have a major offer or you know stuff like that um I hope you found it useful to probably quite a long video but I hope there was something that you took away uh that you can like and kind of help you and it's coming here it's a difficult position to be in dealing with rejection is never straightforward and especially when you've worked so hard for it it can be really really hard but I think it's all about kind of looking to the future and not really dwelling on the past as it were so yeah thank you for watching if you liked the video please give it a thumbs up if you haven't subscribed to the channel please consider doing so more stuff about preparing for interviews and vlogs of life as a medical student if you're into watching that sort of thing uh coming up and yeah thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next video bye bye
