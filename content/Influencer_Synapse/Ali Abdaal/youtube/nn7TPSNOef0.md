## Transcript
 Hey guys, welcome back to the channel and to probably the penultimate study with me video. This video takes place the day before our final exams start. So I work up around 9 a.m. struggle to get out of bed for a while, went upstairs, made my usual breakfast of three wee to bixers, and I was sad because there was no more squeezy honey left in the house, which means I had to have the wee to bixers, which just milk and that's not very nice. Then I've friend Callum woke up. We're going to mix a coffee and we're using this thing. I don't actually know what you call these things, but you know you're screwing together and sticking on there and it makes very coffee, so come and join. After breakfast, I spent a bit of time replying to you guys emails, a quick plug, I have a weekly email newsletter, you can always reply to it, to talk to me if you like, and then I thought I should probably start some work. But before doing so, I had to clean my room obviously. So I spent the first half of the morning looking over history taking and systems reviews, so what that means is that when you're talking to a patient and you know taking the history to work at what's going on, there comes a point where they're not going to say anything more because they've said what they want to say. And you have to ask them a series of quite close questions like, you know, do you have any chest pain, heavy experience when you're shortness of breath, have you been having an nausea vomiting, all of that kind of stuff that just screens for any other problems that might be going on. And there's a point I want to make here about categorization. Now categorization is a very magical technique. In fact, after space repetition and active recoil is probably the third most important example technique and that is categorizing anything you can whenever you can. So for instance, for my neurological systems review, there are about eight or nine different questions I need to ask, but I managed to categorize those into like four different things and kind of lump a few things together so that I only had to learn four things rather than nine. Anyway, after doing some categorization to make sure I remembered these systems review questions, I asked myself, what if it came up tomorrow in the exam, would I be least happy about? This is like a thing that I constantly asked myself and asked myself more and more often as we approach the exam. I thought that there was a slight possibility that a sexual health case might come up and there are a series of questions that we need to ask the patient and that. Now this is a numbered list rather than bullet points. And in my head, I'm constantly making links up between the various points so I can better remember them. If we start by asking them if they have any vaginal discharge then the discharge cues us to ask about itchiness and that cues us to ask about pain. If there's itchiness then that cues us to ask us about skin changes around the vagina and if there's skin changes around the vagina that cues to ask, oh, are there any skin changes around the rest of the body? Do they have any systemic rushes? So you can see how a list of seven becomes kind of connected together so that you don't need to memorise a list of seven instead of you. We've things together in a connected way. And while going through this topic, I'm actively thinking about how I might remember it because I don't trust my memory to just be able to remember something that I wrote down and I think this is another mistake that people sometimes make and that I certainly used to make is that I'd be making notes and I'd be thinking that the the act of making notes is making stuff going to my brain but that's just like never ends up happening but if while making notes you can kind of make a few new monics you can like make these active links between the different topics that just increases the number of cues available for recall which increases their kind of encoding of the memory which makes the memory stronger which means you're more likely to remember it in an exam or whenever you're asked about it. So after spending 30 minutes reading about sexually transmitted infections and looking at pictures of vaginal and pinal rashes we decided to have lunch and I'll see you after the break. After lunch I spend some time going through various role plays in an oski preparation book. I read through the patient history and then do my best to come up with the possible diagnosis that the patient could have and then I write these down on my iPad in a very rough untidy way because the objective is not to make notes here it's to act of recall and to remember stuff and when I write stuff down I can like categorize things which is a lot easier to do on paper or an iPad than it is to do in in one's head or reading out loud so that's why I like writing stuff down while I'm actively be calling and again this touches back onto the point about categorization and the more we categorize things the more likely we are to remember them in fact like when I was on my on my first surgical rotation as as a clinical medical student I remember one of the surgeons asking what are the causes of small bowel obstruction and in my head I just could start kind of listing listing off the causes of small bowel obstruction but then like one of the one of the registrars said that in surgery and in medicine broadly there is a phrase categorize or die this is clearly a bit more melodramatic than it needs to be but the point to making is that no one wants to hear you read off a list of things they want to hear you categorize them so now if I were asked about the causes of small bowel obstruction I would say that the common causes of the irritations and hernias but other causes can be categorized based on the fact that the bowel is a hollow tube and if it's a hollow tube it can be blocked from the outside it can be blocked due to problem in the wall or it can be blocked from something in the lumen and then I could list off all the various things within those categories that cause small bowel obstruction so yeah just a minor digression that goes kind of goes with the point that categorization is really really useful and you should be categorizing absolutely everything you can if you want to kind of increase your retention of of of the subject there's another point here that might be helpful and and something that I often tell myself while revising is that I should not trust my memory and I'm going back to the point I made earlier about how writing notes down just I'm just not going to trust my memory to remember the stuff I've written down so as I'm writing stuff down I'm making the monics and while I was going through the stuff in this oski preparation book one of the questions that came up was what are the components of a confusion screen I eat if a patient is confused and we don't know why they're confused what are the various different tests that we run to try to work at why they're confused out a confusion screen is a really important thing to know and I thought it was quite a reasonable exam question that might have come up so I decided to I thought to myself how am I going to learn the confusion screen so what I did was that I wrote down the various components of the confusion screen and then like rejigled them around so they made a reasonable nemonic so the nemonic I came up with is CBT MSG and I quite like these sort of three letter acronyms of things that we already know what they are so CBT is cognitive behavioral therapy MSG monocidium glutamate obviously the point is that I have the letters CBT and MSG together in my head so it's a lot easier to remember CBT MSG than it is to remember like cmsbtg or something like that and I'm not saying that you should be overly relying on nemonics and you should be trying to make nemonics absolutely everything but what I'm saying is that yeah if you're asked about the confusion screen or anything else you could probably work out a lot of them from first principles because they are sort of common sense and you kind of come across them a bit but if you want to be slick and you want to increase the amount of cues you have available for recall it's just nice having a nemonic as an option anyway for the next couple of hours sub comes over and wants to practice some history taking so we bash through the cases in this book we read out what the patient presents with and then we have a moment of silence while everyone in the room thinks or writes down what the possible diagnosis could be and then we discuss the case and kind of work out what the answers are this way we all get practice and no one is spoon feeding anyone else so we can all work through a large number of cases in a small amount of time and we can all be practicing act of recall by ourselves because ultimately we are going to be taking this exam by ourselves so now it's 5pm and at this point we've been through all the history cases in the oski preparation book the exam is the following morning and I don't think there are any more holes that I need to plug at this point obviously I don't know everything but I'm pretty confident that I know enough to comfortably pass the exam so I spend the next year I was doing some editing around 7pm we order some sushi for dinner as a pre-exam tree and you know while we're eating it we chat over some more scenarios talk about what might come up in the exam tomorrow. Jake comes in at some point and we run a quick role play then Catherine comes in and we run another role play so overall you know after 5pm it's pretty chill but we're still doing a bit of group work it's still quite fun because we're all working together but we're still kind of being productive so now we're going to go to me from the past who coincidentally was wearing exactly the same outfit and I'm going to share my thoughts tonight before the exam. All right guys so that brings us to the end of another study with me video thank you very much for watching our first exam is tomorrow this is the first in our crop of oski's so we've got five stations tomorrow for history taking stations and then one challenging station which is going to be a mystery um feeling quite relaxed about it just done my pre-exam shave so I look slightly slightly more clean shave in the usual um but yeah I'm I'm sure tomorrow I'll be going to the toilet many many times before the exam but what I like to try and do is kind of tell myself that that feeling in my tummy is excitement rather than fear or stress and there's this thing I read on the internet that said that that's like a legit way to kind of hack your brain into thinking that you're having fun rather than absolutely terrified so hopefully it'll be it'll go right um yeah you're probably going to be seeing this miles after my exams are done and if you're watching this then you probably have exams of your own so I'll be smiling briefly on Instagram stories because I'll be finished but if you're watching this and you should go and you should have exams and all the very best of luck with them I really hope you smash them thank you very much for watching the video if you liked it please give it a thumbs up if you haven't subscribed to the channel please consider doing so I have a lovely evening and I'll maybe see you in the next video. Good luck with your abrasion. Good luck with your exams. Good night.
