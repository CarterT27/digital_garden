 This video is sponsored by Squarespace, whether you need a domain, website or online store, make it with Squarespace. Hey guys, welcome back to the channel. If you're new here, my name is Ali. I'm a junior doctor working in Cambridge and in this video I'm going to be talking about why the Apple AirPods are not only my favorite pair of headphones but actually why they're one of the pieces of tech that's added the most value to my life over the past two years. I'll start with a quick run through of some of the features of them and then I'll spend the bulk of the video talking about why I think they've added so much value to my life and therefore why I think they're worth every penny and then at the end we'll just do a quick comparison with some of these other kind of fairly expensive headphones and it's kind of comparing them and deciding the pros and cons of each of them versus the AirPods as usual everything is going to be timestamped in the video description and in a pinned comment so you can skip around if you feel like it but yeah let's just jump into it. Alright so the most important setting point is the convenience of the AirPods. They come in this little box, you can store the box in your pocket at all times and if you want to get something out you just open the box, put them in one ear, put the other one in the other ear and then you automatically connect it to any iOS device that you own and you can just hit play on your Apple Watch or using Siri or using your phone and then you're playing whatever you like. Another really cool feature is that if you're listening to something and you want to speak to someone in real life you just take out one of the AirPods and then that automatically pauses whatever you're listening to and then when you finish your conversation you put it back in and then it resumes exactly where you're left off and I find myself using this at least once every day and I get a little burst of endorphin release in my brain whenever I do because it's just really cool. Sound quality is pretty average if I'm being honest. Sound quality should not be a reason why you buy these convenience should be a reason why you buy these. They sound like normal Apple ear pods which is not bad but it's not amazing and certainly doesn't come close to any fancy a pair of proper headphones but you know it's not really about the sound quality. Sound quality is fairly average. If you're worried about them falling out I think this does vary for different people but for me they literally never fall out like I you know where the more the time I take them to the gym I cycle in them I run with them in the rain the cold and the wind and I can count on one hand the number of times they've ever fallen out. In fact the only time they have fallen out is when I've been playing squash against myself hitting a ball against a wall and if I occasionally miss hit it and fire the ball straight back at my face and I have to duck then that sort of movement causes one of them to fall out but I mean apart from extreme circumstances like that they just kind of stay in my ear and this is this is quite surprising to me like before getting these I thought oh god what if they fall out and you know I was taking that risk but they just don't fall out so pretty marvelous miracle of engineering. Okay so that was a quick look at some of the features of the AirPods but to be honest I don't really like thinking about features that much I think because tech is ultimately a tool it's a lot more important what you do with it rather than the product of the tool itself. So if the AirPods are a tool then what can you do with them that justifies their price tag of I think 160 pounds and to answer that let's do a little hypothetical thought experiment. So what if hyperthetically you could snap your fingers and then magically you'd be able to listen to whatever you wanted in your head. I've let's say you wanted to listen to an episode of the Tim Ferrissia podcast or you wanted to play something on Spotify. What if you were able to snap your fingers and suddenly this you know there would be some magical chip or something in your head that would just allow that to be heard in your ear. Let's ignore the creepy implications of this because you know this is just a thought experiment we don't have to worry about that. But you know if you could make that happen snap your fingers and play whatever you want in your head I personally would pay quite a lot of money for that feature. Why would I pay a lot of money for a feature like that mainly because it would allow me to listen to more podcasts and audiobooks and over the last four years since I discovered them podcasts and audiobooks have added an enormous amount of value to my life. So so my favorite podcast the Tim Ferriss show Matt Divellas the Grand Up Show the indie hackers podcast Seth go ahead and start up school the GaryVee or the experience. All of these various podcasts have been a quite inspiring and that they've inspired me to start things like my YouTube channel my email newsletter they've inspired me to grow my side businesses which have helped me grow my passive income and that contributes to freedom and generally increased lifestyle choices. But also they've offered a lot of practical advice in terms of you know productivity, happiness, minimalism, interior design, health fitness and just like all sorts of different areas that I wouldn't necessarily have got information about if I hadn't been listening to these podcasts in audiobooks. Now let's go back to this hypothetical magical ability of if we could snap our fingers we'd be able to listen to whatever podcast we want. I think that's so valuable because if we had that ability our guarantee we'd all be listening to a lot more podcasts because suddenly we've just reduced the friction down to zero like if we're doing the laundry or hanging up the laundry or doing the dishes or going down to empty the trash or kind of going for a two minute walk down the road at that point you know normally it would be a bit of a path to get our like earphones out and like untangle them and put them in our ears and we just probably wouldn't bother doing it for such small tasks like that but if we've all of a sudden got the ability to snap our fingers and you know listen to whatever we want in our heads suddenly the friction is zero and we might as well just listen to a podcast or continue our audiobook while we're doing all these menial other activities that are going to take up our time. And now going back to the AirPods the reason I love the AirPods so much is because I think they come quite close to approximating this magical hypothetical ability to snap our fingers and listen to whatever we want. The friction is so low with the AirPods you can just pop them open, stick them in your ear and it takes about three to four seconds and hit play on your Apple Watch or just you know if you double tap the side of them then you open up Siri and then you can ask it to resume Spotify or overcast or whatever. The friction is so low that I found that in the last two years since I've had these AirPods I have been using them practically every day while doing minial activities around the house like as I said putting out the trash, doing the laundry, hanging out the laundry, doing the dishes all of this sort of stuff that previously I would not have been listening to anything because it's too much of a fact to get my proper headphones out or you know I'm tangled my ear pods or whatever but now because the AirPods just make it so, so convenient I've ended up listening to a lot more podcast than audiobooks over the last two years since owning these and as we established because podcos and audiobooks can add value to your life therefore the AirPods add a lot of value by facilitating that you know listening to audio experience if that makes sense so hopefully by this point I've explained that you know podcos and audiobooks can add a lot of value to our lives at least they have for me and if something as small as these can reduce the friction of to listening to podcos and audiobook and therefore can facilitate the process of listening to them then these are going to be quite valuable which I have found in my life as well so the question is are they worth the 160 pounds that Apple asked us to pay for them and in my opinion the answer is yes every day of the week I've had these for just under two years now that's 24 months 160 divided by 24 is like six pound fifty or something so the question is what are we happy to pay six pounds fifty a month to have the ability to snap my fingers and listen to whatever I want whenever I want or something very close to it and the answer is yes in a heartbeat six pound fifty a month is absolutely worth the price of these given the amount of value that they've added to my life over the last two years but that was the main thing that I wanted to say in this video if you have an iPhone or any kind of i device and you listen to a lot of podcos the audiobooks then you should definitely get the AirPods you won't be disappointed but now let's just do a quick comparison with some of these other headphones and I think the most fair comparison is with these beats YOD sort of wireless headphones and these are quite popular this one is about 150 pounds but you can get it for free when Apple does their education he discount things like I got this with my MacBook but you can get similar ones on Amazon for about 20 quid like J bird or other kind of brands and I used to have these similar headphones before I invested in the AirPods and these are quite nice they are sort of wireless and they do fit in the ear a bit better so these are more designed for sports you have to like hold a button down for a few seconds and then it turns on and the beats ones are pretty good because of the synergy between beats and Apple because Apple own beats and they've got these some these these ones have got some kind of processor in them that lets it connect to IOS devices automatically because of that they're quite convenient to pair but even so I found myself having to use these for a period of about a month when I thought I'd lost my AirPods turned out they were actually behind the sofa which is a bit annoying but I had to use these and I found that even with something as convenient as these even with headphones like this that are designed for the Apple ecosystem it was still a lot of a fact to actually use them on a regular basis and actually I ended up only using my earphones when going to and from work which is about a 10-15 minute skateboard ride and I take the effort to put them on press the button but I found that when I was doing chores around the house I just wasn't getting these out because they were we approached getting tangled up even with such a small wire because of this whole stuff and secondly the friction was still too high to bother kind of putting them in and listening to a podcast if I was just doing something like hanging up the laundry so even when you've got product designed for the Apple ecosystem they still don't come anywhere close to the AirPods in terms of the amount of convenience that they offer so that's something important to mention and also got these Bose QC35s these are wonderful these are amazing noise canceling headphones incredible for planes and trains and the London Underground where it's very noisy but I don't take these out of the house unless I'm traveling for long distances because again these are even though they're wireless they're just I'm not going to get these out of my drawer and put them on and then turn them on and wait for them to pair connected to others I've only I'm not going to wait for all that to happen just to do something like put out the trash or put out the laundry and I'm definitely not going to wear noise canceling headphones when I'm going to work on my skateboard or cycling or anything like that so these are amazing for long distance travel but otherwise I don't really use them and finally I've got these wired audio technica ATHM50Xs which I only ever use for music related things like if I'm creating an audio track on logic pro or something apparently these give you a better almost studio sounding quality rather than stuff like this because proper headphones distort the bass and all this stuff I don't really know I got these for music editing and I only ever use them for that so yeah no one really uses wired headphones anyway why would you use wired headphones if we have it we're joined the wireless revolution but yeah that brings us to the end of this video I hope you found it useful uh essentially the point of trying to argue is that the AirPods are bloody incredible they're really really good and I think they've added a huge amount of value to my life over the last two years because they've allowed me to listen to more podcasts and more audiobooks because they have just reduced the friction of you know listening to stuff to the point where I'd happily put them in and listen to stuff while I'm doing media activities around the house like doing laundry or putting out the trash and I think they're worth every penny and I'm going to keep these on me forever and hopefully at some point the AirPods 2 are going to come out so you'll see a video review about those but to be honest I think you know there's no much point in waiting if you think these can add some value to your life there's no point thinking oh Apple might release the AirPods 2 in 8 months time so wait for I reckon just go for these you won't be disappointed they are absolutely amazing right that's enough fanboying for me for one day um before ending I'd just like to say a big thank you to Squarespace
