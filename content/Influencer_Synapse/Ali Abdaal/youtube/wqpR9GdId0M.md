## Transcript
 Hey guys, welcome back to the channel. If you're new here, my name is Ali, I'm a junior doctor working in Cambridge, and in this video I'm going to be sharing my thoughts about the paper-like screen protector that I've been using on my iPad Pro for the last few months. As usual, I'm going to start by sharing my overall thoughts so that if that's all you want, you don't have to watch the whole video, but then I'll expand on that a little bit more and talk about the installation, talk about how it feels and talk about the pros and cons of this specific screen protector. So overall thoughts, I think it's worth it. It's about 30 pounds, and that's a lot of money to pay for a screen protector, but to be honest, I think if you're spending 500,000 pounds on an iPad or an iPad Pro, you might as well get a decent screen protector, there's no point in spending two pounds on a screen protector that's covering your beautiful thousand pound screen. And yeah, other than that's not really much to say, it does the job, it protects the screen. I spilled some tea on this the other day, and it survived. I think thanks to the screen protector, but also it does sort of make it feel like you're writing on a piece of paper. Like, if you're right on just the glass screen, there's not much resistance when you're when you're writing on just a glass screen, but if you're writing on the paper like protector, like, I don't know if you can hear that. There's more resistance, so it does, it does very slightly improve the experience of writing. Is it life-changing? No, absolutely not. It's not going to be something to tell your grandkids about, but to be honest, it does make the experience of using the iPad Pro for me a little bit nicer. And you know, that little bit extra niceness of experience is something that I would happily pay the 30 pounds for. So those were my overall thoughts, I'd recommend it. If you're interested in buying it, I'll put an affiliate link in the description below. So if you buy it from that link, I'll make about enough money for a cup of coffee. But other than that, I have no financial interest in making this video. They're not paying me to make it. They're not sponsoring the video. I had to buy the product myself. I'm just making the video because this is a good product that I use every day and that I like and that I want to recommend to you guys. So yeah, please click my link if you want to buy it, or don't, I'll put an honor affiliate link as well if you're really going to, you know, to provide me with that, however much it costs for half a cup of coffee, but yeah, whatever you like. Let's now talk about a few other details. So firstly, why do I go for the paper like? I'll be honest, I've not really tried any of the other screen protectors in the market, but I did spend a little bit of time researching and on my video about making notes on the iPad Pro which will appear there somewhere. On that video, there were quite a few comments from people recommending the paper like. I've also got a friend who is a digital artist and she watches those videos, you know, done by digital artists, and apparently a lot of them recommend the paper so with those endorsements, I decided to just order it and see what happens and then it arrived and I installed it and it was pretty great. Secondly, let's talk about the installation. The installation process was fairly painless, although there was a mistake I made initially and that kind of screwed up the first attempt at installing it, but luckily, I think they thought this quite far ahead, they include two screen protectors and two installation kits with the package. So it's just a case of, you know, you line it up and then you put some stickers to make sure it's aligned in the right place and then you get like, you know, a card of some sort to like get rid of the bubbles and then in about five minutes you've installed it and it never comes off and like you can't even to really tell that it's on there, there's no real other than the feel which feels more like matte and more like what's supposed to work more frictiony than the normal glass surface. It's really quite hard to tell that there is a screen protector on there. So far, those are pretty glowing endorsements. It does have one drawback, I mean apart from the price, which isn't really a drawback, because you might as well invest in quality. The only drawback really is that I don't know if you can see this on camera, but if you have like a white background, there's a bit more noise in the image than you would expect. I don't think it's going to come across on camera and it's not something that you notice other than, you know, the first time you look at it and you realise, oh hang on, why is this, why are the whites a bit more grainy than I'm used to? Then I tried watching videos in YouTube and Netflix and stuff and the noise disappears when you're watching anything that's not pure white. But you know, if I'm writing on no stability, then I can sort of tell that the white is not like as pure white as it would be without the screen protector. But to be honest, that's something you stop noticing and it doesn't really make any difference. And to be honest, I'm really glad I got this, because I still might be on it and that would have been the thousand pound iPad Pro down the drain, where and not for the screen protector. So overall, those are my thoughts. This was a very quick video review of the paper like screen protector. If you like it, you can buy it in the description. There's going to be a link, I think paper like.com forward slash Ali. If you click on that link, it'll make me a few, a few quid. So thanks very much for watching.
