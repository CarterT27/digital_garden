## Transcript
 Alright, so I used to think that the bigger my screen and the more stuff I could pile on my desk, the more productive I had the potential to be, recently I realised that the bigger isn't necessarily better. And so when Apple announced the new lineup of IMAX a few weeks ago, I realised it's the perfect excuse to simplify and minimise my desk setup but first let's start by tearing down the old one. I start by taking stock and wondering how my life ended up in such a profound mess, like honestly, where does all this junk even come from? I say goodbye to the multiple keyboards, the books and my anti-fungal nail cleaner, before sorting out the various cables and unplugging all of my devices, it takes half an hour to dismantle the 49 inch ultra wide monitor, and we say goodbye to the trusty Mac Mini. We give the desk a wipe in a clean, and now it's time to unbox the new IMAX. It's the most cleverly designed box I've ever seen, with fancy compartments for all the different bits. I get everything unboxed, get everything set up, plug in just a single cable and we'd good to go. Let's dive into the tour! So the first thing that's obviously powering the entire thing is the 2021 M1 IMAX, this is currently the base model, so it's only got two Thunderbolt ports, 8GB of RAM and a 256GB solid state drive, that is absolutely tiny, I have a fully beefed out one that's on the way that's going to arrive in about six weeks, I've upgraded that to 16GB of RAM and two terabytes of the hard drive. And this bad boy is connected to the Cal Digit TS3 Thunderbolt dock via a single USB-C cable, which snakes underneath the desk so you can't really see it. This dock is absolutely amazing, I used to have it connected to my M1 Mac Mini, again, that only had two ports, there's a real problem with these random Apple products that they don't have enough ports. And so right now the Cal Digit Dark has an Ethernet cable attached to it, it's got my Elgato Camlink, it's got my sure SM7B microphone connected to the 2i4 audio interface. The main accessories for the IMAX are the ones that came with the product, so we've got the new blue, like Sky Blue, whatever it's called Apple Keyboard and Apple Magic Mouse, sadly the keyboard is the one without the Touch ID, because I didn't get the Spectat version and that's on the way in about six weeks. And I've also got a magic track pen on the way, because I like that to be a staple part of my desk setup. Termless speakers, I'm still using the Canto YouTube white speakers, these are absolutely amazing, they're so pretty, they look nice, they go with the blue and white kind of aesthetic and they sound amazing as well. And those are connected via USB-A to the Cal Digit dock, which is then connected to the IMAX. In terms of other things, we've got connected to the dock, we've got firstly the Ethernet cable, which gives me wired internet at the moment, it's 300 megabits down and 50 megabits up, which is not too bad. And secondly, we've got the focus right to I4 Audio Interface, normally my short SM7B microphone is plugged into this, and that's plugged into the cloud lift to preamp to give it a little bit more gain. And that's the audio setup that I generally use when I'm recording a podcast or recording a voiceover for a video or teaching live sessions of my course, the part-time YouTuber Academy. Also connected to the dock, we have the Elgato Cam Link 4K, this is a little USB-Dongal type thing that lets my camera connect via HDMI to the computer, so again, if I'm really trying to flex on a Zoom call or in a teaching session for the YouTuber Academy, I can use the output from this camera to stream via Zoom and everyone's like, oh my god, I can't believe your camera setup is so good. Thanks to the fact that the new IMAX has a decent webcam and actually pretty reasonable built-in microphones though, I probably won't need to use a lot of the external camera external mics for most of my Zoom calls these days, which is kind of nice, makes me a bit more of a minimalist. Right next to the dock, we have this set Trilogy from Austin Clion, we're starting off with steel like an artist and then show your work and then keep going, these are books that I've had on my desk for the last few months and it's really nice because if I'm in a bit of a slump, I just pick up a random one of them and open it to a random page and I always end up learning something and they serve the side effect of hiding the cables behind my desk. And in terms of the other accessories, right now I've got this, you cruise a teapot thing in blue, it's got some English breakfast, decaffinated tea in it because it's the evening and caffeine after two pm is bad for you, but this sort of goes with the blue vibe of the whole desk setup as well and of course what desk setup would be complete without the fake IKEA, Vegcar, Potted Plant or FICO or whatever you end up calling this is nice because it adds a little splash of greenery and I've had this exact same one on my desk setup since like 2015 or something like that so it's been with me for a while. Moving on to the other side, firstly I have a deck of cards, again this is blue, it's all coincidence but like blue is my favourite colour, I feel like blue is my personal accent colour and so it's kind of nice, little stuff on my desk, it's some shade of blue in some capacity, oh god, that one, that one, that was all right, that was all right, that was all right and then right next to the deck of cards I've got my augmonke analog, this is a paper to do this system, you guys have seen me talk about it before, it's a bit overpriced for what it is but it's really nice, it's really nice designs, the walnut wood and it comes with these this like bunch of cards so you have like a card for every day and you can write your paper to do list and you have some cards for next and you have some cards for some day, mostly it's the today cards that I use because I like having a to do list on paper and it just feels nice and feels aesthetic and then the really cool thing is once you write it down on paper and you can like prop it up in the dock thing and this is kind of cool, this looks really awesome and it helps me keep track of all the things I need to do in a day, the only other thing on the desk itself is this Tomons lamp which has a nice kind of Pixar looking look with a Phillips Hugh Lightbulb inside it, in fact we've got Phillips Hugh Lightbulb's all around the living room and in my bedroom as well so I can always change the lights if I want a different kind of setup for example Alexa turn on read in the living room oh, a little bit yellow or Alexa turn on spring blossom in the living room so having talked about all the stuff on the desk let's talk about the desk itself, now this is the fully Jarvis Bamboo, I think this is about 180 centimeters fully very kindly sent this to me about two years ago and I absolutely love it, it's an electronic standing desk and I often switch between sitting and standing modes and the other piece of furniture this is the Herman Miller sail this is a very very very nice chair I've got it in white and blue again to match the aesthetic and it's the most comfortable desk chair I've ever used it's amazing would recommend then on the side of the desk we've got an IKEA Alex drawer unit sadly it's in black I really wish it were if it were in white but I haven't changed it since I first got it like two and a three years ago now and in the drawers we've got an absolute mess of a load of stuff I need to figure out a way of organizing this and Marie Condoing my kind of desk setup drawer and then on the floor right next to the Alex drawer unit and underneath the desk I have got my Alienware gaming desktop PC currently I have no way of actually plugging it into anything because sadly I can't use the iMac as an external display but what I'm thinking about doing at some point if I really want to be supremely unproductive is getting one of those L shaped standing desks and so having like the iMac as the productivity setup and one bit of it and having like a Windows gaming PC setup on the other side that's the absolute dream so I'm working on making that happen and underneath the desk we also have these hooks which have magnetized to the underside of the desk and on one of them I have the switch pod this is a nice tripod that I use for my camera sometimes if I'm a vlogging and occasionally I'll use the other hooks for keys or for headphones or things like that but generally it's the switch pod I've got underneath and finally in terms of cable management I'm using these wire mesh type things to hide some of the cables and the challenge with cable management with a standing desk is that you want the cables to be managed when the desk is in sitting mode and also in standing mode right now I haven't really done a great job of this and the Alienware is hiding most of the mess of cables but the white stuff does make a difference and then on the other side of the desk where I've got an extra extension pod I've hidden that inside this white plastic containery type thing which will which hopefully makes the entire desk look as cable free as possible I think overall I've done a pretty good job of the cable management on the desk like you generally can't see a cable in sight that's because they're all hidden behind you know this mess of books by Austin Clio so that's a desk that if you like this you should definitely hit the subscribe button because I am looking to upgrade this with an L-shaped desk and be a little bit less minimal than this setup and if you like this video you might like to check out this video over here which is my review of the brand new M1 iMac so thank you so much for watching and I'll see you in the next video bye bye
