## Transcript
 Hi, everyone! Hi! So, it's our last afternoon here in Numpen, and we're just staying by the river side and watching some go down. Guys, I saw your favorite bit of been about our time in Numpen. The people to be honest, everybody at CSE is just been so lovely and nice. Yeah, it's like a really big family. It's been so great to be part of that family for just the best part of the month, two months. Yeah, it's been really good. I've enjoyed how chill it's been. We've been able to go into the hospital whenever we wanted to. Not going if we didn't want to. And it's kind of been like a semi-workin' holiday. This has been really nice. And yeah, as Ben said, people have been so friendly. People are awesome. Like even the taxi drivers, like the tech tech drivers, people in restaurants. They all want to help you. Even if they don't understand English, they'll do their best. That's a pretty cool place. And some of the operations we've done have been pretty incredible too. Gilling into skulls. That was a pretty good experience. Yeah, that was a good experience. I'll probably never get to do that again. Yeah. Drought a whole. Looking back, I'm very glad that we picked. If you're on a pen as a place to go, just because it's so vibrant, it's so chaotic. It's just so different from the UK. And I'm glad we didn't go somewhere slightly more developed, like Australia or Australia. Because it starts out every one of the marocardals for it. Yeah, you guys really are. We found such a different experience. Anything we wouldn't have seen in the West. Now we're just going to hang out. Watch the sunset. So thank you for sticking with us for a journey in non-Pen. And stay tuned for the journey around the rest of Cambodia. And around Vietnam as well. Thank you. Bye. Bye. A life was great to you at its colors. Like a moon is the sun we don't care about the others. You said, night world of fire. Your night heart stays silent. I just want to. Hello again. So after watching that beautiful sunset, we had dinner at a lovely Lebanese restaurant. And now we're at the Night Market, which seems like a good place to end the story of Clon Pen. I actually just ran into a random person who saw me bust out the camera rig. And after I was a YouTuber, apparently she's trying to start her own channel with us. He protects us. So that was quite exciting. Tomorrow morning, we've got a taxi ride to Baton Bung. And that begins our three week excursion in the rest of Cambodia in Vietnam. So thank you so much for watching.
