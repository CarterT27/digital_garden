https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znYThp26WJo
This is my 2018 university accommodation tour. Emmanuel College offer students guaranteed accommodation for the whole 6 years of the medical degree, which is pretty awesome. Most of the clinical medics live together in a house a stone's throw away from the hospital. Enjoy xx

## Transcript
 Hey guys, welcome back to the channel. If you're new here, my name is Ali. I'm a finally a medical student at Cambridge University and in this video I'm going to be doing a quick tour of my university room. I'm going to grab this little bad boy. We're going to get the camera off the tripod to switch it to the gimbal and I'll show you around the room. Here we go. Right, so let's begin the room tour. So we're going to start with a very quick overview of everything and then we'll look at things in more detail. So we've got a bookshelf, piano, notice board, bookshelf, desk, bed, seating area, posters, chest of drawers, music area, wardrobe. We've got some books here. We've got the Oxford Handbooks for clinical medicine. If you kind of close up magic books, a couple more medical textbooks, a little bit of camera gear, toiletries and there's little Hogwarts container. Some paraphernalia that from Japan when I went there four years ago, cheeky ugeo cards over here. Some toiletries. This is a bottle that I use every day. If you know, you know, here are some of my favorite board games. I'll take you late. Pandemic through the ages and Pandemic legacy. Moving on now, we've got this little bit with the piano, the audio interface and the little notice board at the top. So the piano doesn't actually belong to me, it belongs to a friend, but I'm just storing it in my room. And then this is the focus right to I4 audio interface, which is used for plugging in microphones and meeting controllers and guitars and stuff. Up here we've got the notice board, so few like motivational quotes, a little painting that a friend of mine made for me over Christmas last year. And a cartoon of me and two of my friends that was done a few weeks ago at a label. And of course, we've got this little fella. This is bookshelf number two. Not much interesting to see over here. I just used this as a general storage space for camera gear. We've got the drone over there. We've got some camera bags, some gorilla pods, tripod pods. Moving on, we've got the desk. I have made a video about the desk setup. So I won't talk about it in too much detail, but just quickly, this is the LG 34-inch ultra wide monitor. And it's connected via HDMI to the 2015 MacBook Pro in clamshell mode. This is the seating area. This is where we play board games or to take away do a bit of work every now and then. And then over here is the bed. And the bed is where the magic happens. And by magic, I mean sleep, which is what we use to consolidate memories that we pick up throughout the day. Over here, general chest of drawers provided by the college. Let's see if it's any. No, okay, no, it's not very tidy at all. Here's a printer. It's quite useful to have. And the B-mount crash course workbook. And on the wall, we've got some Harry Potter posters over there. And over there, we got some game of thrones posters. So those are the two sort of themes of the decor of this room. Moving on. Over here, we've got the music corner. So we have a cajon. We've got the guitar. And we've got this little amp there. Some friends and I have been using to busk around Cambridge occasionally to raise money for charity. And we've got the road NT-1A microphone for studio recordings. And it's pretty awesome. Okay, so that's it for my actual room now. Let me show you the garden and the kitchen very briefly. And then we'll wrap things up. So we are making our way to the garden. And this is the garden. The reason it's so big is that because it's kind of joined with the house next door. And both these houses are owned by manual college and their accommodation for the clinical medical students. And now just a quick tour of the rest of the house. And this is the kitchen. It's looking surprisingly clean today. It's not normally this tidy. But yeah, it's it is. We've got loads of fridges, loads of space for everyone to store their stuff. Okay, so that was the tour of my room, the garden and the rest of the house. I hope you liked it. I hear at Cambridge we're very lucky because pretty much all of the various colleges of Cambridge University provide accommodation for all undergraduates for the first three years, maybe even four years of their degree. At a manual college, we're even lucky here because in manual provides accommodation for all six years of the medical degree. But even nicer thing about manual colleges is that we get this house and the house next door. And these are like five minutes away from the hospital. So it's a very good location to be as a clinical medic. And this accommodation is available to everyone in years four, five and six of the medical course. So it's become a very nice sort of community where you're kind of with all your medic friends. And we end up doing things like everyone comes to my room and we've made friends with some of the fourth and fifth years as well as a played board games. And this sort of community feeling amongst the medics, it's something you don't get at many other colleges. So yeah, super lucky to be at Cambridge and super lucky to be specifically at a manual college. But yeah, I think we'll draw this video to a close now. Thanks very much for watching. If you like the video, please give it a thumbs up. If you haven't subscribed to the channel, please consider doing so. Have a lovely day. I'll see you in the next video. Bye bye.
