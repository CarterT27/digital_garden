## Transcript
 Hey guys welcome back to the channel. If you knew here my name is Ali, I'm a junior doctor working in Cambridge and this is the start of a new series of study with me videos which is very exciting and in these videos I'm going to be documenting my process and the long term journey of preparing for one of my postgraduate medical exams. Now I'm a doctor now but for the last six years I've been at Cambridge University Medical School, you know taking exams multiple times a year and before then A-levels before then GCSEs before then you know trying to smash those you know year 7 end of year exams and sats and stuff before then and like over this last like 15 year period I think I've personally gotten pretty good at doing exams in a fun and efficient manner because A I quite enjoy studying I think I've got a process that makes it fun and B I've got a process that makes it you know as efficient as possible in terms of you know results versus the amount of time you put in because you know I like to do all the things with my time like making videos like this so in this new series of videos I'm going to be documenting the process of preparing for the MRCOG which stands for the membership of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Now Obstetric Syncology or Obstogenic or ONG for short is the specialty that I want to go into and with every medical and surgical specialty you have to take loads of exams along the way exams don't just end when you finish medical school these exams are really quite hard they like medical school finals but take an upper notch you've got to learn a lot more niche stuff but you also have to know a lot of the basics that you would have covered in like the first and second year medical school so enough of that in this video I'm going to be giving you a brief overview kind of a broad brush stroke overview of how I intend to prepare for this exam the MRCOG and then later on in the video I'm going to share the tools that I'm currently using to prepare for this exam so hopefully whatever stage of education you're at whether you're at school college university or beyond hopefully you'll find something interesting to gain from these videos where I'll document my process of studying and share the tips and tricks that I picked up as we go along okay so let's start with the two most important fundamental principles of effective studying and I have made long videos about these they are of course active recall number one and space repetition number two and if you haven't seen my videos detailing the evidence behind these please watch those you know people have commented saying that those videos alone have changed their life and they have transformed their exam results and if you haven't seen them you really need to watch them I genuinely really really good videos please watch my videos about active recall and space repetition just to quickly summarize active recall is the idea that the more you test yourself on a subject the better you will retain the knowledge and the understanding of that subject testing yourself is not just for the exam it's also a process that you need to do throughout the whole the whole like studying process so principal number one is going to be active recall that is going to take center stage in my entire study strategy for this exam principal number two is space repetition the more you space your repetition of stuff out over time the more likely it is to stick in your long term memory I don't believe in cramming cramming is a complete myth especially that I've got like a year plus to prepare for the for this exam and it's not really just about preparing for the exam I also want to become like a good doctor and know my specialty know my subject and be the kind of person that you know you ask a question to and you know I'd hopefully be able to give a reason to answer the coaching evidence if I have to that sort of thing and space repetition is also going to play a massive part in my study technique strategy whatever you want to call it so active recall space repetitions those are going to be the two fundamental pillars that everything else is going to rest on all right broad overview the strategy is going to be split up into three phases and these phases are designed because there is such a huge amount of content to cover and you can pretty much go into unlimited detail on every topic like you know every disease could probably have its own textbook written about it but I'm not going to memorize textbooks for every single of the hundred diseases that you get in because that's a complete waste of time and completely unsustainable and yeah um so three phases of the plan phase number one is going to be to scope the subject and I think this is the most important thing in any kind of strategy for preparing for any kind of exam scope the subject work out what the broad chapters are and within those chapters what the sub topics are and then you know part of phase one is going to be a free active recall in active recall where I'm pretty much going to be trying to work out what I know about these topics already so I studied observing dining in medical school like everyone does so I will have some baseline level of knowledge about a lot of these topics so the plan in phase one is going to be to get on paper or rather on my iPad Pro which I'll talk about a little bit later on and you can watch a video up there um to get you know on you know some sort of writing device what the the content plan is for the whole subject and then write down pretty much everything I know about it already everything I understand so that I have an idea of where the holes in my knowledge are and where the biggest holes in my knowledge are so I can fill those holes first. Phase two of the plan is going to be to fill those holes but using a very big paintbrush like broad brush stroke overview I'm not going to care about the specific niche little details which is very tempting to go down the line of because you know once you start learning about polycystic ovarian syndrome you can just you know find a textbook about you know reproductive endocrine physiology and not really go deep into the evidence in the details I'm not going to be worrying about the niche stuff I'm going to focus on filling in the holes painting them in with a massive huge paintbrush such that by the end of phase two I'll pretty much know all the content from a very very basic point of view and then be able to dig down deeper and I'm hoping that by the end of phase two you know as I do practice papers and stuff like that I'll start to get towards the point where I could feasibly pass the exam quite comfortably that's kind of the aim of phase two then in phase three that's going to be when I kind of drill down into the detail in the stuff that's interesting stuff I care about you know pretty much whatever I feel like learning more about I'll learn more about because again as I said it's pretty much unlimited and this is going to be the case for a lot of your subjects especially if you're at university especially if you're studying medicine there's literally an infinite amount of stuff you could learn about everything and kind of phase three of this method is going to be that okay once I'm pretty confident that I could pass the exam if I took it now I'm going to be trying to score those final few marks that marks that hopefully get me into you know the high mark bracket range whatever you want to call it and kind of looking at papers looking at recent evidence looking at new research that sort of stuff that's going to be phase three that's going to come many many months further down the line because at the start all I care about is filling in the holes with a big ass paint brush so that's the general broad overview number one scope the subject and work out what I know already work out my starting point number two fill the holes with broad brush strokes and then number three drill deep into the details only after I've done all of the above okay now onto the fun stuff and I'm going to be talking about the tools of the trade the tools that I'm going to be using to build my study empire over the next year or so and to start with my flash card app of choice is going to be Quizlet who are the presenting sponsor for this video so thank you very much to Quizlet for agreeing to work with me this is pretty cool being sponsored by Quizlet anyway I'd considered using Quizlet for quite a while now I kind of dabbled with it a little bit in medical school for anatomy and pharmacology but mostly ended up using anky in medical school just because it's what I knew and it was fairly easy but then on quite a few of my study with me videos I got comments from students saying why don't I try Quizlet because it's got a nice design and they build this whole gamification thing into it kind of from day one which makes revising a much more pleasant and fun in using experience I kind of found with anky it was becoming a real chore to get through all my flash card decks to the point where I kind of stopped using anky and switched to my Google Sheets method which lots of you have asked about and which I'll be doing more videos onto address in a little bit more detail so yeah I lived into Quizlet it seems pretty cool I've been using it for the last few weeks so far I really like it I like the ease of use I like the design I like the game and even you know because I'm a big nerd I started reading some of their posts on their engineering blog where their data scientists have written you know statistical analyses of how they build their space for a petition algorithm and how they ensure active recoil works and I'm a real sucker for all that stuff so I think they've got a really cool team behind them that's actually doing interesting stuff that's trying to push the envelope as far as this effective studying thing goes with space repetition and active recoil which are of course the two fundamentals of effective studying so yeah Quizlet is going to be my flash card app of choice to pretty much try and learn all of the facts that I need to know I'm not a fan of using flash cards for general broad concepts I think you know trying to understand concepts and using the Feynman technique more and that a bit later about kind of being able to explain it to five year old is much more important for understanding stuff but as of the case for a lot of exams and especially the case for niche very niche postgraduate medical exams there are an absolute ton of facts that you just have to learn and an app like Quizlet is really going to help me do that I hope. Secondly I'm going to be using the trusted Google Sheets for two main purposes firstly it's going to be a tracking tool for my space repetition I'm not really going to make a revision time table instead it's going to be a retrospective revision time table meaning that I'm not going to say that you know next week I'm studying this topic the week after I'm studying this topic instead I'm going to log what I happen to have studied once I do it and once I act to recall it and again there's more information in my study with me videos but I'll be doing a more detailed video talking about how I build this retrospective revision time table using Google Sheets so that's point number one for Google Sheets and point number two is that I'm going to be using Google Sheets a little bit for active recall as well like I said earlier I'm not a fan of using flash cards for broad brush stroke concepts but I do like putting kind of broad general concepts within my Google Sheet so that if I'm looking at kind of mechanism of labor as like a topic in a tetrics for example I can immediately see what the broad topics are and then add a glance I can look at my color coding to see how well I know the topics or if I'm considering testing myself because active recall is going to be a theme all the way through as we've said a hundred times already if I'm considering testing myself then I can add a glance see that oh okay so within this chapter we've got the topic the mechanism of labor and then okay I don't know that very well what do I know about this topic and then I can cue my active free recall where I just think or explain to my friend or my housemate or write it down whatever whatever I know about that topic so Google Sheets first number one as a retrospective revision timetable and secondly as a method for active recall but again more videos coming on those a little bit later. Thirdly of course I'm going to be using my trustee iPad Pro with Apple Pencil as my primary note taking method mono taking device I'll be honest I'm not really a fan of taking notes as a form of revision I'm not really fan of summarizing however it is useful to have like you know a single source of truth for a lot of things that existing summaries are not readily available so I've made a video that's currently like 1.3 million views like by far the most popular video on this channel about how I take notes on my iPad in medical schools so you can watch that if you like that talks a lot more about how I use the iPad Pro and no-to-ability to take notes but you know this is gonna this is that I love this I use it at work every single day for my to-do list it goes with me everywhere this is going to be the ultimate revision companion along with quizzet and google sheets in fact quizzet has an amplitude which he doesn't have it's going to be on the iPad you know it's it's going to play a big part in my study method and I'll be sharing that as I go along Fourthly I'm going to be looking for sources of questions you know exam questions past paper cases that sort of stuff there's a few different online question bags for the MRCOG there's a few official ones if you're on official ones I'll be subscribing to all of those and doing as many questions as I can and I'll be getting my hands on books from libraries and from the internet and stuff that have medical cases in them you know where they give you a description of a patient and else what you do next and kind of talk you through the case so that's going to be a big part of my active recall strategy and I'm going to be doing that pretty much from day one because there's no real point in preparing for an exam if you don't know what's going to come up with the exam you might as well just like you know do the exam papers as you go along to see track your progress as a start I'm pretty sure I'm not going to be getting very good marks but I'm hoping that as time goes on my marks will steadily improve as I acquire more knowledge and understanding of the specialty which is quite exciting and finally I'm going to be using some textbooks yes I know I've talked a bit in previous videos about how I've already done like textbooks for medical school exams and the reason I don't like them for medical school exams is that I think they're far too detailed and you don't really need that detail to do really well in medical school exam medical school exams are more about you know just getting a very broad understanding of everything rather than a deep specific understanding of some things whereas now we're at the postgraduate level where a lot of the information is unfortunately tied up in textbooks or tied up within like research papers that are hard to access on the internet so I'm going to be having to use textbooks especially in phase three of the plan where I'm going to be digging deeper into each of these topics you know just using Wikipedia is no longer going to cut it even though it used to for medical school so yeah textbooks are unfortunately of but you know excitingly going to pay play some part in my study technique over the coming year so let's wrap up that was the method um broad overview of the three phases and we talked about the five different tools of the trade that I'm going to be using to build this study empire over the coming year this is going to be quite exciting um preparing for this exam is quite a tricky endeavor it's supposed to be quite a hard exam the pass rate is quite low so I'm hoping that you know I will be amongst the people that pass it and I kind of want to do really well eight in the exam but be also because it's not just about doing well in the exam anymore this is about being a good doctor and knowing for my specialty and I want to be the kind of doctor that knows this specialty well I don't want to be a waste man doctor so there's a lot riding on this it's going to be fun I'm working full time as a doctor and part time as youtuber alongside so it's really going to be a test of how efficiently can I study you know how can I get the both the best bang for my buck in terms of acquiring knowledge and understanding in return for the smallest amount of time invested as possible so it's going to be fun and I'm hoping to bring you guys along for the journey if you'd like to follow along it would be really cool so thank you very much for watching I hope you found this video useful I hope you picked up some interesting things that you can learn along the way and stay tuned for our next week where there's going to be the first like legit study with me video I've got a day off work like next Friday so I'm going to be spending that whole day studying scoping up my subject and we'll invite some friends over dinner at the end you know the usual study with me style I throw back to the you know the good old university days so thank you very much for watching if you like the video please give it a thumbs up if you haven't subscribed to the channel please consider doing so thanks again to Quizlet for sponsoring this video and I will see you guys in the next video good night
