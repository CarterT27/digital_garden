 Hello everyone, welcome back to the vlog. We are in the CotsWords and it's the Christmas holidays but you're probably seeing this in the new year. So happy new year. So we're just walking through the CotsWords. We've got an amazing Airbnb rented out and very excitingly we've brought the drone along on this trip.

It's a good time and it's hanging out. Guys, if you've got a chance to get back in. Hi guys, it's day two last night. It was great. We had an amazing vegan Christmas dinner, courtesy of the sea. And then, because it was the last night of Hanukkah, we listened candles and we played this like Hanukkah game and sang Hanukkah songs and things courtesy of Abbey. Today we're going off on this very long one mile walk and we're going to fly the drone to try and improve our skills out flying the drone. We're going to fly the drone and we're going to fly the drone and we're going to fly the drone. We're going to fly the drone. Who knows? Do you know him? No. He's a famous guy and I think my missileologist. What's fanbeck? Public health session we had that was all about fanbecks? No. I think that was just you. All right, so we are now at the end of our wonderful trip to the Cotsworld. This has been really, really good fun. We have done some very cute things. We've had a vegan Christmas dinner.
