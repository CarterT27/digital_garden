## Transcript
 Hello everyone today. We are going to go to Raffles Hotel, which is apparently really fancy hotel somewhere in the capital city And we're going to spend a few hours by the poolside doing some work on our laptops So here we are outside the hotel and I don't know if you can see behind me, but it looks pretty big Whoa Double swimming pool Poolside menu Raffles Hotel and the Royal In Cambodia We're trying to decide whether it's worth eating here or if it's a little bit faster Yeah, this place is pretty sick We definitely see ourselves spending a whole day here just kind of working by the pool And diving in occasionally So we just found out actually that if we want to stay here and use the pool We've got a kind of 30 dollars per person Which is different anymore than we were expecting The other hotel we went to has a really nice pool was four dollars per person So we might just end up going there instead Yes, we just charge the guy and we've pretended to be quite confused And he went to check for the manager and apparently we can use the pool for free Which is quite exciting Oh my god, his food is absolutely incredible We don't have a doubt initially We call it that you know any place charging ten fifteen dollars per food is going to give you some tiny portion sizes and stuff We're very good, but then they brought the food out and it's pretty awesome It's amazing It's amazing The water is with warm and it's lovely and it's just the most perfect temperature as well Yeah Although it has to just start to break Hello again We've just ordered the afternoon tea, the Cambodian version of it We feel like maybe this tea wasn't supposed to have milk in it, but oh well Yeah, I'm pretty sure I was green tea So we have the exotic fruit butter We have the savory secret which is we potato and taro persis Biced fried prawns and rubbed chicken on skewers I don't know which part of the chicken to be roast But it sounds really delicious But there's the steamed layered rice flour And then we have the steamed pumpkin cake And then the ripe mango and coconut crack And that must be a really good opportunity That wasn't really good opportunity Would highly recommend if anyone that's Cambodian the new future And so ends our experience of hanging out by the pool side of this five star hotel But now we're going to go downtown to a coffee shop But the lattes are cheaper than seven dollars each So thanks for sticking around for the ride Would highly recommend this place if you ever come to Cambodian When the lamp is five dollars Yes, that's why It's them, you know, it's them fray, you know It's them Why, I've seen it again Yeah, it's always so easy Five is too much, mate, sorry Four, it's four Three, fifty I've seen it in my foot I've seen it in my foot I've seen it in my foot Yeah, don't play on my foot No choice, don't play on my foot Okay, three fifty Okay, three fifty, right, let's go Thank you
