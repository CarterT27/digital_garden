## Transcript
 Hey guys, welcome back to the channel. If you're new here, my name is Ali. I'm a junior doctor working in Cambridge and in this video I'm going to be sharing my thoughts about the non-academic side of university and overall why I think the experience is very much worthwhile. The reason behind this video is that this is organization called Universities UK that represents 137 of the universities in the UK which is probably like the vast majority of them and they reached out a few weeks ago and asked me to make a video where I talk about my experiences of being at that university and this is something that I would happily talk about for hours on end so I thought why not make a video about it. So, big thank you for universities UK for being kind enough to sponsor this video and then at the end we'll talk a little bit about a competition that they're running where you basically send in a photo and you can win an iPhone XS which is all very exciting. So yeah let's talk about the non-academic side of university and I kind of want to focus on two points. Firstly I want to talk about the personal development side and then I want to talk a little bit about like the social collaboration side of being at university. Then at the end I'll share my thoughts about why I think the whole experience is worth it and as always there's going to be timestamps to each of these sections in the video description. So you know you can skip around if that's what you're into or you can just watch the whole video or whatever you like. So let's start with the personal development side. For most people universities obviously going to be the first time that you kind of strike off on your own the first time you're away from home having to do your own laundry, having to cook your own meals. I say these last two points because that wasn't really the case for me. I went to Emmanuel College Cambridge or some place where they do your laundry for you and there's no there aren't really any cooking facilities when you're in college accommodation. So most people tend to have most of their meals in the cafeteria, the dining hall where there's pretty reasonable and very reasonably priced food that's made by the award-winning kitchen staff. So yeah for most people you will probably learn to cook and do your own laundry at university but my personal development on that front was slightly stunted but that's fine because there's so many other benefits of university. From a personal development side I think one of the main things that university gives you is that it's the first time that you are truly in charge of your own time. Like before you and when you're at school your time is quite rigidly set out for you and yeah you're hours between 4pm and 11pm or whatever are pretty much your own but if you have home work and you've got exams and if you've got the sort of parents that made you do tons and tons of extra-curricular activities or if you decided yourself to do tons and tons of extra-curricular activities that's generally very structured time and university is the first time where you're going to have like large swaths, swaths, swaths of unstructured time where you can pretty much do whatever the hell you want. There's lots of different ways of spending this time for some people they end up getting really into World of Warcraft or Overwatch or you know Fortnite these days and end up essentially kind of using I don't want to say wasting but using all the university time playing video games and that's fine if that's what you're into. For other people they get involved in different societies they pick up new hobbies new skills as a stuff I don't at university personally so in my second year I took up the guitar and my third year I took up the piano I joined like two different choirs singing troupe for the for the hospital pantomime so I kind of developed my musical interest at university and it was quite nice like I didn't really learn piano or guitar from a specific joining a society point of view but it was more the fact that I had all this unstructured time and like if you have a two-hour gap between you're morning and afternoon lecture you might as well spend that time learning how to play river flows in you so that when you go to the grand arcade which is the Cambridge shopping centre you can see on the piano and bust out classic tune that get kind of Chinese tourists kind of filming you on their first but you know what we're talking about yeah person development that unstructured time you can pretty much spend it however you want and I think it takes people a while to get into this like when I was in my first year I did not use my time that efficiently but as I got through university I began to realise that actually I've got so much spare time and I can use it to do all these various things and I don't think I would have got that experience had had not been for university also from a person development standpoint for me anyway university was the first time that I actually had female friends I went in all boys grammar school in south and on sea and didn't really I wasn't really cool enough to be in the kind of group of kids that would hang out kind of by the girl school over lunch time and I didn't take the bus home so I didn't make friends that way and I just like it just ended up being me and my guy friends pretty much for the whole seven years we had some girls in six form but again I feel like I wasn't cool enough to really be close friends with any of them and then I got to university and then suddenly my friendship group became like 50 50 boy girl ratio and that was really interesting it was interesting because firstly you taught me how to talk to girls which is something that like you know it's it's just like surprising your heart to do and then you kind of do it and you're like okay this is not so bad um I feel like I viewed girls there's almost being another species but then after a while I realised that actually these guys aren't so bad um I was also quite hormonal in my first year and ended up falling in love I think and then you know feeling all those kind of like heartbreaking sort of emotions and all that all that stuff and I feel like university is kind of a good time to experience those also in terms of rejection so university was really the first time I'd have been seriously rejected like not just romantically but also in in other things like you know I'd applied to things and I didn't get them which was unusual because generally when I was in school I would apply for stuff and get it um it was also the first time I found myself not automatically being like in the top few people in the class which was an interesting experience I remember the first SI got back where I got 54% in this how to how to bones grow essay and I was absolutely shocked because 54% that's like that's good you know I was so used to getting marks in the 90s without putting much effort in at school then to suddenly be kind of taken down many many pegs uh really did wonders for my own personal development because it helped me lose almost the arrogant streak that I developed while I was at school thinking that it was also easy and then I realised I actually had to do some work and put some effort in which overall benefited me a lot I also think in terms of rejection like when you start applying for things and you don't get them by default I think that really helps you grow as a person because it helps you realise that actually you know the worst case scenario isn't so bad and rejection isn't so bad and you might as well apply for stuff so like in my in my third year I applied to go to Harvard for a year that would have been pretty awesome a friend of mine did that he had an absolutely incredible experience but I didn't get it I got beaten out by people that were better qualified or just had better applications or whatever and that was a good thing from like a personal development standpoint because you know the world moved on and it didn't really matter at the end of the day and I think that's a good lesson to learn very early in life okay so that's it from a personal development standpoint I could literally talk about this for hours but I want this video to be semi manageable so let's end it there let's talk a little bit now about the collaborators that you would get at university and I say collaborators rather than friends like obviously you make friends at university you make great friends you have fantastic times you go on holiday together you go on club societies you play sports together you sing songs together that's all like kind of the friendship side of things but that's like not particularly I don't know it's not particularly novel I think everyone kind of knows that you make good friends at university but I want to focus a bit about collaborators because I think university is probably the best time in your life where you get have the potential to meet people that you can work with like collaborate with on stuff for the rest of your life so using me as an example at university I said a company called sixmed in collaboration with some friends that I'd made at university and we'd worked together to set this company up and actually some school friends as well people with that at university but we worked together to set this company up to make all the course materials for our beam at you kick out interview courses all of this stuff and I think the company was success because of the fact that it was a collaboration between so many students and so many friends secondly this YouTube channel benefited a lot from having kind of collaborators having my friends come on it and give the tips about medicine interviews all that sort of stuff towards the beginning so like from that point of view at university you get to meet people who are pretty much the same age as you you know have very similar interest to you or you can find people who have similar interest to you and therefore you can end up working together a lot of the time and then to use the example of my brother as well so he studied maths Oxford and while he was there he made these three friends and at the moment they're all in America he literally moved there like two weeks ago they're in America instead of can value working on a startup just the four of them all mates from university and this company's doing really well and I remember something my brother said to me a few years ago he said that he he he pointed to a few people in his in his collage and he said that these are people that I think could be lifelong collaborators with me I think that's a really nice position to be and like where you've got this group of friends who aren't just friends but who are also people that you can see yourself working with so for me for example if I have another idea for a company I've got in mind you know a handful of people that I met through university that I would you know in a heartbeat you know message about it talked talk them about it you know should really wish our ideas and if they were interested I'd want them to join the team and then we become this like you know group of friends working on this thing together and I think that's just a really cool thing and actually it seems like quite a few of the consultants at Adam Brooks the hospital where I work at quite a few of the consultants know the other consultants because they were all at university together and they somehow you know ended up in Cambridge working together and I think that's just really cool they'll go around each other's houses for like parties and go to dinner together and I think you know this thing of making friends as well as collaborators is something that you uniquely get at university and I can't really think of many other environments you're surrounded by such a tight new group of people who are likely to share such similar interest to you where you can make this sort of thing happen all right so talk a little bit about personal development and like love life and stuff and I talked a little bit about collaboration overall you know obviously there's the academic side of university you do a degree you know for the sake of it whatever but this video is about the non academic side and the question is is university worth it and that was the question that university's UK kind of wanted me to answer and I think if we're deciding whether anything is worth it we have to think about what the cost is what is the cost of this experience that you get there's only really two costs in at least in the UK to going to university the first one is time and the second one is money now time is kind of a no brainer because you know everyone says that university is supposed to be the best time of your life and I can't really think of a better use of time like I can't think of a better way to spend six years of my life than to do medicine I came bridge I think it was an absolutely incredible experience time is not really a factor like the time is absolutely worth the experience that you get at university now what about money now this is the point where where people generally cite you know oh but the tuition fees are 9,000 pounds or higher and you know I don't want to be riddled with student loans for the rest of my life but you know at least from from my experience the way that student finances that up in the UK I mean it's not that you really have to pay much of your own money up front you get your student loan which covers all the tuition fees you get your you know no questions asks maintenance grant which covers a lot of your expenses if you're from a lower income background you get loads of bursaries if you go to particularly universities like Cambridge has a fantastic bursary system for you know students from low income backgrounds you end up being able to fund pretty much your entire university studies just off the money that you get given from by the government and by the universities and yeah then you do have a lot of money and student loans but it's not really alone in that you only start paying it back once you start earning above a certain threshold and for my year that threshold was 21,000 pounds and beyond that you start paying 9% of everything you earn and that's fine because it's in a way it's like a graduate tax it's like you know I've gone to university I've got this degree this degree has helped me get this job this job pays you know more than the median salary in the UK therefore I'm going to give 9% of my earnings beyond that point to the government to pay back for my my thing so it's not like in the US and other systems where you feel like you're saddled with 150,000 dollars of debt and then you have to pay back because you've got these banks and companies chasing you it's more like yeah if you go to high paying job then you pay an extra tax which is fine so like at least the way it was when I was at university money was not really an issue and for pretty much everyone I know kind of in my cohort and a few years above and below money wasn't really an issue because we have such a fantastic system of student finance apologies to all the international students who have to fork out their fees themselves yeah money is an issue for you guys so like overall time 100% worth it and money it's not really a cost that you see you see that cost you know a few years down the line once you're earning money so again I think the experience is 100% worth it so yeah in conclusion we've talked a little bit about the personal development side of university like kind of not academically we talked about the fact that you make friends who then also become collab can become collaborators for the rest of your life and I pretty much said that yeah it's worth the time and it's worth the money because you know the time is you know you can't really be doing anything better with your time and money wise it's more a graduate tax rather than you know money you pay up front at least that's what it was in in my cohort so yeah thanks very much university's UK for sponsoring this video I just want to tell you a little bit about a competition that they're running now this is a competition where it closes on
