## Transcript
 Hey guys, welcome back to the channel. If you're new here, my name is Ali and I'm now a junior doctor working in the UK And today was actually my very first day on the job and I'm pretty exhausted But quite excitingly this channel recently hit 50,000 subscribers So thank you so much If you are a subscriber, loads of you sent in questions via Instagram DM And there were about 120 questions in total that people sent in So I've categorized these questions into various categories And I'm gonna be going over each one of the categories in a different video This part is gonna be about life advice So we're gonna be discussing a handful of themes regarding life advice And as always you'll find links to timestamps of all these themes in the video description So let's just jump into it and the first series of questions relates to time management So how do you manage your time energy? How do you find the time to do so many things? How do you balance everything's like friendship, study social life in general Thank you very much for the questions I get asked this a lot about time management and I have a few thoughts on this So firstly, I think it's really important to recognise that you are fully in control of your own time for the most part So I never ever like to use the phrase I don't have time And anytime I even think of I don't have time I always do my best to reframe it in my head As I am choosing not to make the time for whatever So as a first step recognising that you're fully in control of your time And then what you choose to do in your time is entirely down to you Secondly, I think I like to incorporate space repetition And I've made a whole video about this about how space repetition can be used when preparing for exams But I think space repetition this idea that you do a little bit one day And then maybe the next day and then maybe a few days later after that This is going to apply to pretty much any other hobby as well So let's see you want to teach yourself the piano with a guitar or singing or skateboarding or whatever Like literally anything You can do like ten minutes one day, twenty minutes and next day And then like a few days later do another twenty minutes And then over time when you apply patience and consistency To all of these different domains of your life You realise that actually after about a year You're pretty good at quite a lot of different things And then you get people asking your questions like Oh, how do you do so much for your time? How are your time management skills this the other? And to address the question of balance in terms of balancing everything I think it's important to have sort of a priority list And in my own personal priority list Studies was always kind of at the bottom of the list So everything else that I had to do in my life What I wanted to do in my life would come above studying But then studying would become kind of the default option So if you've played any like role playing video games like in World of Warcraft There are some classes that you know you have like ten different attacks Or moves that you can use And you have a sort of priority list that you know Once every twenty second you can use like a venting wrath And then once every ten seconds you can use like crusader shield Or whatever it's called But then like you go down the priority list When nothing else is available that's when you use your basic attack And for me studying was my basic attack in that Whenever there was nothing else going on I'd be studying And I found that this was quite a good way of always having something to do Okay, the next question relates to stress And tooth fairy acts how do you personally deal with stress Apart from the conventional playing sports and reading etc More on a psychological and emotional level And on a related note Sravvia B says what is your best advice for keeping your healthy mind When you have exams or stress I don't really get very stressed at all Like I can count on one hand the number of times I've felt stressed And I think partly it's because I really like this philosophy of stoicism Which I'll there be loads of links in the description That's a really good book that I always recommend called Happy by Darren Brown And also the I think it's called like the ancient guide to stoic joy Or something like that by William Irvine They will appear on the side over here My hands magically I hope The philosophy of stoicism is kind of based on two main principles The first one is that whenever we feel a negative emotion It's not external events that directly cause that negative emotion It is our response to those external events It is the story we tell ourselves about the external events So when it comes to having a lot of things to do One story we can tell ourselves is I've got so many things that I have to absolutely do I don't think I've got the time to do it Therefore you know that story leads to this feeling of overwhelm Whereas if we just kind of slightly reframe it as I've got these things to do Alright, it is what it is I'm going to do these things The feeling bad about having this stuff to do Which is what I interpret as stress That just never really comes into the equation So it's more like things are as they are Okay, I'm going to do them and my own feelings about doing them Just never go into the mix So that's point number one And point number two is you know the classics around you pray God grant me the serenity to accept that which I cannot change The courage to change what I can and the wisdom to know the difference And I think that's just like the ultimate Like way of living life So most things in life are going to lie outside our direct sphere of control Direct sphere of influence except for two things And that is our own actions We are fully for the most part in control of our own actions And secondly our own thoughts that we can arguably control our thoughts With enough practice with a few caveats that I'm not going to go into right now So if the only things that I can control are my own thoughts and my own actions Then everything else that's happening in the world Does not need to concern me and I find that like Especially when I'm talking to a lot of my friends who do Feel the kind of stress or a negative emotional response To external events It tends to be that they worry about stuff that they just can't control Whereas if all you worry about are your own thoughts and your own actions Then I think that is a pretty good way of living a stress free life So those hopefully that answer the question about psychological and emotional tactics for dealing with stress All right Eyes eyes, what do you tell yourself after you're having a bad day or screw up something after working so hard So let's tackle the screw up something after working so hard I think like the way I like to think about this is that I would work hard at stuff But I would do my very best to not let the outcome affect my emotional state So in a way it's a form of pessimism in that is having such low expectations Like for example, I've recently released an online BMAT video of course If you're taking the BMAT and applying for medicine you might like to check it out The link in the description so I recently released that and I spent about three or four days working on it And like really put my heart into making the series of like 70 plus amazing videos about how to smash this exam And even though I've worked so hard at this I still have the expectation that okay It would be nice if maybe three or four people bought access to this course and then I made a bit of money on the side And that's quite like a low that's that's setting quite a low bar and therefore What was the question again? Oh, oh you screw up something after working so hard I think if I was thinking that oh I want a thousand people to you know pay for this like online course that I've done And then I worked really hard at it then having that high expectation means that I would feel bad for screwing it up But because my expectation is so low and I'm working on it because it's fun and because I think it's a good thing to do anyway Then the outcome doesn't really play a part and again this falls back to the same thing about things that we can control versus things we can't control The outcome of where there anyone buys my course is something completely outside of my control What's in my control are my own thoughts about it and my own actions the actions that I've controlled is putting effort into it and the thoughts are having a low expectation So that is why I don't really feel bad when something goes wrong because the expectations are quite low If that makes sense and the next bit of the question was what do you tell yourself when you're having a bad day? I honestly can't I really can't remember the last time I had a bad day And I think again going back to this dose is something having a bad day like days for the most part like you know borrowing major calamities and stuff aside Well let's put all that aside and let's just think about cases in everyday life where you know life and death is not in the balance Where we might say we're having a bad day and usually I think when people are having a bad day It's because they've been feeling particularly stressed about lots of stuff going on Someone is a bit mean to them the consultant on their ward didn't like you know shout at them a bit Again all of these are external events and like stoicism tells us It's not the external events that are making us have a bad day It is the story we're telling us about the external events So consultant chances are over the phone because we've made a bad request One person might interpret that as okay cool I'm learning from this kind of the growth mindset and the other person might interpret that as oh my god A consultant shouted at me. I feel like such a failure I'm going to be a terrible doctor and would therefore have a bad day because of this So obviously this doesn't apply to everything and it does take practice And I'm deliberately not talking about very deep things where it's okay to have a bad day And you don't really need to tell yourself like yeah It's something major majorly bad happens in your life Then it's okay to have a bad day. That's fine But you know if you want to have fewer bad days Then I think for me what's worked is just having this idea of it's not the event that is making me feel bad It is my story about the event and therefore in order to not feel bad about it All I have to do is change my story and you know when I want to check and dinner Bob's your uncle as they say Okay Daniel asks after not so successful first year how can I learn from my mistakes and do better next year? The main thing I struggle with is being consistent with the vision throughout the year Especially if it's a complex subject or something completely new to me Okay, so this is about learning from mistakes and doing better next year And also you know, I think it's important to define for ourselves this idea of success You know getting a first class degree getting top of the year is not the be all in and all As much as it might seem initially like if you think back to yourself in like you know five years ago six years ago When you were like starting secondary school or wherever And you like you can imagine like a lot of us I was quite stressed about my exam results in year seven, but now I look back on that I think why I know it was I stressed about my exam results in year seven And he just doesn't make any sense to And equally I think this thing if you project yourself ten years from now and ask will this matter in ten years time I think that alone is the way to not feel bad about a lot of things But your question was about how can I learn from my mistakes and do better next year And you're struggling with being consistent with the vision throughout the year It's a complex subject or something completely new to you So I think you should watch all my my revision videos about that space repetition act of recoil I just by far the most efficient techniques for revision doing this thing of scoping your subject as Paul would say Where you're taking your big complicated subject and you're breaking it down into a series of manageable topics So A level chemistry on it was on its own seems like a really big deal But when you split it up you realize it's only 15 topics And if you can do one topic a day you're doing the whole syllabus every two weeks And when you break it down like that and realize that oh, okay, this is actually a manageable series of topics Then I think at least at least for me that works as a way of getting myself to do a little bit each day Also I think when we sit down to do work or to revise or to study or anything like that And our goal is to do some chemistry then I don't think that's a very good goal because it's it's it can just get so overwhelming and you just don't know where to start Whereas if the goal is I am going to you know go over my active recoil questions for Chapter five in chemistry and that is our goal for the day and that's a very easy goal and that's you know It's it's it's a goal that we we know how to achieve it. We know where to start We're making life easy for ourselves because you know, it's a it's a simple manageable goal rather than you know This big overarching goal of revising chemistry So that's what I would say scope your subjects split it down into manageable chunks and then make your goals very very directed and easy to achieve Yeah, hopefully that's useful Leant asks, what is the greatest change you've seen from yourself these past few years? I think these past few years especially being at university. I really developed over our rather I've improved at this general idea of not really caring what people think I'm starting a YouTube channel And bringing a camera to lectures occasionally and to holidays and stuff Even vlogging in public sometimes when I put putting my face on the internet It has required a lot of I don't care what people think And partly that comes from recognizing that most people just don't care like even all of the 200 people that were in my year of med school Like maybe three or four of them would have even given a second thought to me holding a camera out in the middle of the medical student Tonka in the in the middle of the medical student common room the vast majority We're just looked on and think okay cool and moved on with the lives because everyone is concerned about their own lives No one is wasting their own time thinking about you I think in a way it is like one thing that I've learned is that it's quite Self-centered to think that other people are even thinking of you everyone's just you know doing their own doing their own stuff So that's probably the biggest thing that I've taken away from these last few years at university I also think that while I've been at university my confidence levels have increased doing stuff like this has helped Doing loads of societies taking part in different sports trying new things back when I was in school I don't think I was very confident person generally because my identity was just wrapped up in just being really academic And I didn't really have much else going for me But when I sort of started to grow older and got to university and a tried to try and tried my best to dissociate my identity My feelings of self-esteem from these external things like academics firstly and secondly recognizing that you know It's that's like an ideal state and that we all ultimately do have our identity tied up in lots of different things I just happened to have tied my identity in a like a vast number of things over time because I like this thing of learning How to to be pretty good at a lot of different things rather than just really good at a handful of that very small number of things So in a very kind of run-around about our city of question I suppose the main thing I've learned these last few years is eight into like care a lot less about what other people think Because for the most part most people just don't care at all and secondly becoming more confident by having my identity wrapped up in more Or rather not even wrapped up having my identity dependant on fewer things as it were If that makes sense like I don't know maybe I'll do a bit about this at some point But yeah, that's that's that will do for now Nicole X in tongue says if you go to turn back time and meet your younger self, what advice would you give him? As does anyone said if you could go back and time what advice would you give to your younger self This is a pretty classic question that comes up in podcasts and Tim Ferriss show the Tim Ferriss show one of my favorite podcasts of all time Which is incredible if you want to learn how to just become a more A complex and powerful person generally This is a question he likes to ask you so he says to his guests if you could go back ten years What would you tell yourself and a lot of the guests have said pretty much the same thing which is I honestly honestly I'll probably wouldn't tell myself anything because you know the reason I am where I am today is because of what I did when I was younger And if I had told myself to do something else, I might not necessarily be where I am today So honestly, I don't really think I would give myself any more The kind of any advice about changing my own direction in life I suppose I would tell myself to I don't know, just be it a little bit nicer to people I think kindness goes a long way I think when I was younger, especially I in a way took pride with maybe being a bit more on the arrogant side If you being like rude to people sometimes thinking that it was cool thinking that Sometimes even thinking that they were beneath me in a way And yeah, this is all really bad stuff So probably tell myself that mate, you know, you want to grow up a bit, just be nice to people Because when you're nice to people people think you're nice and that's just it's just generally nice to be nice So that's what I would tell my younger self Alright moving on Nicole again asks, what are your favourite quotes? I love this question Okay, so I'm a big fan of collecting quotes I've mentioned the serenity prayer already God grant me the serenity to accept that which I cannot change the courage to change what I can and the wisdom to know the difference I think that's really important Secondly, I'm kind of alluded to this This is a quote often attributed to Elana Roosevelt who I think was Teddy Roosevelt's wife And she says that you will stop caring what other people think of you When you realize how seldom they do That's another classic And finally just off the top of my head There's a really good article that I've returned to many times a year about motivation And the title of this is something that I return to a number of times And that is screw motivation What you need is discipline And this article talks about how Just because you don't feel like doing something Doesn't mean you can't do that something And it's like phrase nice really article I'll link it down below But that is a quote that I always often think of Whenever I think like for example today I've come back from a long day Like the shift lasted two hours more than it was supposed to Because of various external factors I got home and I was like, I really can't be bothered to make this With this YouTube video But you know, just for the feel like doing it It doesn't mean I can't do it And indeed here I am sitting here making the YouTube video Because I set up the camera and I was like, oh, I don't feel like it So I had a few different techniques But ultimately, you know, not feeling like doing something Is not a good enough reason for not doing it Especially when kind of the long term Overroaching like purpose is is good And you especially like with this video I'll know that like it's quite fun doing it I quite like the sound of my own voice And sort of seeing myself on camera It's a little bit weird But it's quite fun making the video And then when it comes out I know that it might be helpful to some people Usually people comment nice things and message me nice things So I know that overall I will benefit from making this video that you're watching But even though I don't feel like doing it initially I'd try and override that So those are just three quotes that come to mind And actually this has got me thinking about those things So I've been reading loads of books on Kindle these past five years And I really justly highlight interesting lines that I find So I might just do like a series of videos Where I talk about quotes from the Kindle Where we talk through loads of different books And I talk through some of my favorite quotes from each of these various books So let me know in the comments if that's something that you might like to see But now let's move on to the final question I'm an aspiring doctor going into my freshman year of college What is the best piece of advice you could give me? The sparring doctor going to freshman year of college Okay, so it's probably some kind of American system going on So I imagine you're doing like four years of college And then you're maybe applying to medical school Or maybe from the UK you call in college six forms So you're just doing this two years of high school It doesn't matter Best piece of advice I can give you is to try and make yourself different And there is another quote that I like Like I came across in a book which is It's better to be the only rather than the best Or words to that effect And the idea is that if you're in a class of your own If you're in your own category Where you're able to combine lots of different things To create this to carve out this interesting little niche for yourself And whatever you're doing, whether it's medicine or law or economics or programming or being a youtuber or whatever If you can carve out this niche for yourself that so few other people are in Then you're automatically winning Whereas if you're trying to be the best, which is a lot of a way Which a lot of people are trying to And the best traditionally you find is getting the best grades Getting the most competitive like jobs That becomes a very stressful to use that word Way of living where you're constantly competing against other people And I would say like the Or what I am almost glad for that I have ever done in my life Is teaching myself web design and learning how to code Because those two things Even within medicine have opened up so many doors for me Much more than the fact that I've got pretty good grades at school And then fairly average grades at university Because it's just insane the amount of doors that are open for me Because of my web design skills Because I can make PowerPoint presentation look pretty Because I have these other things that add to my medical degree and add to my medical stuff That in a way lets me carve out my own path And therefore anything I do benefits from having all these different areas Feeding into it So if you are starting a college or pretty much any stage of your life And you're coming to me for advice And what I would say is try and make yourself more well-rounded And I don't know if people say well-rounded Because well-rounded has this connotation of I'm doing lots of sports so that I can get into university I don't know I do sports because you enjoy them Not because they're getting into university But if you can pick up skills that will compound in addition to your main line Things like public speaking, photography, design, video editing Just to name a few things on the top of my head I'm sure there's loads of others These things can combine with almost any field And then you can create something interesting and unique for yourself Within that field Even within medicine There are so many doctors around the world You don't just want to be a doctor Or if you do that's fine But then you probably don't need my advice Because you've got the path set out In front of you, you know what you have to do You just need to get good grades, be nice to your patients And you'd be a pretty great doctor But if you're interested in maybe doing something a little bit different Then I would say I biggest advice is to work on extra things that you can feed into your medical career Ultimately, 10, 20 years down the line Don't think in the short term Think like very, very long term And think how might this benefit me And even if you can't work with that Like I would have had no idea that learning how to make websites Would have helped me as much in medicine as it has But it's just literally It's just insane how that one skill has just absolutely transformed And pretty much every project I've done with in medicine Just to make it so much better So yeah, I think we'll end it there That's probably my best advice I'll send that you enjoy yourself Don't work too, I don't work too hard You know people enjoy working hard to do what you enjoy Do what's worthwhile Read a lot, it's fun to read I'll be my advice Yeah, hopefully that's useful So this has been a series of life advice questions This has been fairly rambly Apologies, this was rambly Let me know what you think of the format I've just pretty much sat in front of the camera Set up a light over there Microphone up there camera over there And I'm just kind of talking to it And I've just been talking to myself for how far What is it now? Wow 27 minutes, that's a very long time I've got to cut this video down to less than 27 minutes Ideally, but let me know what you think of this format Hopefully I've answered some questions that have been useful for you guys The next bit of the Q&A is going to be about personal questions So loads of you asked various personal things About like my girlfriend And about my goals in life And about just like other things So that will be the next Q&A But yeah, thank you very much for watching If you liked the video, please give it a thumbs up If you haven't subscribed to the channel yet, please consider doing so Have a lovely day And I'll see you in the next video Goodbye
