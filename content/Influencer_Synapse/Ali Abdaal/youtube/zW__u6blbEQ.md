## Transcript
 So I've been looking for a new daily driver laptop for quite a while and after the years of waiting, it's finally here. This is the brand new M1 2020 MacBook Pro, and this is the laptop that I'm not going to be carrying around with me everywhere I go. Hey friends, welcome back to the channel. If you're new here, my name is Aleya. I'm a doctor based in Cambridge and nothing is more exciting for a productivity nerd like me than switching laptops and honestly, I think this is going to be a huge improvement for my quality of life and mental wellbeing. This is for now the perfect laptop that I'm going to be switching to. And in this video, I'm going to go over all of the things I love about the new MacBook Pro and try and review it somewhat extensively, despite only having it for a little while and explain why I'm switching to it as my daily driver. As usual, timestamps in the video description and in a pinned comment so do feel free to skip around the video if you feel like it but now let's just dive into it. So as usual, because I like to start with upfront conclusions, here is the top line summary in case you don't have very long. And the top line summary is that this laptop is absolutely amazing. It's got blazing fast performance, it's got absolutely ridiculous battery life. It's got a keyboard that's best in class that track pad that's pretty amazing. It only has two ports but that's not a big deal and it is a small and light and reasonably portable design that I can just take with me everywhere I go. That is why I love this. That's why I'm switching to it as my daily driver from this huge ass 2018-15-inch MacBook Pro, which is a real pain in the bump to carry around. Diving more into details, let's start with the design and possibility. So this design, honestly, has not really changed much. It's the same design they've had on the MacBook Pro for the last several years. It is pretty thin, it's pretty light and if you stick it on a set of scales, it weighs 1,338 grams which I think is identical to my iPad Pro. It is basically identical. There's a 1,360 grams, this is 1,380 grams. It is basically the same way and they feel exactly the same and I've been carrying this 4.9-inch iPad Pro with Magic Keyboard and Apple Pencil around with me basically all year. But now I can carry that in addition to this because there are some things that the iPad is good for but there are a lot of things that are MacBook is good for. In terms of design, unlike the MacBook Air, you do not get the wedge. This is just a pure sort of slab. It feels nice, it feels good, you know, if you're going to have a little one-hand and the screen turns automatically on. Thanks to the new M1 chip which we're going to talk about in just a sec. Let's talk portability now. Now this is a 13-inch laptop and I've been carrying around a 15-inch laptop for the last two years because this is very specced out and it's one of those really annoying things where if I was going to my mum's place for the weekend or if I was traveling or going on a trip, I would always feel the need to take my huge-ass 15-inch MacBook Pro around with me. Just in case I needed to edit a video or edit a podcast, I would just do something that required a proper computer rather than an iPad because and I'm going to make a proper video exploring this in-depth. I still don't think an iPad, even an iPad Pro, even a 12.9-inch iPad Pro. For me, I don't think it can feasibly replace what a laptop does for me. And so I would have to carry my iPad and take my laptop. Every time I would put this into my bag, I would sigh thinking, oh, I really wish I had a small, like, 13-inch, like, very, very powerful machine that I could just use as my portable machine and now it's finally here. And so from now on basically, this is going to go with me everywhere I go and I'm probably actually going to replace this with the new M1 Mac Mini review on that coming in a little while. I'll be linked up there once it's out and then I'll have like a permanent Mac Mini base to set up for my desk and then I'll just be able to carry this around with me if I'm going to somewhere for the weekend or if I'm going to a coffee shop or even if I'm just sitting on the sofa or trying to work on the balcony, this will be absolutely perfect rather than having to like this thing around. Secondly, let's talk about the processor and this is absolutely huge news this year in the last week or so. Previously, all of the Apple laptops were based around Intel chips and so Apple would buy the chips from Intel and it would be like a Intel i9 and 8 core, whatever a 3.2GHz processor, blah blah blah blah. Now what's happening is that Apple have switched away from Intel and have started designing their own chips for the Mac. They've been doing this for years, well, pretty much from day one with the iPhone and the iPad, which is why when you have an iPad and you tap something, it's just ridiculously fast, which is why iPhones feel ridiculously fast and Apple does the thing where they don't really talk about the processor numbers and the clock speeds and the number of cores because they don't really have to and because they very, very tightly control and integrate the software, the hardware and the processor, it means everything works beautifully and seamlessly together and I sound like an Apple fanboy, I sound like I'm doing an Apple ad, but it really is that fast and if you watch any review about these new M1 chips, absolutely every review or even the tech reviews would like the Zillions of your viewers more experience than I do. Everyone is saying it's how ridiculously blazing fast these new chips are and how seamlessly they seem to work with absolutely everything. Let's take a quick look at the geek bench score, so there's now normally I'm not a huge fan of talking about numbers, but I think in this context, the numbers actually show you just how far we've come with this new M1 chip design and so if we look at single core performance, we see that the Macbook Pro, this Macbook Pro, this 13-inch Macbook Pro is absolutely leading the path with a score of 1,689. That is ridiculous because outside of these M1 chips, the next best is the iMac 27-inch retina that has 10 cores that's with the Intel i9 processor that's going to cost at least a few thousand pounds and we've got this thing for like 1299 pounds on 1299 dollars which is absolutely bonkers as they say and if we just take a quick glance through these numbers we see like these machines are sort of hovering around the 11-1200 mark and these are all of the old Intel base processors even the super super super super expensive super fast ones and this new M1 chip which is now on the entry level MacBook Pro, the entry level MacBook Air and the entry level Mac mini is just completely blowing them out of the water. Let's have a look at multi-core performance as well. Now multi-core performance is a bit it's a bit different because obviously like the huge as massively kind of 28 cores 24 core 16 cores 18 cores these massive machines that cost tens of thousands of pounds are going to outperform but actually here we have the Apple M1 which is about 7,400 7,200 we're talking the lowest 7,000 and if we look at what that's faster then that is faster than the 2019 16-inch MacBook Pro with the i9 2.4 gigahertz 8 core processor I don't really like talking about numbers I don't like talking about processor speed but this is actually just ridiculous and in my testing of this and I'm testing about the MacBook Air I don't have the Mac mini yet but I'm gonna swap it out and test that as well I just not noticed any issues in the slightest with performance and so I've sort of had to resort to looking at Geekbench scores and trying to understand how the stuff works just to see how this is even possible because the earlier generations the Intel designs of the entry level MacBook Air and the entry level Mac Pro's you could quite easily stress them out by doing things like having like 80 tabs on Chrome open and playing a video and I don't know using Final Cut with the old MacBook Air actually you just need three tabs open on Chrome and you'd be able to stress it out and hear the noise of the fan but now it's just ridiculously fast you don't see any performance issues and that's why I'm so excited to be using this as my daily driver moving forward and the reason I'm going for the MacBook Pro rather than the MacBook Air even though the MacBook Air is absolutely amazing is partly because the MacBook Pro has a fan and the MacBook Air does not and that means that if I want to do stuff like video editing I've got the option of a fan the MacBook Air will probably handle that completely fine as well but if you've got a fan then you've got the option of running the processor of high speeds and then the fan can cool it down whereas on the MacBook Air it would likely thermal throttle I don't even know if I'm going to be taxing it enough to hit those levels of performance but because for me this is only an extra ¬£300 and it's a business expense I might as well just go for the option of a fan and the extra I don't know 100 gram weight to which is not really something I'm going to notice. So I think let's talk about battery life and this is to me and to a lot of people even more important than processor speed because you know even these Intel processors they're pretty fast and this is an Intel-based processor so it's pretty fast I never really noticed any issues with performance but what I do notice issues with a battery life now for this 2018 15-H MacBook Pro I have to carry around my charger basically everywhere I go because if I'm using Chrome if I'm using Final Cut if I'm editing podcasts or movies or whatever I know the battery life like it's only going to last about four or five hours in terms of battery life whereas this the advertised battery life for this is 20 hours of video playback or like 18 hours of web browsing which is absolutely insane and if you look at the people who have had this for the past week and have done lots of extensive tests on battery life they're all saying the same thing the same that even on non-optimised apps of the MacBook Pro the battery life is still absolutely insane and over time as more and more apps get optimized for this chip the battery life is just going to improve and battery life is one of these things that actually makes a difference to how you work like honestly when it comes to speed I'm not really going to notice a speed difference between this MacBook and this MacBook or between any laptop that I buy because everything is fast these days but I will actually notice the difference in battery life it's a difference between just being able to take this in my bag and go to a coffee shop all day versus having to put this in my bag and having to put the charger and then having to go to coffee shop where I find it plugged and cable is like it's a huge quality of life improvement not to have to worry about battery life and that is probably the main thing that I'm so excited about with this new generation of MacBooks. Alright moving on let's talk about the keyboard and the keyboard is the exact same as it's been for the last few sort of iterations of the laptop thankfully it's the new keyboard mechanism that they introduced I think it was this year or maybe late last year rather than the old one which was really really crap and so this keyboard is absolutely fantastic and I'm going to do a little typing test alright typing test on this new MacBook Pro let's go 100 so 147 words per minute this is not too bad I just did a typing test on the MacBook Air and I got 159 and it's the same keyboard so usually I'm hovering around about the 145 to 155 but yeah this keyboard is absolutely amazing honestly it's probably the best keyboard I've ever used the this one and the keyboard and the keyboard that's on the new MacBook Air which sort of feels like the keyboard that's on the iPad Pro Magic keyboard but if I had to choose this one feels a little bit nicer overall other things on the keyboard is unfortunately we do still have the touchbar honestly I don't really use the touchbar for a lot of things occasionally I'll use it to select an emoji but often I find that the control command search option is just a little bit quicker with keyboard navigation thankfully we do have an escape key and we have this little touch ID button that also puts the laptop to sleep and then you can touch ID to wake it up which is quite nice trackpad wise things are pretty much the same as they've always been this is the best in class trackpad I try track pads every time I go to a computer shop to try them out and it's just fantastic like there are some Windows laptops that have really good trackpad these days but I guess for me I'm just so used to the way a MacBook trackpad feels that's the one this one the one of the MacBook Air even the one on this 2018 MacBook Pro it all kind of feels identical and we've got the forced touch we've got the haptic feedback we've got all of the things that we used to seeing and an absolutely world class trackpad so no changes there no complaints for me display wise this is another reason why I'm going to this laptop rather than the MacBook Air it's the same sort of display I think it's 2560x1600 right in the display this has 500 nits of brightness compared to the MacBook Air's 400 nits of brightness 500 nits is pretty bright and it's not like amazingly bright but it's reasonably good if you're outside and often I'm using my laptop on the balcony or in the garden outside even in broad sunlight I think 500 nits of brightness is a reasonable amount and I don't mind using it too much whereas 400 nits on the MacBook Air is a little bit a little bit hit and miss it's hard to reliably guess the screen brightness out of that 400 nits versus 500 nits so this is a reason why I think it's worth getting the MacBook Pro if you enter that sort of thing in terms of the ports slightly knowingly there are only two ports on this entry level model which I guess is to be expected because it is only an entry level model and I mean I use four ports on this one but because I want you to have a charger plugged in at all times I don't think I'll particularly be annoyed at the two ports situation usually if I do take this out on about I'm only using a maximum of two ports I'm not usually using more than two ports unless this is actually plugged into the whole shabang on my desk and of course we have a headphone jack for whatever that's worth I don't I can't remember the last time I actually used wide headphones but I guess it's nice if you're into that sort of thing as well let's talk about the microphone now and apparently this MacBook Pro has studio quality mics compared to the new MacBook era which has not studio quality mics so this is what audio sounds like on the MacBook Pro's microphones and this now is what audio sounds sounds like on my 500 dollar proper audio setup going back to the MacBook Pro this is what audio sounds like and at the same time we can test out the webcam the webcam I kind of wish it was a little bit better it's a 720p FaceTime HD webcam and with all the zoom calls and videos and stuff people are doing these days it would kind of be nice if they had a more 1080p a legit webcam this quality is slightly better than it's been in the past because now within the new M1 chip they've got the Spancie S Neural Engineer type thing which apparently improves the image quality on the fly computationally using some software related stuff but there's no getting around the fact that the webcam is still kind of crap and I wish they would have had at least a 1080p webcam or just like a slightly better camera on this given the amount of zoom calls and working from home that everyone's doing finally let's talk about configuration options if you are in the market for a budget laptop I actually think the base configuration of this is completely fine 8 course GPU, 256 gigabytes SSD storage that's one thing that I might think of upgrading and so for example if I was a student and I was very struck for cash I would firstly just go for the MacBook Air because I probably don't need the MacBook Pro but instead of paying 899 for the MacBook Air I could play it pay instead 1199 for the MacBook Pro with the student discount so it's an extra 300 pounds but in return for that you get the fan you get the touch problem which is totally pointless but you get the fan and you get slightly increased battery life and those are two things that I actually think it is probably worth spending the extra money on. I think the base model for most people is completely fine you might want to upgrade the storage if you're the sort of person who uses lots of storage and in fact for me the model that I'm going to use is going to be well the fully decked out version because it's going to be a business expense and if it's my daily ride with it I really don't care how much money I splash on this thing so I'm going to upgrade the RAM and go for a 2TB SSD because for me doing a lot of video related work stuff this has a 1TB SSD and it always runs out of space so it's going to be a really nice quality of life improvement to not have to worry about the hard drive space but this is overkill for most people you do not need to spend 2300 pounds or 2300 dollars on an entry level MacBook Pro and then deck it up if you're looking to spend that kind of money and you're not someone who reviews tech on YouTube and hopefully trust to make money from it if you're not that sort of person and you want this to be fully decked out I would probably wait until next year when hopefully the new 14 inch and 16 inch models of the MacBook Pro are going to come out with this new Apple Silicon Design chip I'd probably wait for those but for most people if you're interested in getting a MacBook Pro honestly I think the base model is probably completely fine for you and you might consider upgrading the RAM if you use loads and loads of very resource intensive things that rely on parallel processing and all that kind of stuff so that concludes this review of the 2020 MacBook Pro which is going to be my daily driver click here for my review of the 2020 MacBook Air which you might like to check out and then very soon over here there's going to be a video where I explicitly compare the new MacBook Pro with the new MacBook Air and give some unsolicited advice about which one in which one you should get. Thank you so much for watching and I'll see you in the next video. Bye bye.
