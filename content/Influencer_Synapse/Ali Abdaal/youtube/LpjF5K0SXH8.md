## Transcript
 Hey guys welcome back to the channel, it's Sunday morning and we are in the midst of preparing for our final exams. So we've got our finals in about three weeks time. It's going to be a multiple choice paper with all the medicines stuff and then there's going to be a short on paper where we have to write paragraph answers to clinical ethics and law scenarios. So we're chilling in Hot Numbers a coffee shop here in sort of simple town in Cambridge. Sipping on coffee and trying to read through these notes. Today is going to be a fairly packed day after this. We've got a hunter run through for the first half of the show. So that'll be good. And then to buy my mom and birthday presents. It's a birthday today and then we're going to drive back home to surprise her for a little birthday celebration. Should be a fairly fun day and see you in a bit.
