## Transcript
 Good morning. Welcome back to the channel. We're kicking the day off with a beautiful breakfast courtesy of our Airbnb host And then we're going to grab a tuck tuck. We've got a driver with us for the whole day who's going to be showing us around the city So hopefully we'll be able to show you what goes on in northern Cambodia. See you shortly So here we are in a traditional Cambodian house Which has been transformed into a museum of sorts the house is on Stilt as our most houses in this region because apparently during the rainy season get flooding and getting scorpions and snakes and things coming climbing up They also told us about the family that lived here So this is the ground part and grandma who got the house built initially and then it passed on to their daughter in son-in-law Unfortunately the daughter in son-in-law were around in the time of the Camer Rouge Which was 1979 and as the whole family was sort of full of intellectuals about a hundred of them were murdered by the Camer Rouge regime For those of you who don't know they killed everyone who was intellectual in an attempt to take the country back to a year zero a country where Everyone was a farmer and subsistence and that kind of thing off the hundred family members that used to kind of hang out by this house Only about ten remained and after the regime was overthrown one lady came back to Reclaim the house she's now 77 years old and she's the one who had the house converted into a museum because every time she sees it It reminds her of a family that used to be here the kids that used to play on on the furniture and stuff So after that quite hard hitting trip to the house museum thing here. We are at the bamboo train When we heard about it, we thought it would be just like a standard train, but we're pretty much gonna sit on these wooden slabs and travel the length of the train truck So we reached the end of the bamboo train And then is trying to buy a tank top And now for the journey back and we'll see you on the other side Hello again, so here we are on some random bridge and apparently the views are quite good. Look at that And here we have another bridge It looks pretty much exactly the same as the previous one. It's just a bit more wobbly We stopped for food at the foot of this mountain with a temple on it And I think we're gonna climb to get to the temple after lunch Oh that was a fantastic lunch Shelled there for like over an hour Now it's time for the climb People are laughing at us for being honest, I think Here's a temple I just There's just too many stairs really Cannot wait to barely float straight into the pool when we get back But we've got a while left All right, so that's the temple sorted now we're gonna ride to another temple Where we will see the sunset and see some paths which should be very very exciting See you there Now we're at the foot of yet another mountain with yet another temple on the top of it This temple was where the political prisoners of the Khmer Rouge from the Baton Bung city center We're taken and stored and tortured and then once they were done with they'd be sent down to the caves Where they'd be shot or bludgeoned to death and would be left to fall into the cave behind So about 10,000 bodies were piled up and They still got the skulls and bones from some of them on display So here we are at the top of the temple with some pretty great news and monkeys everywhere This is pretty next level, not gonna lie Fail over everyone, hello We're just chilling outside the black caves Because like over there somewhere And apparently when the sun sets the bats fall like fly out in their droves So hopefully we'll get to see that and then You'll also get to see the sunset at the same time isn't that fun? That is a great place Sometimes you win it, sometimes you lose it, sometimes it calls And so ends our wonderful day exploring Baton Bung with our amazing guide, Nani You've had a great time, thank you so much for watching the video Really hope you liked it, if you did give it a thumbs up If you haven't subscribed yet please do so And I'll see you in the next one, bye Down
