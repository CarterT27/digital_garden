 157 words per minute, there we go world record. Hey friends welcome back to the channel. In this video we are going to be comparing six of the most popular mechanical and membrane keyboards to try and help figure out what is the absolute best keyboard for maximizing our typing speed. At the moment my personal record is 156 words per minute and so for each of these keyboards I'm going to do three typing tests to try and beat that record and then I'm going to be rating them in terms of cost in terms of aesthetics and in terms of the typing experience overall and I'm going to share with you some of my top tips for how you can type insanely fast as well along the way. So grab a cup of tea if that's what you're into and let's start with keyboard number one. Alright so our very first contender is the IQ Unix L80 wireless mechanical keyboard. They've actually sent me eight of these for review. Each of them has different mechanical keyboards switches. Now mechanical keyboards are a bit weird because they're more expensive than normal keyboards generally and it's because the individual keys have a different type of switch inside them which means the feel of typing on different types of mechanical keyboards depends on what switch they've got inside the this one that I'm testing now has the Gatorton red switch in it it doesn't really matter what that means I'm going to do a more in-depth switch testing review at some point and in terms of aesthetics it's kind of nice um it's quite chunky it's like it doesn't have the numpad it's like a very solid build like it's like a metal metal and plastic and it feels kind of good. Now let's hop into the typing test and see what it's actually like to type in the Unix L80. 139 or not very good accuracy 95% 133 accuracy 95 alright 140 accuracy 96 alright yeah the feeling of these is definitely like much it much harder to press the keys than it is on the membrane keyboards which is probably why like it takes more force and it means I'm typing slower on this mechanical keyboard and so this one gives me an average typing speed of 137 words per minute this is my lowest typing speed I think it's not particularly high but it is actually very very satisfying typing on this particular keyboard and so when I'm doing something like writing my book this is the keyboard that I tend to default to uh put an affiliate link in the video description if you want to check it out that thing that has a bit of a discount on it if you want to get one of these there are a little bit expensive but yeah this is a pretty solid keyboard nice to type on but not the most productive keyboard out there and that brings us to tip number one of how to type in Sandy fast which is I call it the minimal movement principle now this is something that musicians use a lot like people who are really plot a pro piano or or they're trying to is that when they're playing their scales and things they try and move their fingers as little as possible like an amateur guitarist will be doing stuff like this and amateur pianist will be like hitting the keys with this whole like hands but the pros will be typing or moving as little as possible and it's sort of the same thing with keyboards this is partly why it is slower typing on a mechanical keyboard at least for me because my fingers end up moving quite a lot to be able to hit the keys and that is satisfying but it leads to slowness so when you're typing try and move your fingers as little as possible to hit the keys and that's why membrane keyboards generally tend to be faster at least for me all right next we have the key crown k2 wireless mechanical keyboard now the key crown keyboards are kind of similar to the ikey unix ones i'm not too much a fan of their design it's a little bit too black and red for my liking if you're mkbhd you'll probably like this if you like this aesthetic then it's great but the really good thing about the key crown series is that there are a lot cheaper than the ikey unix and other similar mechanical keyboards the k2 for example is about $69 whereas the ikey unix l80 is about $250 this is like 25% of the price it is a bit more of a plastic key plastic key build quality but really if you're looking to get a very good budget mechanical keyboard the key crown series is absolutely fantastic let's not go on to the typing speed test 144 words per minute um 96% accuracy not bad making quite few mistakes it's very good 143 95% accuracy 136 91% oh not very good at all the typing does feel very satisfying even though i'm slower and i make more mistakes i think if i were writing something like a long piece of work i actually would want to use this keyboard to type on because even if i'm typing slower it does kind of feel quite nice so solid aesthetics i don't have to press overly hard compared to the ikey unix l80 but design wise it's just not as nice just don't really like the colors so i don't know we'll see sort of matter of trade-offs isn't it so in my three tests with the k crown i average 141 words per minute a little bit faster than the ikey unix l80 and so that is the one that i'm going to be using for most of my typing but if you're in the market for something budget the key crown is absolutely fantastic and now tip number two for typing insanely fast is you want to learn the keyboard shortcuts for deleting entire words so for example on a Mac if you use command and backspace that delete a whole line if you use alt and backspace that delete a single word i think on windows it's like control and backspace or control shift backspace but basically anytime you find yourself hitting the backspace key multiple times there is a quicker way of doing it and i made a video about this a few months ago and loads of people have messaged me saying oh my god that single keyboard shortcut tip has like you know improved my typing speed by like 20% so yeah come on backspace or backspace or control if you're on windows all right let's do a normal kind of the keyboard now now this is the logic tech mx keys which is widely considered the most productive keyboard on the market we'll find out in a moment if that's true and this is nice because it pairs with the logic tech mx master three which is genuinely one of the best mice on the market again wireless bluetooth keyboard and in each of these keys it's got a little resting place for your finger so the keys are a little bit like whatever that means like riveted divoted something like that design wise honestly i'm not a massive fan of it like i don't really like the black space gray design aesthetic i know some people are super into this sort of stuff but i much prefer it when i have keyboards that are white and colourful because that's just the kind of vibe i like but production value build quality it's all very very solid indeed and i know a lot of people that really swear by this keyboard so let's see what the typing test actually shows 139 96% accuracy 137 139 96% accuracy 143 broadly faster typing speed than on the macalloc keyboards i think and it's it's more similar to the apple keyboards than it is to the macalloc keyboards but the the feeling of the keys on this like i really don't like this i know a lot of people swear by the mx keys and i really like the mx master mouse which is paired with this but i just don't really like the typing experience this would rank and basically have the bottom of my list of like pleasurable typing experiences because it doesn't quite have the feel of a mechanical keyboard but the keys are still heavier or they feel heavier to press then the apple magic keyboard does and so that plus the weird kind of design that i'm not a fan of means this keyboard does sadly not get my recommendation your mileage may well vary and on this keyboard i have an average typing speed of 140 words per minute it's the hassle right it kind of it's a bit weird right because it's it's not as nice in terms of typing experience as a mechanical keyboard even though it feels just as hard to press the keys so overall not really a huge fan of the mx keys but hey if it floats your boat you'll probably enjoy it next we have another one of my favorite keyboards of all time this is the iQ Unix f96 this is a keyboard that they sent me like two years ago that i've been using for ages which is why it's absolutely filthy this one has the cherry blue switches which have a a very specific kind of looking feel but i do really like the aesthetic of this one very good build quality all metal it's like very very hefty very beefy the issue is this is a very expensive keyboard i think it's $250 or $300 but i think it's worth it well i don't know i'll put a video up there where i've got my full review of it i really like it but then i'm also this sort of person that would spend 300 quid on a keyboard and not really worry about it too much but if you want it there will be a link in the video description which is an affiliate link that has a bit of a discount applied so you might want to get this if you like but to be honest the main thing i like about it is the color scheme like i just love the blue and coral and white it just goes really nicely with my aesthetic overall i think even sort of matches my hoodie but now let's move on to the typing test to see how productive this keyboard actually is okay 144 not bad oh 136 terrible so bad 95% accuracy oh it's starting to get repetitive strain injury right 141 once per minute so i've been using this keyboard a very long time these are the cherry blue switches so they sound they're like this sound quite clicky typing speed no when you're as fast as it is on on some of the other memory keyboards but it is quite a nice feeling i'm not sure how i feel about the cherry blue switches though i don't think they are my favorites i'll be trying out someone mechanic with these switches to see which ones i prefer and so overall average typing speed of 140 words per minute it's not bad mostly i like this keyboard for the aesthetic and the feel of the typing on it rather than because it makes me super super super fast at typing because i like a bit of writing my life i've been using this one for the last two years but now i've changed my kind of daily driver to the ike unix LAT does not much to choose between them they both feel pretty good to write on in a way i sort of prefer the design of this one but it's it's got the numpad and it don't really like that the ike unix LAT is a little bit chunky but it they both have a broadly similar writing typing experience overall and that brings us to tip number three for typing in sandy fast which is don't use your mouse so normally we think of our mouse as being a kind of navigation device we kind of use our mouse to go around a computer with our arrow but if you really want to maximize your productivity on a computer basically the ideas we want to be throwing away our mouse and instead using our keyboard for navigation as well that means learning keyboard shortcuts and using apps like Alfred and the windows logo key to open up windows and files and apps and for me anytime i'm using a computer and i find myself using the mouse i always think okay is there a quicker way of using the keyboard for this and to be honest i don't spend much more time on a computer on a keyboard than a lot of other people do but i think my typing speed is generally quite fast because i minimize my use of the mouse and maximize my use of the keyboard next we have our penultimate keyboard and this is the Razer Pro type this is Razer's Razer is usually a gaming brand but this is their productivity series of keyboards which is a mechanical keyboard that has Razer's special switches in it design-wise it is quite nice i love the fact that it's white i love the fact that the LED lights on it don't go different colors and they're just white so it looks really cool and very very high build quality i think this was around $150 to $200 so let's move on to the typing test and see what this one is really like right 141 i christian 95 oh 133 140 i quite like this keyboard in terms of the aesthetics but i don't really like the keyboard in terms of typing experience i think Razer using the run mechanical switches here and it's just not as nice as the ikeunix ones or it's just not as nice as the keycron it's just like it sort of feels very much like an old very old school IBM keyboard that we used to use in like school back in the day and like if you care about that throwback then it's fine but otherwise yeah the keys are quite heavy to press i'm not really a huge fan of this typing experience although i really do like the Razer white mouse and now tip number four for typing in saying the fast is to just practice the website that i've been using for all the typing tests all day today and that i've been using since the age of about 13 it's 10 fast fingers they have a good typing test it uses normal english words so you can just type the most common words in the english language and initially i started out when i was i think 13 and i discovered it i was around about 80 words per minute and over time i've come close to doubling that typing speed but yeah the more practice you do the faster your typing is going to get over all in the long run and finally we come to the final keyboard in our productivity challenge which is the apple magic keyboard design wise it's an apple keyboard it's very light it's very nice it's like that's why a bluetooth it charges via lightning bit annoying that it charges by lightning but then so does my iphone so that's fine and it's just a very very very solid keyboard all around so let's go to the typing test first and then i'll share my thoughts about this oh 155 words per minute not bad 157 words per minute there we go well right chord 153 words per minute not bad all right very very solid to be honest which ever keyboards i end up trying it's always this little apple magic keyboard that i end up end up going back to maybe it's because i'm more familiar with it because i've been using it for such a long time but it's it's quiet i can type on zoom calls i can take notes without worrying about the sound it's like really lightweight i can carry around if ever need to go anywhere and it's a keyboard where i get a ridiculously fast typing speed without making too many mistakes so there's just something really really beautifully nice about the apple magic keyboard honestly i think it's it's really hard to find a keyboard that is actually better than this one so my average typing speed on this was 155 words per minute and i actually beat my personal record with 157 words per minute so that's now my new record typing speed and in fact this was the very first one that i tested today so i repeated the test again like three hours later after testing all of the other keyboards just to see what difference would it make to my typing speed and yeah after three hours of testing my average typing speed did fall because my fingers were really fatigued but this got still around about 144 words per minute and overall what i realized is that if i care about typing fast which i do there is really nothing i've ever found that beats the apple magic keyboard it's just so simple it's originally prized so great i wish i had an affiliate deal with apple but i just don't because this is just such a fantastic keyboard that like my setup moving forward and in fact my setup for the last few months has been to have both the ike unix LAT and the apple magic keyboard on my desk at all times now when i need to do writing for my book where i want a nicer kind of typing experience i like the feet of the mechanical keys i use the ike unix LAT link in the video description but if i want to do most other things on the computer if it's night time or early in the morning and i don't want to wake up my housemate if i'm on a zoom call then i want to take notes that's experience of typing the apple magic keyboard is so nice and so chill and so relaxing in a way that i really don't like using the mechanical keyboard because of the clacketiness so maybe it's a little bit excessive having two keyboards on my desk at all times but i don't know i think it's like genuinely quite nice and i'm the sort of person who who appreciates the different use cases for the apple magic keyboard and the ike unix LAT and that brings us to the final tip for typing in the same way fast which is you should watch my video over there if you haven't already it's called how to type really fast at 156 words per minute where i give you eight more tips that i found really helpful for being a productivity grease monkey when it comes to my typing speeds so thank you so much for watching do drop a like on the video if you haven't already and i'll see you in the next video bye bye
