## Transcript
 Hey friends, welcome back to the channel. If you're new here, my name is Ali Yama, Dr. Based in the UK and this is the commemorative 1 million subscribers Q&A video, huge, huge, huge thank you to everyone who has subscribed to this channel and has supported the channel and me over the last three and a bit years. It's been an awesome journey so far and we're just getting started. So in this video, I'm going to be answering a lot of questions that people sent and via Instagram. Those will be linked in timestamps in the video description so do feel free to skip around if you feel like it because this is probably going to be quite long and quite randomly. The extended edition of this video is going to be uploaded to nebula more details in the video description and I'll tell you a little bit about that at the end but now let's just dive into it. Okay so the first question is what were your expectations of the YouTube channel when you first started it? This is a hard one to say when I started it it was in June 2017 and I originally started it as a way of kind of content marketing for my business you know helping kids get into medical school and so I always had in the back of my mind that one day this could potentially be big and I kind of knew how big some YouTubers were but I never at all thought that I'd get to that position of being kind of big on YouTube and I think the way that I was thinking about it was that I was trying not to think about the numbers at all like I didn't really have any kind of gold that I want to hit a thousand or ten thousand or hundred thousand I think the numbers that were relevant were that at the time when I started I had a friend who was on 4,000 subscribers and that seemed just about manageable. I thought that okay if I plugged really hard at this I can probably get to 4,000. I had another friend who was on 20,000 and that seemed completely unattainable and had another friend who was on 60,000 I was like there's no way in a million years I'm ever going to get to 60,000 subscribers so that was kind of the bullpock of numbers in my mind when I first got started and so even now I try not to have any expectations because I think if you if you set numerical goals that's just a recipe for disappointment because kind of the number of views number of subscribers number like amount of revenue none of that stuff as it is within my control the only thing in my control is churning out one or two or three videos a week and so that's the thing that I focus on I focus on the process rather than thinking about the scale or the outcome okay question two do you feel satisfied with what you've done with your channel yeah I feel satisfied with most things this is another one of those where if I felt unsatisfied it would probably be because of a focus on outcomes or if I felt satisfied it would also be a focus outcome so like I actually try not to think about whether this channel is successful or whether it's satisfying or anything like that just because that makes me think too much about the outcome even now I'm still focused on just you know video video just the process of churning up videos every week and making more courses I don't really stop and think at all about is this successful am I satisfied anything like that all right next question what would you do differently if you had the chance to start from scratch I think I probably focus on my website a lot more because I think there's a lot of scope for creating blog posts out of videos because once you've done the research for the video and made the video anyway it's only a small step to convert into a blog post I probably also would have taken the small step of converting each video into a tweet storm just like a series of Twitter threads which would have made it more shareable as well possibly even depending on how dedicated I was feeling even converting them to like an Instagram carousel of the main points I probably would have done that but again the fact that I'm not really doing it now means that I probably can't really be bothered to do that kind of stuff that's pretty much the main thing otherwise I think it's gone it's gone pretty well I sort of wish I'd thought to outsource editing a little bit sooner because it was a complete game changer when I did but that would be the only thing I'd say all right what is your favorite video on your YouTube channel I think my favorite video is one that no one else cared about which is it's got like Harry Potter medical science explained and that's where I look through some of the scenes in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone and explain some of the medical science in that that's probably the favorite of my favorite video that I've done even though it got basically no one cared relative to all the other videos okay what's the most underappreciated aspect of running your YouTube channel I think often what people don't see is the thought and like the system behind it I've kind of given a glimpse of that and some of my videos about notion where I kind of go behind the scenes of the creative process again that's a video that again comparatively few people cared about relative to a video about like how to type faster for example and so I think a lot of people just don't care which is absolutely fine but kind of the the the the systemization aspect of it and how in a way it's become almost a factory for churning out videos that's an aspect that I think is underappreciated I appreciate it as a strong word because I don't expect people to appreciate that but certainly when I show other YouTubers or like friends that behind the scenes they're always surprised at how much of a workflow and a system that is to producing videos okay if you had to choose one YouTube or Skillshare so I think at the moment I make more from Skillshare than I do from YouTube but I only make money on Skillshare because I have an audience that's pre-built on YouTube so if I could only pick one I would definitely pick YouTube because building an audience on YouTube is relatively straightforward and then you can funnel that audience into more paid things I wouldn't want to just be on Skillshare because then I'll have a class and it would have no one watching it because no one already kind of knows me so that's the benefit of YouTube and platform like Twitter and Instagram you build up an audience of people who hopefully know like and trust you and then you can monetize that audience further down the line if you want to why do you always mention how you do stuff when taking a poop this is a good question I suppose the reason I do it is because it gives me a bit of a kick to skirt the social norm of talking about defecation like I get a bit of a kick out of it I have no qualms about talking about my poo or wee habits and I think it's kind of funny and so when I talk about like doing a poo while doing something I feel like it shows that I'm taking myself less seriously and I feel like it's like ha ha ha look at that guy it's it's just like a part of my personality that I am happy to make come across on camera because in a way the weirdo you are and and and the more unapologetically you're weird to self you are on camera I feel like this creates a more kind of authentic experience for the viewer and I can real life I talk about my poo and we have it all the time so I just I try and be as authentic on camera as I am in real life because that's that's kind of the reason behind that pet peeves you know something that really grinds my gears is when when people talk in a way that makes other people feel left out like for example if we're if I'm with the group of friends and some of some of us in that group are in a WhatsApp group together and other people in the group are not and it really grinds my gears when someone references the WhatsApp group in that setting like oh my god do you see what thing you posted on that group last night like no don't do that that's just making people feel excluded and bad and that's terrible that is one of my biggest pet peeves in life what's been your favorite moment on YouTube there's probably two two favorite moments one is kind of it genuinely is fun to hang out with people in real life especially because usually the sorts of people that hang out with are the sorts of people that I would get on with anyway meeting up with fans through YouTube has been awesome and kind of by extension meeting up with other YouTubers that's been probably the most satisfying part about being a YouTuber because you automatically have so much in common with these other nerdy people who decide to make videos on the internet and I've definitely formed a few friendships that way so that's been pretty cool it's also really nice when a video performs well like you on the YouTube studio app it that you know it confetti comes about when you have a video that's doing particularly well and that's generally a very nice feeling it's a burst of indoor fin release have they been any videos that you've regretted posting no I don't think so if I'd regretted posting a video would have taken it down there is one video that I regretted posting although regretters a strong word there was a video I made about how I take notes on my iPad at work and I made a few flip and comments about like data security which I didn't see was an issue because in my head obviously it was fine because of you know iPad being offline and all this sort of stuff but someone actually complained to my hospital saying that I was being lawsay about data security in that video and so I had to take the video down and then kind of replace it with a more reasonable sort of less heavy-handed approach to data security that was a good lesson to learn fairly early on and so I don't regret posting the video but I regret to the distress that it calls someone if that makes sense all right who do you love more man to your fellow or Thomas Frank I don't like to choose favorites I love them both Thomas Frank has more directly changed my life because in like October last year he introduced me to standard which is the agency that I'm now part of and that's completely changed the game for me at the event I've been a constant source of inspiration ever since I started following his YouTube channel so they're both very much inspired me in different ways okay what was key to your growth between 600k and 1 million which seems so quick I think really it's partly coronavirus happened and so that kind of did well for a lot of YouTubers because a lot of people are more kind of staying at home I think also we had that one viral video about how I type really fast which is kind of really accelerated the channel growth in the past kind of 10 days or so and say there's probably the main things but the thing with the with the algorithm is that in in a way it is kind of exponential growth and if you can just keep on churning out the content and occasionally produce a viral video then I don't know it's it's hard to say how kind of the algorithm gods favour certain channels and not others but I suspect it's the coronavirus plus the occasional viral hit that we had in that time I have you ever thought about what you want to do after YouTube a new business what would it be I don't really think very far ahead and I also don't really like to think but I think like after YouTube isn't really a concept in my mind because YouTube is just kind of a platform to put myself out there and I want to be putting myself out there basically for the rest of my life and YouTube seems a very reasonable way of doing that at least in a short to medium term so as long as YouTube is the thing and as long as people still still care I think I'll continue to put up content on YouTube so and so I don't really imagine a after YouTube phase of my life which is probably kind of sad all right we've got when did you fully get into productivity stuff and who inspired you I think I've been vaguely into the whole productivity thing since I read the four hour work week which you know by Tim Ferriss obviously which is kind of a productivity book it's about how to 10x your output while working a lot less and so that kind of first got me into it and then I read a lot of blog posts to discover it ever note discovered this kind of website like life hacker which are productivity blogs that was around the time I was 17 or 18 years old and so that was kind of what got me into it and in terms of productivity content on YouTube I kind of stumbled into that accidentally you know I made videos about how to study for exams made video about my desk set up but the word productivity only really came into it when other people started asking me how I was so productive and then I realised that productivity tube is like a thing and start out kind of leaning more in that direction all right next we have do you miss being a doctor uh honestly no but I've only not been a doctor for about a month and a month feels like kind of taking a holiday and you don't really miss work when you've taken a holiday for a month but there's so much going on in terms of kind of the YouTube channel and the different stuff that we doing with the team and stuff going on at home with my mom and my brother and there's like always cool things happening and so I've not had a single day where I've missed being a doctor but I'm only a month into unemployment so maybe that'll change right what is the most valuable thing you've learned in your life so far how to answer a question like that what people are getting up with that kind of question is wanting some like life-changing piece of life advice there's never a life-changing piece of life advice it's often repeated learnings built up over a long period of time I suppose for me one of the big ones is just that people care a lot less about us than we think they do I think there's that quote that's often attributed to Eleanor Roosevelt which is that you'd stop caring so much what others think of you when you realise how seldom they do and I've seen this in so many different occasions where you know it's the the thing called a spotlight effect where we all act as if we're going around life with a spotlight trained on us where other people are going to notice at every mistake and at every faux pine or we set that thing and you know someone's going to remember that for ages but actually everyone is worried about their own life and they actually couldn't care less what's going on us and so when I first began to realise that and embody that that was what helped making make me more confident made me more willing to step out of my comfort zone made me more willing to put myself out there because I realised at the end of the day no one actually cares so that's probably the biggest piece of advice that I've come across all right who is your greatest inspiration of all time family doesn't count probably 10 ferris it's probably a bit cliche to say at this point but I think his work has probably had the single biggest impact on me through his book before our work week and then the podcast and so probably Tim Ferriss on the YouTube front probably Peter McKinnon you know when I started the YouTube channel I kind of thought in my head I would love to be the Peter McKinnon of medical school or the Peter McKinnon of medicine so his vibe has really inspired me early on so probably makes sure Tim Ferriss and Peter McKinnon what have you always wanted to do but were afraid to try honestly I've always wanted to be able to go up to a pretty girl on the street and just like talk to them and I've always been afraid to do that so that's an ongoing work in progress all right next question how long till you become a gym shark athlete I don't know man I think it's one of those things that's probably not going to happen but working towards it is kind of fun and kind of interesting and it encourages me to eat healthy and work out a bit more and get a bit more tension and stuff I feel overall I'm not very wedded to the outcome you know as with everything I'm not wedded to the outcome of becoming a gym shark athlete I care a lot more about the journey of trying to become a gym shark athlete and that's what's important for me rather than actually achieving it or not all right where do you see yourself in the next five years again this is another hard one to answer because I don't really plan that for an advance you know given that the future is so uncertain like you know two years ago I had would have had no idea how big this YouTube channel was going to get or that it would be a significant part of my life or that I'd be taking a break from medicine to be breaking full-time youtuber and so I really have no idea what my life is going to look like five years from now all I can do at this point is just keep on enjoying enjoying the journey because journey before destination it's the climb as Mali Saras would say so keep enjoying the journey and also just kind of keep my options generally open so you know in five years time of an interesting opportunity comes along I'd be reasonably well placed to take with that opportunity all right if you were to learn a new language what would it be probably Japanese I've been kind of dabbling with learning Japanese for the last like several years and it seems kind of cool uh and so I'd want to learn Japanese properly I think next on my list is Spanish after that who is your favorite music artist at the moment of why I've recently gone into John Mayer quite a lot uh I hadn't really heard any of this stuff before but in the last few months I've discovered John Mayer and you're great and he's an amazing guitarist, amazing songwriter very good singing and also I really like the fact that his voice is quite low kind of like mine and so for most of his songs they're actually not not really out of my range and so I feel like it's an attainable level of singing to get to could to kind of sing similar to John to John Mayer all right so those are the questions related to YouTube productivity and general uh life we also have a more extended version of this video where I just answer a load of random questions for Instagram without really any filter are you
