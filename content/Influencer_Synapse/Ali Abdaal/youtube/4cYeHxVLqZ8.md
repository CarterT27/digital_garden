## Transcript
 Hey guys, welcome back to the channel. Today is ambulance day. It's our second day of the emergency medicine placement. We spent yesterday in A&E and today I've been timetable to go out with the ambulance crew. We've been in the ambulance since like 8 a.m. and it's going to be a 12-hour shift. So far, we've seen two patients with broken mental hospital. It's been really cool zooming down the roads at like 70-80 miles per hour with the blue lights on and watching the cars like make way. 6 hours later. We're approaching the end of the shift now. It's about 6 p.m. We've seen loads of patients. It's been quite interesting. We saw some minor trauma. The person ended up with a few fractures of the spine and a pelvic fracture. We saw someone with an overdose. We saw someone with a stroke and now we've just got one more job left before before it's all over. So, what's in here? This seems to be in loads of drugs. Random pots are able to pee and I think disinfectants bags. Let's have a look. Exciting dressings, infusions. I am using an anti-nerv agent as well. That's very exciting. We have more splints, sea spine things. If someone has a trauma in falls off of a building or something, then you're worried about the cervical spine so you want to immobilise the neck. That's what we use those things for. Now our shift has just come to an end. We are just transporting the final patient into A&E. It was a patient who had pneumonia. So the GP requested that they'd be transferred. So yeah, all in all it's been a really fun day with the ambulance guys. The two paramedics I was with Ryan and Dave were amazing. Dave is like an X-Fource man who became a paramedic like 50 years ago. He was awesome and Ryan is finally a paramedic student. He seems to know everything and was just really, really competent. There was a patient who had taken an overdose and I would have had no idea what to do in that situation, but Ryan really was really good at talking to her and comforting her while also doing all the things needed to do like doing the blood pressure doing the ECG and all of that. So that was really quite inspiring to see. And they were recommending that at some point we should try and go up with the air ambulance as well. Apparently that's a pretty great experience. But yeah, all in all, great day. Now our working we're going to end the shift. Change out as a fancy ambulance out of it and then possibly watch strange things season two. See you in a good. Even if we're hanging by a threat by a threat and the words you said are spinning in my head in my head I just want to go you closer and I spend in this bed to take me back into your arms and I'll never let you down let you down. Three, two, one go. Russian female tennis player took a cup of stuff. Yeah, sheriff. Yeah, that one. Um a name from pink plane. Jet. Yeah. Seeks hours later. Because we're super cool we've decided to come back into the hospital at 10 pm in Upper Jammers to go to the doctor's mess to watch an episode of Stranger Things. After the ambulance shift we had an amazing dinner cut to see a flora. We've started doing this thing whereby one of us cooks each day of the week for the rest of the people. So that's quite cute and quite nice and she made an amazing roasted obrugine and veg curry which was awesome. Now we're strolling through the hospital in Upper Jammers and hang out in the doctor's mess. We've got ice cream with us. The doctor's mess in the hospital is absolutely fantastic. It's so so beautiful and it's much nicer hanging out in there than it is hanging out in our rooms and it's only like two minutes walk from our room so we might as well hang out in there when we can. All right time to enjoy this episode of Stranger Things. Thank you very much for watching. If you like the video please give it a thumbs up. If you haven't subscribed to the channel please consider doing so more vlogs coming soon and more videos about like a medicine application process if you're into that sort of thing. Have a lovely night. I will see you next time. Bye bye. See you. Bye.
