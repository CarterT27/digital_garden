## Transcript
 Hey friends, welcome back to the channel. If you're new here, my name is Ali, I'm a doctor based in the UK and this is a review of the brand new Apple 2020 M1 MacBook Air and because, as you guys know, I'm a huge fan of upfront conclusions, I'm just going to tell you upfront. I think this laptop is basically as close to perfect as an entry-level laptop can be. The early 2020 version of the MacBook Air was nearly there. It was nearly the perfect laptop and even then I said that if anyone is in the market for a laptop and you can afford a MacBook and you want a MacBook, you should just go for the MacBook Air. That one had issues with thermal performance and fan noise and overheating and stuff. This one has none of those issues. This laptop is absolutely sick and in the rest of the review I'm going to try and justify why I think this laptop is absolutely sick and why it's pretty much a no-brainer if you're in the market for a reasonably priced MacBook look no further than this. This is the one. So if you've got a thousand dollars that you want to spend on a laptop or nine hundred if you're a student because you can get this one student discount then you might as well just buy it. I'll put a link in the video description for whatever that's worth and you can just buy it and you can turn this video off and do something better with your time. But if you're interested in the full review that's what I'm going to be talking about. Now let's start by talking about the processor and this is the big news. Now in the past Apple has been using Intel-based processes but now as of like this week they have switched some of their laptops the MacBook Air, the MacBook Pro and the Mac Mini reviews on those coming shortly. They switched all of those to the own internally designed Apple Silicon M1 chip. Now this means that the processor is similar to what you get in iPhones and iPads iE it's really really really fast and it's very like ridiculously well optimized for Apple hardware because now Apple makes a software that make the hardware and they make the processor as well and that means that you just get ridiculous levels of performance and you get this always on thing so as soon as you open the device it just turns on kind of like you would expect with an iPhone. Let's talk about numbers now so when it comes to the Apple design processes like on the iPhone, the iPad and the Apple watch. They don't really talk about processor speed and clock speed and all of that stuff that you hear the Android phone manufacturers talking about because Apple just kind of aid they don't care and be they like to show they don't care and see it really doesn't matter what the numbers are because everything is so tightly integrated. In the past with the Intel-based chips they were talking about processors they were saying hey this is an Intel Core i9 3.2 gigahertz over clock to blah blah blah. A core processor like whatever. Now they're just calling it the M1 processor because no one really cares about the numbers but if you do care about the numbers and I have now started caring about the numbers because I'm trying to be a better tech reviewer. You can look to benchmarks like the Geekbench score and that gives you an idea of how like the numbers of how well the processor is performing so let's take a look at those. Now here is what the Geekbench scores look like so if we look at single core performance you see the MacBook Pro the Mac Mini and the MacBook Air the M1 versions are absolutely miles ahead of everything else even the mid 2020 you know the one that just came out Intel Core i9 3.6 gigahertz 10 core processor on the iMac is like 25% slower than these new M1 chips that are on this nine hundred dollar MacBook Air if you're a student. This level of performance is absolutely insane. If you're a normal person using the laptop even if you're even if you're a pro kind of using the laptop you are very very very unlikely to have any issues with performance just because of how fast these processors are. Secondly let's have a look at multi core performance and now you know we've got the super fancy Mac Pro's which cost like $50,000 Intel Zion blah blah blah but if we look down this is the Mac Mini with the M1 and these are the M1 processors so they're in the 7,200 to 7,400 range and all of these are the ones I like very very expensive but this tiny cheap laptop here is faster in multi core performance than the 16 inch MacBook Pro which came with the Intel i9 processors with with 8 cores that only came out last year that's a huge beast of a laptop this is a MacBook Pro 15 inch MacBook Pro from 2018 this has been my driver that's driving this whole setup with like four Thunderbolt ports and all all of the stuff going on since 2018 and I haven't needed to upgrade this because it was fast enough I did not need to upgrade to the 2018 or the 2019 or the 2020 versions and this is so much faster than this in terms of just the raw gear and scores and so when it comes to buying a laptop this is ridiculously cheap now like for the amount of performance you get you're not going to have a problem with processor speed. Secondly let's talk about thermal performance now this MacBook Air famously does not have a fan and with the previous MacBook Air the the one in early 2020 which I called my favorite laptop at the time that had enormous issues with hope with overheating if you did a few different things it would get really hot and it would start to make a huge noise because that had a fan and if you were like sitting on a sofa with it in your lap which I do a lot then my jeans were getting really really hot and I would I would always think like I've wet myself because this thing was just getting so hot on my jeans this I've had like literally literally zero issues with it it does not have a fan it doesn't even need a fan because this processor is so efficient and so I you know the sort of stuff that I use computer for is chrome notion Spotify Slack very occasionally I'll use Final Cut because I don't really edit my videos anymore but like it's fairly basic computing needs even though I'm massive nerd I don't really use any apps that stretch it that much but even with like 20 tabs and chrome open and Slack and Spotify and zoom call this was not even it was not even coming close to getting hot it was that efficient. The only context in which this might be a problem is if you are using very very intensive apps in which case you might want to go for the MacBook Pro instead because that has a fan and so theoretically it will have less thermal throttling at those higher levels of performance but for most people including me you don't really need those high levels of performance and so the MacBook Air is absolutely perfect. Final thing about the processor is the idea of app compatibility now because Apple have designed these processors the way that programmers apparently design their software is that it is optimized for specific architectures a processor. So all of the apps previously that were running on MacBooks were optimized for Intel X86-based processors who knows what that means but that's what they were optimized for. Now some of the apps and all of the Apple designed ones are very well optimized for the new M1 chip so all everything that Apple makes like Safari and Final Cut and the photos app and messages and most of the stuff you would need to use is perfectly optimized for this but if you're the sort of person who uses lots of third party software a lot of products in the Adobe Suite for example are not yet perfectly optimized they're going to become optimized very soon and apparently a version of Photoshop that's fully optimized is coming out early next year but in the meantime you are running slightly suboptimal performance versions of those. I don't really use any of those personally I haven't tested them myself but based on what other reviewers are saying even the unoptimized versions of Premiere Pro and Photoshop still work completely fine and so the only circumstance in which you you should worry about app compatibility is if you for your personal workflow you're using like a really really niche app which might not yet be updated and so before you go buy one of these or one of the new M1 chips what I'd recommend is that you do a Google or you search on YouTube and you see whether your app has been updated and it's compatible with this chip for 99% of people watching this video you are not going to have any issues at all. Moving on from processor let's talk about the other thing that are important about this so firstly the design it's great it's very light I'll put the weight over here once I've had a chance to stick this on my scales in fact you know what I'm going to do that right now. Oh 1,262 grams and I'm not going to say that in pounds and ounces because I'm not a heathen 1,262 grams 1.2 kilograms. This is this is very light. In fact this is my 12.9 inch iPad Pro with magic keyboard. Oh 1366 this friggin MacBook Air for 900 dollars if you're student is lighter and cheaper than this setup which costs us overall like 13400 or 1400 pounds and is actually heavier like that is that's pretty cool so 1200 grams let's get this out of the way. Design-wise it's got two ports we'll talk more about that later and it's the same kind of wedge design that you have grown to love they haven't really updated the design at all everything is basically the same from the previous versions of the MacBook Air which is fine because this is this is actually great the only slide before I have with it is that I wish the bezels around the screen were a little bit less thick you can kind of notice them and in some modern windows laptops they don't have any bezels at all but hopefully they'll update that for the next time let's not do my favorite part which is the test of the keyboard and I'm going to do a typing test on 10 fast fingers let's see what my typing speed on this keyboard is isn't this fun oh they've changed their design hello all right let's do oh the jet I have beaten my record on this previously my record was 156 words per minute this is 159 words per minute I want to get this on camera look at that 159 words per minute on this new 2020 and one MacBook Air the keyboard in fairness is the same as it was last time but clearly my typing speed is slightly improved this is a good keyboard this is sick pitching I can updates my how I type really fast for you to say 159 words per minute now that's very exciting but yeah overall this keyboard is great I really like the fact that it has an escape key and this is like one annoying thing about the MacBook Pro line that has that crappy touchbar over here there is a touch ID button which can lock the computer as well and they've got the function keys at the top that you increase brightness do funky stuff I don't really use the function keys for a lot it is nice to have them for like play fast forward rewind on Spotify and the escape keys really helpful but yeah this is an absolutely fantastic keyboard no complaints favorite keyboard more time yeah just a new Apple keyboard model so after that flex of typing speed let's now talk about battery life which is probably more important than the keyboard because battery life is another area in which this machine has made absolute gains over the previous models now Apple are advertising that you can get like 15 to 17 hours of video playback slash web browsing on this new MacBook Air and another two hours on top of that on the MacBook Pro which has a slightly bigger battery and this is absolutely insane this is like at least a 50% increase over previous generations and I've done a lot of browsing the web for these battery tests and basically everyone is saying that's guys when you look at the battery behind this thing like the battery size itself has not changed compared to the previous models but because this new Apple design M1 chip is very very very efficient at using the battery it just does really well in terms of battery life now if this was the only thing that was improved with this generation of the MacBook Air or the MacBook Pro I would have upgraded because I think an extra 50% to 100 percent battery life is worth it because now on this MacBook I have to carry around a charger and because of the battery life improvements in this thing it means that I actually don't need to carry a charger around and this is a significant quality of life improvement for me and my shoulders and my back so basically zero complaints on the battery life front but actually the battery is one of the reasons why I'm probably going to go for the MacBook Pro rather than this MacBook Air because for an extra $300 I'm getting an extra two hours of battery life which is useful day to day but if you're the sort of person who buys one of these and has them for a very very long time like my housemate has been using her MacBook Air for five years my old housemate has been using a laptop for eight years if you're using a laptop for a very extended amount of time over time the battery gets less and less good and so if you're buying a laptop to have for the long run then you might want to buy the MacBook Pro instead which has for $300 a slightly better battery and therefore you're going to have slightly better battery life overall throughout the life of the machine next let's talk about the track pad which as usual is best in class I have used so many track pads over the year and every time I go to a computer shop I try our track pads and this is nothing just nothing that is as nice as one of these track pads these haven't really changed a lot apart from adding four start and likes have to take feedback they haven't really changed a lot since like 2012 2011 which is good because it's a perfect track pad I can't imagine a track pad being better than these ones I really sound like an Apple fanboy in this review but these laptops are amazing and they've just made them even more amazing with the M1 chip and it cost exactly the same which is just next level moving on to the display it is exactly the same as it's been recently it's a high definition high resolution right in the display 2560 by 1600 pixels and it has 400 nits of brightness what does that mean? well 400 nits of brightness you know it's at its maximum point it's reasonable but not super bright the mag pick pro has 500 nits of brightness so it's 25% brighter 400 nits is pretty good for most people in most circumstances but for example if you're on the beach or you're trying to work outside in the garden and there is a lot of sunlight you might struggle to see something on a 400 nits brightness screen if that's something that you really care about you might want to go for the mag but pro instead this is something I do actually care about which is why I'm probably going to go for the mag pick pro rather than the mag pick air but it is one of this let's talk about ports now so we have two USB 3 slash 4 slash thunderbolt ports over here and you have a headphone jack on the other side this is a little bit annoying it would be nice if they have more than two ports because you know one two three four I'm using all four ports on my 2018 15 inch mag pick pro to connect to my big display on the EGPU and all the other kind of stuff it would be nice if they had more ports now for most people two ports is absolutely fine especially given the improved battery life you probably aren't going to need to lug around a charger with you if you're taking this out for the day and therefore you probably won't need to have a charger permanently plugged under all times like I have to do with old laptops and of course because there USB C slash thunderbolt you're going to need a dongle if you still have old USB A devices most of my stuff these days is now USB C anyway so this is absolutely fine two ports is reasonable but if you need more you probably don't want to go for one of these let's talk about the microphone and the camera all in one now this has pretty standard microphone features on it and so I'm going to film a video using photo booth and you'll see that this is what the microphone on the MacBook sounds like and this is what my proper five or a dollar audio setup thing sounds like and now going back to the MacBook Pro this is what it's like and if I look at the camera it's still this really annoyingly bad 720p FaceTime allegedly HD camera but what they've got this time is now they've used the neural engine fancy bits of the processor which means that the processor is doing image improvements on the fly so I look a little bit better and this is similar to what the iPhone and the iPad do with their cameras that even like there is a lot of computational software stuff happening behind the scenes to make you look good and now this is what is on this camera as well so if you're on FaceTime calls with your friends and family or zoom calls with your friends and family and colleagues then you'll have a very slightly nicer camera but it's not because of the camera it's because of the neural engineering thingy underlying it that improves the image quality. The final thing to talk about is what configuration of this you should get so let's have a look. So I'm going to talk about price and pounds which is basically identical to the price and dollars now the base model costs 999 pounds or 999 dollars and you get a 100 pound discount if you're a student. I actually think the base model is completely fine for most people you could just buy this and you don't need to get any upgrades because a 256 gigabyte SSD is reasonable for most students and for a lot of people and 8 gigabyte RAM is again reasonable for the vast majority of people. If you're a pro and you need to run lots of applications that use multi-core stuff and that needs to store a lot of stuff in its RAM and maybe you want to upgrade to the 16 gig version but if you're a pro you probably don't want to get this one unless you're like me and you just want to upgrade if you're a pro you probably want to wait until early next year for the proper 640 and 16 inch Mac but pro has to come out because if you're a pro then those are going to have even better performance than this so you probably want to wait for that and so if you're a student and strap for cash then the basic model the cheapest model of the MacBook Air will be completely fine for you. If I was getting one personally for me I care a lot about performance and I don't really care about spending money and so I had to go for the upgrade and I'd actually probably go for the two terabyte SSD as well. It's because I do a lot of work with videos and so for me even like one terabyte SSD isn't enough this one has a one terabyte SSD which used to be a lot more expensive back in the day and I often find myself running out of space so if you do a lot of work with like really huge asks for cave video files like the files of this video are going to be like 150 gigabytes in total. If you're that sort of person then you might want to upgrade the SSD but again if you're that sort of person you probably don't want one of these as your daily driver because you're probably doing more pro work flowy type things but long story short the configuration I would recommend is just the cheapest one. There is a case to be made for upgrading the ram usually um this is controversial should you stay with a gigabyte ram or should you go 16 gigabyte ram? A lot of people say that you actually don't need to upgrade the ram some people say that you should. I think if you're a student and you strap for cash you probably want to notice the difference between a gigabyte and 16 gigabytes but if you can shell out the extra cash then hey why not upgrade to 16 gigabytes especially if you're going to keep keeping this laptop for a very long time and so the question is should you buy the 2020 and 1 MacBook Air and my answer is if you want to spend a thousand dollars on laptop or thereabouts then you really can't get anything better than this but as I'm going to be talking about in my next video if you can if you intend to keep this for a very long time and you want to shell out an extra $3,400 then I would consider upgrading to the MacBook Pro instead and that is what we're going to be talking about in this video over here in the next few days if it's not that already so thank you so much for watching I really hope that was useful do hit the subscribe button if you want already and I'll see you next time bye bye
