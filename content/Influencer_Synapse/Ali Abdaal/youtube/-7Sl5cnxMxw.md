## Transcript
 Not sure if it's a month or an A's inhibitor That's really good. Okay, hey kid. What I analyze them all today, so you might get a publication out of it Calzone, pyroglits is on Hey friends welcome back to the channel if you knew here. My name is Ali. I'm a doctor working in Cambridge and because it seems like you can't be a medical YouTuber without doing some kind of medical meme review I thought we'd do a medical meme review in this video, but it's gonna be a little bit different in that I'm gonna be reacting specifically to To memes generated from the Cambridge University Medical School. So these are all fairly niche But I don't know. I've never seen these before. I just downloaded them all off the Facebook group So we'll see how they go and hopefully they won't offend too many people. So number one All right, organizing elective. Oh, okay. So this is a reference to the fact that medical electives Which is you know this holiday that you go on in your fifth year of medical school You're supposed to be doing like you know medical stuff in a different country for two months But a lot of people treat it as a like a sort of going to the beach. I think that's what this is getting at Rose's or red bones they can fracture Collagenese clistridium histidic acid That's really good Collagenese clistridium histidicum. So clistridium histidicum is a type of end. It's a type of bacteria No enzyme collagenese is an enzyme that it produces and Jupiterence contracturaries like this weird thing that happens to your hand in certain conditions like liver disease That's quite funny student doctor. I'm going to prescribe a course of BAK8-644 So this is a reference to the fact that in our second year of of medical school We learn about all these weird esoteric drugs like BAK8-644 Which are only used experimentally and not actually used in real life. So, you know That's that's funny. Yo dog. I hear you like feedback. So I asked for feedback on the session on giving feedback That's kind of funny because Cambridge as a medical school is obsessed with getting feedback from the students This is a good thing Objectively, but the students like to make fun of the fact that we get asked for feedback so often In prex skills and someone noticed it notices your GC veins Yeah, that's a standard med school thing So apparently I have quite GC veins and so if you see someone with GC veins then you think oh I want to put a cannula or take your blood and you know to get a bit of practice So we learn by practicing on each other. So that's a reference to that Clinical skills I've signed off Okay, so every medical school like needs to has this kind of every medical student like everywhere has the has these kind of logbooks that you supposed to sign off When you've done certain clinical skills like putting in a catheter or putting in a cannula and The joke here is that Everyone kind of waits until the last minute to get these signed off and the The university emails are so all says that hey you should have your clinical skills signed off by the end of the year And no one's got a sign off by the end of the year, so they have to extend it that line Kind of big joke, but you know, obviously by the end. It's a requirement from the general medical council that we have these skills signed off So we get around to doing them eventually grad students taught a pack. Oh, okay, so grad students are you know people who have done Degrees and then applied to medical school which is not normal in the UK In normally the UK you go straight into medical school from second from a high school Whereas in the US and in other places you do your undergrad degree first and then you do med school So it's this is making fun of grad students. I guess so bachelor of arts. Yeah, that means I've got a degree Zimmer frame, which means they're really old Wedding ring which means they're married and time-turner All right, I think as a reference to even either the they're trying to travel back in time or they just get a lot of stuff done Not sure what but that's quite funny One does not simply find something unmedid So that's a reference to medid, which is the sort of virtual learning environment online sort of on effectively online Google drive of the medical school is based on muddle Which I think a lot of universities use and Famously it was hard to find stuff on medid because Clearly the students didn't know how to use computer properly April not sure if it's a month or an ace inhibitor That's really good. Okay So ace inhibitors are a class of drug like cap to prill in now a prill Lesson a prill and they all end in PR I L so this is funny April not sure if it's a month or an ace inhibitor Nus so you've been in a coma since 1978 medical student how will I pass motor all my knowledge is completely out of date That's where you're wrong kiddo So motor stands for mechanism of drug action and that is the the pharmacology lectures that we get in our second year And this is again a reference to the fact that we get taught about all these drugs that are You know historical and old fashioned and stuff When the consultant asks you where the false form ligament is It's in the tummy somewhere This guy is it is this monkman from there from like two years ago in university challenge Yeah, I mean the false form ligament. I think is part of the liver, but that would be as far as I can go Can't be time-tabling error if you if don't tell other the timetable Okay, I think this is pretty standard in all universities in the world that you know Sometimes the admin can get a little bit complicated so it's hard to find timetables for things When exam term hits you like profound personality change. Oh, that's a good reference. So this is a reference to I think it's a patient call was it was it? Finius Gage I think that was his name. He was a guy who was in a railroad accident We're like a railroad rod went through his brain But he completely survived. He just it just went through his frontal lobe so he had profound personality change And this is one of the classic cases in a in psychology. I think that was that was his name don't quote me on it When your supervisor asks you for causes of chest pain and you want to show off Nutcrackerosophagus Tuck a super cardiomyopathy Bricordial cap syndrome. I'd sell near-endocrine cousin Elm of the lug and Bricadas syndrome These are all quite rare quite niche things where it's obviously causes of chest pain or you know Heart attack or pulmonary embolism of you know stuff like that hey kid, what I analyze some audit data you might get a publication out of it All right, there's absolutely classic so it's like a common thing among amongst medical students that you're trying to get publications You know, you're you're trying to get your name on an academic paper and it's common knowledge that the easiest way to do that is to do an audit Or to analyze some data from an audit where you just collect loads of data about stuff going on in the hospital and then you write it up And the joke here is the medical students just running away as soon as you know Probably the doctor said that has said this to them when she asks you what you do if the hip exam was normal Oh In our fifth year we have these in as part of the exams you have to do a newborn baby check on like a doll and you have to sort of examine the hips to see There's any dislocation of the hip and one of the questions that I think I got asked in the exam was what would you do if the hip examination was normal And that's a bit baffling because you expect the question what would you do if it was abnormal and you've got like a list of things You do if it was abnormal, but if it's normal then you're like well I don't know It's it's normal who cares Yeah deciphering CPC abbreviations CPC stands for clinical pathological conferences and they are up there the pathology lectures that we had at Cambridge And obviously like in all of medicine there are so many kind of abbreviations and acronyms and stuff that when you're just starting out in your fourth year or your first year of clinicals It's actually really hard to to figure out what things stand for so you have to end up Googling everything I'm not going to access for right ventricular heave Baguette okay, so that's Jeremy Corbyn touching up someone Accidentally I think I think this went around some time like last year or two years ago Jeremy Corbyn is the leader of the Labour Party in the UK And he famously had this moment on TV where he was kind of holding his hand up like this again some random woman I don't know who she is, but this is actually how you assess for Right ventricular heave so the right ventricular is a part of the heart and in certain hot conditions Kind of if you if you do that you can feel like the movement against your hand and that would be called heaving It's a sign of certain kind of certain hot conditions, so that's really fine Descipling exam abbreviations. I think I have no idea what they're talking about. Oh This is saying that so that's Theresa May and she looks to be a Bacteria or a pathogen or something trying to attack a cell and the cell is protected by the NHS the National Health Service of the UK And this is Jeremy Corbyn fighting off this bacteria So this is a very left wing pro Labour government way of Kind of looking at politics in the UK calzone pyroglis is own Pyroglis is on his a diabetes drug Will we find intelligent life could it be right here or not? Could it could it be this man? Let's rank applicants by desksiles, but make it university blind. Oh Okay, this is this is really salty. So In the UK when when you finish your final year of med school and you're getting jobs jobs within the National Health Service are up and down the country Where you end up is sort of based around how many points you get in this score out of a hundred and Part of the contributing factor to your score out of a hundred is where you ranked in your medical school So if you were in the top ten percent you would get ten points So top twenty percent you get nine points top thirty percent you'd get eight points and if you're in the bottom ten percent You don't get one point So it means that you know the higher you rank in your medical school the more points you get in this thing But people at you know supposedly elite prestigious universities like Oxford and Cambridge love to complain about the fact that These rankings are university blind. So the joke It's quite a list. I'm not I'm not a huge fan of this the thing they're complaining about is that oh, well, you know If you came first desksile if you came top ten percent in a low ranked university You would be getting more points than someone who came top twenty percent at Cambridge and the idea is that supposedly coming You know ranking higher at Cambridge and Oxford would be harder than ranking higher at a kind of less prestigious university So this is a very kind of salty me based around that my heart the beauty means stress. I could run Okay Zero point five mils of one in the thousand adrenaline, okay So no buto mean is a type of drug that stresses the heart and an echocardogram is a sort of ultrasound of the heart That you can look and see what the heart looks like Zero point five mils of one in a thousand adrenaline is Is sort of what you get if someone if someone is having an aphylaxis Or you know a severe other allergic reaction you would inject adrenaline into them to try and dampen down the response to that Results are open campuses guys So that's when the exam results come out online and when your heart goes like I can feel you relate to that that's not a hundred percent true when the beat drops second degree hot block Mobits time when the beat drops So that's funny because this is a type of heart rhythm Mobits type one slash wonky back pot of second degree hot block where you get heart beat heartbeat Heart beat and then you drop a beat so you miss a beat and it's called a drop beat So when the beat drops that's kind of funny if 52 year old man has had a laceration sutra closed Three ampules of lighter cancer upon one percent we used with one in two billion adrenaline 16 sutras were placed with five minutes. How many bananas can you eat for lunch? Yeah, classic Sometimes the the perception of exam questions is that this is what they like Hahaha Right, so a few years ago the university decided to do this thing about trying to teach Resilience to medical students about because you know a big part of being a doctor is about being Resilient in the face of adversity, but we just kept on getting these emails like every single week about You know a reminder to take part in this resilience questionnaire And so this is a reference to how the university was obsessed with you know trying to get us to fill out this resilience questionnaire Arthroscapy for knee O a change my mind. This is Arthroscapy for knee osteo arthritis So Arthroscapy is a sort of procedure that orthopedic surgeons do where they kind of put a whole into the knee and kind of look through it with a camera But famously There've been loads of studies what a few studies that have shown that the actual operation is just as good as Shams surgery so shams surgery is when you put a cut in the skin and you like And he's to tell you the patient and stuff and you do everything as if you're going to do the operation But you don't do the operation and it's one way of trying to figure out the placebo effect of surgeries But it's easy enough to find a placebo effect if you're just taking a pill You know you just give someone a sugar pill instead that doesn't do anything But it's a lot harder when someone's actually having surgery because the fact they've got a wound to fact They're recovering all of these factors play a part in the placebo effect So What this is referencing is that this some evidence that says that actually Arthroscapy is Identical to placebo so the operation doesn't actually do anything and so this guy's saying change my mind. This is legit Quite clever me free sandwiches ethical objections to farmer reps. Oh, that's another interesting one So drug company reps like sales sales people often come into hospitals and enter into universities and Provide free sandwiches for lectures of talks in return for being able to Plug their drug for five minutes during the thing kind of like sponsored YouTube videos Where the YouTube will plug Skillshare.com or audible.com for what's actually a thought or check out my link in with about notion or bringing to or for what's actually early your curiosity stream.com or whatever They plug that in return for money usually or free stuff But in medicine Like the we allow these sales people to plug their drugs and saying oh my this like river oxaban is a better Anti anti-coigula then it picks a band because of this is this and in return to give us free sandwiches So there are some people that have an ethical objection to this they say that drug companies should not be allowed to buy their way in to Stuff by offering free sandwiches This is actually not as bad as it used to be in the past in the past used to get drug companies and a flying doctors first class to holidays and stuff and then Selling them the drug how long has this been going on patient a while some time Oh man This is an absolute classic so One of the questions that obviously we need to ask is doctors when someone says Dr. I've got back pain you ask how long has it been going on for and the patient says oh a while I think like okay And then you try and get them to clarify a bit further. You're like oh, you know, what do you mean by a while and they would say like oh, you know just like some time But like the right way of approaching that is okay Are we talking minutes or hours or days or weeks and like oh, no, no. Oh, no, doctor It's been going on for five years and then you kind of get the information you need So this is a reference to this unimpressed looking kid when someone says a while Anyway, we still got a fair few memes to cover but this video's got a very long and I don't know I don't know to what extent these are actually interesting for people who are not at the university I think a lot of them are general medical student things But a lot of them are sort of inside jokes and stuff, but you know, hey everyone's doing medical meme reviews So I thought I'd make this the first one if you like the video please give it a thumbs up Let me know in the comments what you thought of this I'll put some other random videos and a playlist of you here so you can check those out if you like thanks very much for watching and I'll see you in the next video. Bye you
