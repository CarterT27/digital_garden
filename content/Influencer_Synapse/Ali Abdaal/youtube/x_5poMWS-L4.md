## Transcript
 Hey friends, welcome back to the channel. In this video we're going to go over 10 cheap purchases that have improved my quality of life. Let's get into it. Coming in at number 10 on the list we have a physical alarm clock. Now this is really cool because before I had one of these I used to use my phone as an alarm clock and I'd have the phone on my bedside table but inevitably it would mean that I would spend hours and hours scrolling through Twitter, browsing Instagram and attempting to reply to messages on hinge at night when I should have been sleeping. But ever since I got one of these I now have the physical alarm clock on my bedside table which means I can have the phone across the room away from my bed or even in the kitchen on charge if I really need to get up one morning. And so for a relatively cheap investment of like between 5 and 20 quid depending on how fancy the alarm clock is you can massively improve your quality of sleep if you get one of these. Coming in at number 9 we have the trusty electric toothbrush. Now the only thing that you need to have in an electric toothbrush if you have one is it needs to have a 30 second timer. So the cool thing about this one is that you go and then every 30 seconds it does like a and it sort it tells you when 30 seconds are up and it tells you when two minutes are up. So you can spend 30 seconds on each quadrant of the mouth and then you know when you've been brushing for two minutes I've been using this for the past year now and I noticed a massive improvement in like the whiteness of my smile and my brother even commented on it when we were recording our podcast he was like oh your teeth look really white and I said it's because I've been using one of these time toothbrushes and he bought one immediately so you can get one of these 20 quid 30 quid just find the one that has the 30 second timer on it it's absolutely fantastic. Coming in at number 8 we have the trusty ukulele now I started learning the ukulele when I was in my second year of medical school and really it was the first instrument that I learned and I learned by following YouTube tutorials I just really liked the idea of playing the guitar but the ukulele seemed was it was a lot cheaper because I got it for like 15 quid off Amazon it was a lot cheaper and it seemed a lot easier to get started with the ukulele and within like 10 minutes you can learn to play the basic chords and then if you practice around 5 or 10 minutes a day for about a week or two you get to a point where you can like play songs on the ukulele and you can like sing along and it's really fun and the ukulele was really my gateway drug into the world of music super easy to learn would highly recommend I link to a cheap version on Amazon in the video description you can basically get the cheapest one learn how to play that and then if you want you can upgrade to a slightly fancy or one but yeah 15 pounds for my basic first ukulele it was pretty awesome and it got me into the world of music at number six on the list we have my absolute favorite writing pad of all time this is the puck up pad like I've tried billions and billions of like writing a 4 writing pads over the years and I always keep coming back to the puck up pad because it's like the quality of the paper and the quality of the vibes and the feel and the look and the general spiritual essence that it puts out is just like second to none I quite like the basic puck up pad originals I feel that many of these in medical now I'm using the puck up pad project version which has the same quality of paper but it's got these like dividers because now I've got more money I can afford like slightly better stationary and so this is how I've been kind of planning the book that I'm writing and it's just really nice having like an a4 pad sitting on my desk at all times and I've got pens right sort of within within it arms reach and so if I ever need to write anything down this there's just something nice about being able to scribble it on an a4 pocket pad rather than have to write it in an app so I highly recommend these these are fantastic the best pads I've ever used in my life At number six on the list we have a synergy of books by Austin Cleon all of these are fantastic they're really good they're very inspirational and I have them I have like physical copies all three on my desk at all times as part of my desk setup in particular as you guys know show your work was the book that most changed my life because it encouraged me to write online a video over there if you want to check that out steel like an artist is all about stealing ideas like an artist and it talks about the general idea that nothing is original we don't need to worry about having original ideas we can steal like artists and get ideas from different sources and there's a nice quote at the start on the nothing is original chapter that says the writer Jonathan Letham has said that when people call something original nine times out of ten they just don't know the references or the original sources involved so this is really cool and then his third book keep going is all about how to stay creative through the good times and the bad and so it's like a really nice like it's very cheap my buying all these books it takes like 20 minutes to read each of them and I've sort of these are very well-thumbed through so anytime I'm having a bit of a creative rut or I'm in a bit of a slump I just pick up one of them they always live on my desk and I just grab one I open it to a random page and I always find inspiration so thank you Austin for that links to all those books down in the video description making it number five we have the water bottle I have a water bottle on my desk now at all time just having it on my desk and having it be a slightly nice one that kind of goes with the white vibe of the rest of my desk it's just been amazing because now I drink so much more water and drinking water as they say is good for you and I've noticed that on days where I drink more water I feel less fat I feel less bloated and my skin feels like it's glowing not sure how much of that is placebo but yeah we were talking medical school that you should drink two liters of water day thanks for having a water bottle on my desk this is now what I do at number four we have the trusty deck of cards I basically had a deck of cards on my desk close to hand for the last almost 10 years of my life I got into doing close-up magic in 2011 after watching a chap called Michael Vincent on pen and tele full us and initially close to magic started off as a way of trying to increase my sexual market value amongst my peers at school but then when I go to university and reinvented myself as not a massive nerd I decided to continue with my close-up magic and I used to perform at balls and parties and events around the university and I used to get paid for it and that was pretty good because back in the day I wasn't making that much money as I did not do on this youtube channel so you know being paid to walk around parties dressed up in a tuxedo and going up to groups of people being like hey you want to see a magic trick that was that was my jam back in the day and even now like I always have a deck of cards on me because if I ever need something to do with my hands then I just do some flourishes with a deck of cards because otherwise the devil makes work for idle hands coming in at number three we have the Amazon Kindle you can get these quite cheap it's probably the most expensive item on the list but like the cheapest Amazon Kindle it's sometimes like 50 or 60 dollars you can get a super cheap honestly the Kindle is like one of the physical items that's like most impacted my life because just getting a Kindle let's you just gives you the ability to read infinitely more books then you would otherwise these days anytime I get a book recommendation I just buy on Kindle immediately and I can start reading it there and then it's just absolutely amazing I've been using a Kindle basically every day since 2008 or whenever the first Kindle came out and yeah it's just so good I cannot recommend it hard enough I have a video over there that talks more about why everyone should get an Amazon Kindle this one is the Kindle Oasis it's a little bit fancy you probably don't need the Oasis you could just go for the Kindle Paper White or to be honest you could just go for the box standard Kindle depending on how much money you want to save and I read this every night before bed it's what I do when I get into bed I take my mouth shut after doing my skincare routine and then I just read on the Kindle until I fall asleep so huge huge impact on my quality of life with a fairly cheap, fairly small device moving on to number two we have this this is a door stop I've probably got the most bang for my buck out of this purchase that anything else in my life because when I was at university I always used to have a door stop and it would always prop my door open these days probably not so relevant if you're you know in Covid times in the pandemic but once the world stops ending highly recommend a door stop for absolutely everyone because if you're at university or if you have an office or if you're at home whatever most day at university. Proping your door open is like the best thing ever because you want to cultivate this persona where your friends who walk or walking by feel let it's okay to interrupt you while you're working because like if I look back on my university experience I don't at all remember those nights where I was like oh I've got to work a little bit harder to get like an extra one percent on this essay but because I was a sort of person who people would feel comfortable interrupting in the middle of work like those interruptions and those like welcome distractions have turned into friendships that are still lasting today and so if you're the sort of person who props the door open with a door stop at university or wherever you are then it's just generally good vibes all around and finally at the top of this list one purchase that has immeasurably improved my quality of life is a subscription to Skillshare who are very kindly sponsoring this video.
