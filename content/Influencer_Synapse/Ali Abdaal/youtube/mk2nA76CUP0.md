## Transcript
 Hey guys, welcome back to the channel. If you're new here, my name is Ali. I'm a junior doctor working in Cambridge and this video I want to share my thoughts about the new iPhone 10S Max and I'm going to be talking about the stuff I like the stuff I don't like about it And overall I'm going to be trying to answer the question of whether I think it's worth it as usual times times for everything I'm going to talk about I linked in the video description so you can skip around if you feel like it and to save you a bit of time I'm going to start with the conclusion which is that overall this is a fantastic phone It's obviously the best iPhone ever made. It's incredible. It's a joy to behold. I love using it But is it worth the 1200 pounds that it costs to upgrade to it? I'm not so sure Especially for me. I upgraded from the iPhone 7 Plus. I don't think that particular jump iPhone 7 Plus to iPhone 10S Max is objectively worth the 1200 pounds Although I see objectively like we can never really judge these things on an objective level But towards the end of the video I'll be giving you my own personal framework for judging whether a piece of Technology a gadget is worth it based on what it allows me to do and whether it makes me any happier as a person and all that kind of stuff So what do I like about the 10S Max first that it's a really good size It's pretty much identical in size to this 7 Plus and I was used to the plus sized iPhones therefore this works Secondly, I kind of like the whole face ID thing It's kind of cool that you can just look at your phone and then just unlocks and I really like the fact that there's no home button And instead you swipe from the bottom that feels like a very natural wave interacting with the phone And I think this is this is like a good direction that they went into get rid of the physical home button in terms of specs Yeah, it's obviously the best iPhone ever. It's obviously the fastest iPhone ever It's got some kind of x-bionic some sort of chip in it There are loads of other youtubers who are far better than I am who have done in depth reviews of the specs and all the benchmarks and stuff I have no real interest in that personally because to be honest ever since like the iPhone 5 speed was never really an issue The screen is really nice as well. I suppose but again qualitatively if I hold it side by side with my iPhone 7 Plus I can sort of see a difference but then for a few days I went from this back to the 7 Plus and it like it pretty much felt exactly exactly the same So everyone talks about how the screen is amazing and yeah, I guess stuff on it looks nice But you don't really notice that unless you are kind of viewing things side by side and yeah The camera everyone's talking about the camera the camera is pretty solid the new portrait mode thing is nice The whole studio lighting contour lighting. I've got to be honest I've taken some photos with this and then took some photos with my 7 Plus and I really I couldn't notice much of a difference Like this one was obviously slightly nicer and like very slightly more like sharp and very slightly better looking And the portrait mode on this is better than the 7 Plus But other than that there's like again like unless you view the images side by side You won't really notice a difference. I don't think and especially if all you're doing is I'm loading to Instagram or Facebook Where you know iPhone 7 Plus quality is pretty much as good as iPhone 10S Max quality Okay, what about the stuff? I don't like I talked about how I kind of like face ID because it's kind of cool But occasionally face ID doesn't work and that is when it becomes a bit annoying Probably the most annoying thing about it is that when you have your phone on the table in front of you and you see like a notification is popped up You can't actually see the contents of the notification unless you unlock it with face ID and when you do it's kind of cool It's like it's it just says Instagram notification and then when you unlock it it shows you the message Which kind of makes sense to good for it's good for security But if your phone is sitting on the table in front of you like if you're at work like I often am with my phone in front of me and I get a notification I can't read it immediately. I have to like lean forward or like grab my phone Lift it up to my face and then unlock it and then I'm able to read it and that is a bit annoying like I Almost missed the days of touch ID where all I had to do was extend my finger press the button and I would be able to see the notification But then like other than this face ID thing There's not much to not like about this. It is an absolutely beautiful phone. It feels wonderful I've got the Apple Silicon case which just feels really nice and I like stroking it Yeah, I know overall really solid phone nice way feels like a genuinely premium product the screen is beautiful It's really nice to use but is it worth it and that is what I want to talk about now So how do we decide if something is worth it? Well, I guess I guess we all have a different ways of doing it, but the way that I like to shoehorn my own thinking on this is Sort of in three parts. Firstly, doesn't make me any happier does having this iPhone 10S Max make me any happier than my iPhone 7 Plus And the answer to that is clear. It's it's no it does not make me any happier in my life was a 10 out of 10 before I had this and it's still a 10 out of 10 There's no you know Increase in personal contentment levels of personal pleasure levels from having a 10S Max instead of a 7 Plus adding new stuff to our lives Almost never makes us happy But I think there are two cases where adding new stuff to our lives can make us happy and those are points two and three and this kind of framework General framework of is something worth it So point number two is does it remove any salient negatives from my life? And this is something I came across on a blog on a psychology blog and then I I read more about it and apparently there's quite a lot of research that shows that if you want to spend money to increase your happiness then The the increase in happiness comes from removing negatives as opposed to adding positives So there's that classic kind of money happiness curve that goes like this That when once you get beyond a certain point of personal income or household income then additional increases in money Or in salary or whatever Don't make you as happy as they once did and that's what it makes sense. It's like if you're living Kind of in poverty or below the poverty line or if you're struggling financially or if money is an issue Then having more money removes money as an issue and therefore makes you happier as a person because then you don't have that negative Kind of weighing on your shoulders, and I think it's kind of the same when it comes to Buying stuff in our everyday life. So for example, let's say I absolutely hated Earning my shirts every morning and it was the main of my life and I had to spend ten minutes Earning a shirt every morning if I were to pay the 15 pounds a week or whatever it costs to have Someone professionally wash an iron five shirts for the week that would be an investment that would make me happier because I've removed that negative from my life But let's say you know right now I decide I want to buy the new Mavic 2 Pro drone Like my current Mavic Pro doesn't suck enough and it's not a negative in my life Therefore adding this additional you know upgraded drone is not going to make me any happier as a person So that's kind of the framework where I'm approaching this and that's the question that I was I'm asking you about the Siphon is it removing any salient negatives from my life and the answer is sort of yes The sort of is that the iPhone 7 plus the my old phones battery was getting a bit annoying in that I always had to carry my charger around because the charge would last for about half the day and then I'd have to charge it And there were a few instances where I forgot my charger where the phone ran out of battery and that was you know Just like a bad experience and really annoying and I was like I don't want to happen again So in that sense Having an iPhone 10S Max with the increased battery size and the fact that it pretty much lost all day Means that that particular negative has gone from my life Whether you think that's worth 1200 pounds to you is an entirely different matter I personally don't think it is I could save that 1200 pounds and instead just buy an extra charger or make sure I've got my anchor charger a power bank thing with me at all times But then other than that, there weren't really any serious negatives that the iPhone 7 plus had compared to the 10S Max and therefore Overall it probably hasn't really contributed to an increase in happiness Because it's not really removed any salient negatives If you're upgrading from an iPhone 5C or something that's really really slow in that annoys you every time you open it Then yeah fair enough upgrade to the best iPhone It'll last absolutely ages because it's fast and it's amazing and it's incredible and the fact that your phone is now fast Rather than slow is likely to increase your personal levels of happiness Okay, so that was point number two in this weird framework thing a point number three is asking ourselves the question of Does this new thing allow me to do anything or allow me to make anything that make my life better or more interesting or more fun? So what do I mean by this? I mean for example, let's say you get your first camera like proper camera And now you can suddenly start taking really nice photos of your friends of your family of your kids of the surroundings of landscape And you get into photography or video editing as a hobby The camera hasn't taken any salient negatives from you, but the addition of the camera means that you now have this whole avenue of life that you're able to explore And therefore it increases your happiness and actually a camera is one of the best purchases I've ever made when I was in my fourth year of medical school Because it's just created so many memories and having a camera that takes beautiful photos Those photos like looking back on them now It's just an absolute joy and I wouldn't have had that if I'd just stuck to my iPhone camera Equally something like buying a guitar a guitar is not gonna make you any happier because it doesn't remove any negatives But it does allow you to then learn the guitar and learning the guitar is a fun skill and you get it's quite Social you get to meet people you get to sing songs It's just like a nice thing So that's why this is point number three in this framework of does this new gadget allow you to do things that would then Contribute your enjoyment you're happiness your satisfaction with life And with the iPhone again the answer is a sort of not really so the things that this is now allowed me to do is that a It's encouraged me to post on my Instagram a bit more Does that have any real-life benefit Sort of because the more I post on Instagram the more memories I personally build up The more memories I can share with my like grandma and my family back in Pakistan who care about my Instagram photos And in a way because I'm a youtuber and like to think of myself as like an influencer and stuff The more I the more active I am on Instagram the more the personal brand gets built up and therefore that leads to You know benefits further down the line so in a way it's nice having the iPhone tennis max because I know that right It's got a great camera. I don't need to bring my proper camera out everywhere or go I can just use this I can take photos. I can put it on the gram That is kind of helped but to be honest. I didn't need to spend 1200 pounds for that I could have just watched a Gary Vaynerchuk but here where he's like, you know just post more on Instagram And it would have had the same effect probably But yeah having this has it's kind of been in a good excuse To like I've been thinking to myself right I have a decent camera on my phone Therefore, I'm gonna start taking more photos for Instagram rather than just thinking that all every photo on Instagram has to be from the camera But again, that's pretty much the only thing that I can think of in this category of you know Expert things that this this new device helps me do and therefore overall if we consider this like 3.4 Well, it doesn't make me any happier Probably not secondly, does it remove any silly negatives and that sort of battery life is kind of nice? And thirdly does it allow me to do anything more creative or more interesting sort of it encourages me to personally Instagram Overall it's probably in my opinion probably not worth the 1200 pounds or the 1250 that I paid for the 256 gig version So then why did I buy it? For me personally it was two two reasons firstly I now consider myself a tech youtuber therefore I knew that if I bought the iPhone 10s max I could then make a video about it and I was planning a video and I'm still planning a video about what's on my iPhone And it's kind of nice if that's an iPhone 10s max rather than an iPhone 7 plus that's got scratches and stuff on it So that was one reason and secondly I I really wasn't planning to buy this phone, but then my mom's iPhone 5c broke down Screen crashed and she was complaining how slow it was So then that got me thinking huh if I get the iPhone 10s max I can just give my mom my iPhone 7 plus and my mom loves taking photos on a phone, but you know her eyesight is now a bit bad So she has to like you know she can never focus properly. So I think I thought having a big a big screen and a nice camera might be good for her So for those two reasons firstly because I could make a video or two or three about it and secondly because I could give my old phone to my mom That was why I bought this I wasn't under any delusions really that it would make me a happier person because you know You devices almost never make us happier as people and arguably that's only real thing that matters when buying a new piece of Gadgetree especially considering the opportunity cost This ¬£250 could have bought about I don't know lots of malaria nets for children and Africa and therefore could have potentially even saved life But I decided to spend it on an iPhone instead so yeah overall I love the iPhone 10s max It's wonderful it's the best phone ever of course the camera is amazing the phone's amazing it's beautiful To use it's a joy. It's it's wonderful all of that stuff I think I don't like about it the face I did a little bit annoying some of the time but overall it probably isn't worth at least for me It wasn't worth the ¬£250 that I paid to upgrade from the iPhone 7 Plus Of course for you depending on how you feel about you know this whole But it make me happy would it remove negatives and will it allow me to do fun stuff Your kind of mileage might vary so yeah that was my very long and rambly review of the iPhone 10s max Let me know what you thought in the comments. I've not really done like a proper review thing before on YouTube But if you like the format Can you please let me know or if you didn't if you could give any sort of advice about what I can do differently next time I want this tech thing to become more of a thing on the channel I really enjoy technology. I like talking about tech. I could do it all day But I'm not really sure what format these videos should take Because I kind of want to make them different to the so for example mkbjd and Jonathan Morrison and they've got absolutely incredible videos with that amazing Buttery B-roll and I don't just want to become another mkbjd copycat although that's not necessarily bad thing But yeah, I don't know let me know what you thought if you've reached this far Thank you very much for watching if you liked the video. Please give it a thumbs up if you haven't subscribed to the channel yet Please consider doing so have a lovely day and I'll see you in the next video. Goodbye
