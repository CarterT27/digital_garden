## Transcript
 Let's camera set it with absolutely insane, like 1, 2, 3, 4, other more. Hey friends, welcome back to the blog. It's gonna be a fun day, so we're heading down to London to Shoreditch, to Stephen Bartlett Studios to record an episode of his podcast, The Diary of a CEO. This feels really scary to be honest, because the sorts of guests that he has on are like ridiculously a high caliber and like high end. I am not. And so it's like, I really, I have this like, in big imposter syndrome type stuff that's been in my head for the last couple of days since we found out about this interview. I'm trying to do a lot of prep for it, re-listening to his audio book, which is really good, by the way. It's called Happy Sexy Millionaire, which is an interesting, clickbaity kind of title. But it's genuinely absolutely sick. We were listening to it in the car yesterday, and there was so many bits where me Angus and John were like, whoa, this is really good. Anyway, that interview is starting at 1pm, so we're about to take the train down from Cambridge to London, and apparently they're gonna send us a car. It should be interesting, but I'm also a little bit scared. All right, cool. So we're on the train, but the iPad busted out, and I am doing some prep for this interview. I e re-reading the book, going through like a chapter, figuring out, okay, what are the main points he's talking about? Because as I was listening to the book, I found that a lot of the stuff that Steve talks about, is very similar to the stuff that I've talked about. The YouTube channel, but he approaches it from a kind of entrepreneur CEO perspective, whereas I approach it from like a YouTube or creative type of perspective. Just trying to familiarize myself with his stuff as much as I can before going into this interview, because what I'd ideally like to get to be is not so much an interview about me, but I'd like it to be more of a conversation. Probably this is a big part of the imposter syndrome, I'm like, I feel that his insight on all of these things is going to be more valuable than mine, and so if we can turn it into more of a two-way dialogue, I'm hoping that will help me feel less as it, that I'm not providing a value, because that's the thing that I'm like, super, super concerned about with this sort of stuff. All right, so we're in the car. On route to our friend Steve's studio in short-itch, pretty nervous, pretty nervous about it, not going to lie. I'm trying to think about it, but also trying to convince myself that, actually it's just going to be a friendly chat, and I don't need to like overthink it, or worry about like performing, because I feel like with this sort of stuff, the more you're in your head about it, the less, well, you come across. All right, here we are. Let's camera set it with absolutely insane, like one, two, three, four, other more. It's mine, it is. Send it to my camera, fans here as lenses. We were thinking we were going to go super high and without podcasts and have like three angles, maybe one on a slider. And then just coming here, it's like, buddy help. All righty, let's just grab some shooting. Thank you very much for having me. We're talking a little bit about imposter syndrome in this. We kind of told you the podcast about, at least my feelings of imposter syndrome. How did you deal with it? Because you were like, you know, 28 years old, very successful, younger than Dragon and Braggins then, you must deal with imposter syndrome a fair bit. Yeah, I've always been curious about this idea of imposter syndrome, because I've never really, I thought I'd never felt it. And then I realized that as it's the case with like pre-stage nerves when you go on stage and speaking front of 9,000 people, we actually probably all feel something very similar. And then our perspective, what we tell ourselves that feeling is, which comes from our biases and insecurities and fears, changes the words. So for me, before I go on stage, I feel something in my chest. Yeah, I feel this, you know, this like, but a fly, like, feel the adrenaline coming through my body. And I tell myself that I'm ready and I'm excited and that is normal and that is okay. And a lot of people will feel that thing in their chest and they'll tell themselves that they are nervous and the nerves come from their lack of preparation and that they're going to fail at what if you, and they feel the same thing, but then they tell themselves a story about the feeling. The same applies for imposter syndrome. In my life, when I find myself in situations that are clearly outside of my death, I've never been on Dragon's Den before. I've never been a Dragon. I'm sat next to Peter Jones, who's been there for 17 years, Deborah, who's been there for 15 years, clearly I'm not, I have no experience here. However, I tell myself that that's how my life is supposed to be. I'm supposed to be outside of my death. I'm supposed to feel uncomfortable. It's supposed to be a challenge. I know deep inside of me that for pretty much everybody who is striving forwards, they will live their entire life. One, and they should live their entire life just that one step outside of their zone of comfort. So for me, I go, yeah, I'm in this massive room of investors, or I'm on this stage in Barcelona. There's 9,000 people waiting for that tunnel for me to come out. Or I'm sat on Dragon's Den and the first pitch is about to walk through the doors and all these cameras. And I go to, and that voice comes in. It tells me the story of how it gets, you're supposed to be here, Deborah. You're supposed to be uncomfortable. And you're going to be forever. And that is okay. And look at all the other times, you are uncomfortable. When you are pitching and eating your soul for this business idea you had, when you were, you know, you first signed your first investment deal, when you first spoke on TV, you've been uncomfortable and out of your death and somewhere you're not qualified to be forever. Yeah. You're supposed to be there. And that is the path to growth. Those are my growth moments. This comfort and feeling like, fuck, I don't know what I'm doing. And in fact, that's how everyone's ever grown. Every human that's ever walked the earth, that's made progress, has done it by that one marginal stuff, outside of their zone of comfort and... Yeah. Yeah. It's great about that. Thank you, I knew it. I know what you thought about that before, but yeah, so it's professional. Thank you for their appreciated. Right, just wrapped up the interview. I had to change my shirt into this t-shirt because I was sweating so much through it. Because of the nose and the lights and everything. But yeah, great conversation. And last year around two and a half hours, apparently it was one of the longest interviews they've ever done. Yeah, it was kind of nice because I sort of lost myself in the conversation. And it wasn't really thinking about the camera's and stuff while I was happening. Great shot. Love Stephen. Brave. Full of wisdom and insight and like a bunch of other cool things. And I really like that point that Steve said afterwards about imposter syndrome that actually... It's all the same kind of feeling. That feeling of like... stuff inside your stomach. And you can interpret it as nervousness or as excitement or as anticipation or as a poster syndrome. And I think the story I told myself about it beforehand was that I've been interpreting this as a nervousness and it poster syndrome. Where are I moving forward? I can start changing my interpretation of that to be more feeling of excitement and anticipation rather than a feeling of like, oh my god, this is going to be really hard. Right, so we are back in Cambridge. It's been a pretty solid day so far. I think it's about half past five. I'm still kind of buzzing from this from this chat with Steve. And it's just like so good. I can't wait to listen back to it. There's a big part of me that's like, oh maybe I... Maybe I'll reveal too much. Maybe I was too honest with him. But I think he did a really good job of like actively listening and asking questions. And I feel like... Yeah, kind of going in my aim was to have more of a conversation rather than being like an interview. And I think it was like a conversation rather than interview. So yeah, that's out on his channel. On his podcast, or we'll see you, check out the link in the video description and we'll be here somewhere and subscribe to the podcast. And thanks for watching and we'll see you next time. See you later.
