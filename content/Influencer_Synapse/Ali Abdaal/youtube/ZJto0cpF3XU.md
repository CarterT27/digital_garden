## Transcript
 You have a secret girlfriend. You have a secret girlfriend. You're dating someone. You are getting married soon You secretly have a girlfriend. He he you have a secret girlfriend and you have a secret. Wow a lot of people Think I have a secret girlfriend. Hey friends welcome back to the channel if you knew hit my name is Ali I'm a doctor based on the UK and in this video I'm gonna be answering a lot of assumptions that you guys sent in via Instagram very exciting We're gonna be talking about productivity my body my emotions my stress my friends me as a person Medicine and med school money YouTube my brother and the biggest category of all love and relationships And actually love and relationships category seem to have about 80% of the different things people wanted me to react to and so I'm gonna be showing these assumptions and then Explaining whether they're true or whether they're not this is gonna be fun This video is also gonna be completely not very valuable if you're watching it and you're looking to learn something Maybe to help you in life to be healthier happy or more productive Which is normally what we're about on this channel So if you're interested in anything actually useful Please go watch anything why Matt Diavella or Thomas Frank or Peter McKinnon or there's a long list of YouTubers that you can watch actually useful stuff from This is a very self-indulventive video where I just talk about assumptions because I'm running out of content ideas All right, let's start with the productivity theme assumptions and the first one is from a bully or two Who says there are days where you just don't want to do anything but be in bed for the entire day? Not really I don't think I've ever had a day like that. We're in just one line bed for the whole day Usually I want to be doing something or another and the most I'll usually line bed in the mornings doing absolutely Nothing and being a total wastement is about an hour So next we have Ankeesa Kapoor who says you secretly enjoy procrastinating. I don't know I don't think I secretly enjoy it. Just enjoy it I think we all enjoy it procrastinating. I like to think of my procrastination as being productive procrastination And actually little piece of life advice here something that I've found helpful this year is when I'm procrastinating Like if I'm just on the sofa and scrolling through my scrolling for Instagram or something You know, I'll catch myself and then I'll I'll ask myself What do I want to be doing right now? And if the answer is not scrolling for Instagram Then I will just get up and do the thing often. It's like if I'm procrastinating Then I'm just kind of going for Instagram completely pointlessly and I'll actually rather be In bed listening to an audiobook or reading a book or even having a bath or even just sitting on the computer or even playing PlayStation But I end up scrolling for Instagram So I do secretly enjoy procrastinating, but I also try and be mindful of what I'm doing when I'm procrastinating next From Emily with Recapable you disregard your emotions as acknowledging them would be unproductive I feel like I do acknowledge my emotions Especially if I'm having something like disappointment or anger or fear or doubt or anything Anything that even borders are being an negative emotion I acknowledge them and then I figure out why that emotion came about and then I decided Do I want to continue feeling that emotion or do I want to not feel that emotion and if I don't want to continue feeling it Then I will kind of rationalize it away and then usually I'll discuss that particular emotion with my brother on our weekly podcast called Not everything which you can check out on the link in the video description next They've got a few are around the idea of sleep So Sarah Nichols are the youtuber says you never sleep because sleep is for the week Homeras as you don't sleep at all Keras as you find it difficult to allow yourself to relax with causios says you don't take a day off I've only says you work in your free time You never really switch off to relax You never rest you don't take a break ever you need to be busy all the time every day of your life is productive You are a workaholic you never procrastinate you are so productive that you can work every hour of your waking life I don't know where this where where where this stuff comes from like I do lots of I Do lots of like day in the life videos where I show myself actively being a waste melt like spending an hour Just lying in bed doing absolutely nothing spending an hour just like playing playstation spending an hour sitting on the sofa I don't know what you guys are doing that you think that this is like you paragon of productivity I sleep very well. Thank you for asking I sleep like seven to nine hours a day normally on average about eight hours a day these days that I'm unemployed When I was working as a full-time doctor, I would sleep maybe about seven hours a day But I think there is some truth to like I do kind of find it hard to relax Because often my mind is racing with something related to work or the YouTube channel or I just want to read a book And so when it comes to just sitting down and watching a movie I don't find that particularly relaxing because I Always I kind of think in my mind that like I could actually be doing something better with my time That I would probably enjoy more like I was that you love listening to audiobooks I would happily sit on the sofa listening to an audiobook for hours at a time But for some reason if I'm watching a movie it feels a little bit more wasteman like now We've got a few different assumptions about my body in various forms of the first one is from Shadab R2 says you look like you skipped like day. Yes. I absolutely skipped like day I'm not a fan of like day, but I've recently started working with a personal trainer who forces me to do squats and deadlift with a kettlebell Every single time we work out and so hopefully I will start to look less like I skipped like day Lucy toughenel says you've got a six pack absolutely not I'm working on it, but one day I'm John Jay 01 says you're insecure about your teeth. I wouldn't say insecure about it But I want my teeth to look a bit straightaway, which is why I've got invisible lines now I'm not wearing them right now because they make me have a list when I speak and so I take them off on I'm filming you in film and YouTube videos for the most part Lucas says you mostly work out with jeans No, I was working out earlier today and I've got my gym shark leggings with my gym shark shorts And my gym shark hoodie on which is kind of my workout outfit of choice Policies you haven't hidden tattoo. No, I do not and Irums says you want to get hench so you can get women. Yes, that's how to fit you right I could I will be first to admit that the main purpose in getting hench is to become more attractive to women So yeah, sorry Lock me up. Next we have a few assumptions about emotions So it also says that you moved by rational thinking not emotions could you be a cold-hearted person? Hmm interesting. Morioms thinks I'm associate path. Chim chan said things I have no emotions and thick GS says you are not emotional. I think The emotions one-off are reasonable. I feel like I rarely experience negative emotions and when I do I can choose to explain them away. I am generally moved more my Move in that move to change my mind things more bear rational thinking and my emotions because it's just the way that I operate But I'm trying to get better at the emotions things well. I like I appreciate that. I don't know I feel like life could be come harder and less Kind of full if you don't acknowledge your emotions and I think I'm generally very bad at appreciating the emotions of other people And so that's an area that I want to get better at on the other hand We've got a few people who think Maggie for example You're a very emotional person, but you do not show it GS says you're actually an emotional person, but you don't show it that you are not to that common real life and you cry often times Okay, I'm actually not that emotional at all So it's the ones who so you think I have no emotions that I think are closer to the truth What was the last time I cried up? I often cry when I'm reading a book or when I'm reading and listening to an audio book and like there's like a really really really really epic scene like towards the end of every brand and Sanderson book in in particular There's this whole like avalanche of like absolutely epic stuff going on and often that brings tears to my eyes So that's usually when I cry next we have a few assumptions about stress So we've got you are stressed slash overwork most of the time and some other things I am too anxious to enjoy life but couldn't disagree more with those. I'm almost never stressed I never basically never feel overworked I can't even remember the last time I felt stressed I don't really know what the feeling of stress means because in my book like basically Everything I do especially when it comes to like non-medical related things I would be kind of acutely stressed if there were like a serious medical situation going on and if I didn't know what I was doing And if I couldn't get hold of some senior support and stuff like that that would be a stressful thing I would be slightly acutely stressed if I had like a long list of 20 20 things to do and there were patients waiting in the waiting room and then I'd be like all right cool That's a bang about this trying to see people in the most efficient order But beyond that I don't really get stressed out and I certainly never experienced chronic stress or anything like that I'm just quite fortunate and then the answer seems to think you've cracked how not to burn out But you haven't shared. I feel like I do share like I just don't burn out because a I'm just lucky And I'm reasonably neurotypical and all that stuff and I've never had to deal with them to help problems So that aside it's just that I feel like the secret to not burning out is just to enjoy the stuff that you're doing and For me, I think I'm I'm lucky enough to be at the point where I almost never have to force myself to do something that I'm not enjoying So basically everything I do in life is just fun Except like working out when we're on like the third the third set of stuff, but now I've got my trainer there to like push me on me Like you can do it you got this three more reps four more reps five more reps beyond that I just don't spend any time doing stuff. I don't enjoy and therefore it's hard it feels hard to burn out because of that I can be have some assumptions about friends So street matrices you're not friends with people who aren't good in studies What does a good in studies mean like most of the people I know Who most of my friends in school were very good at studying? We were all nerds, which is what I've had probably what broke brought us together I went to university at Cambridge and did medicine so basically everyone I knew there was good at studies Basically everyone I'm friends with now that I'm a doctor When I was well as sort of friends from work are all pretty good studying. I have friends who are youtubers I don't know or care how good they were at studying because like no one cares and I have friends through Twitter Again, I don't care how good they were at studies no one cares how good they are studies people like genuinely don't care Like no one gives a toss it's just that when you're in school and university you end up just naturally being surrounded by people who are Of the similar level of education. So most of my friends happen to be of a reasonably high level of education And then we've got a question from shutter XE murder who says you love making new friends But you rarely meet people who have the same interest as that as that of yours I do like making new friends. I don't know. I feel like I quite often meet people who have some of the interest to me Like I've got this standing offer on my website where kind of when it's not looked down if anyone comes to Cambridge I would Grab a coffee with them no questions asked and so through that I met loads and loads of people and so some of those some of those people have actually become friends And The sorts of people who would come and hang out with me in Cambridge are by default the sorts of people who would have the same interest as met as as main in various different domains I've also become friends with a lot of other creators through YouTube and Twitter and Instagram over the past few years and Whatever there are the interests the fact that we're all creators of some sort like ties us together and like a really nice way And so it feels like we have a lot more shared interests even if maybe they're not into sort of productive note taking as much as I am A load of assumptions now about me as a person so the first one is from book 1888 who says that you're lonely No, I don't feel lonely at all. We've got rad comuda who says you're a snob skipping the negative connotations around the term What does a snob mean? That's the time Snob a person with exaggerated respect for high social position or wealth who seeks to Associate with social superiors and looks down on those regarded as socially inferior I feel like I don't have an exaggerated respect people in the superior positions or people who are wealthy and I feel like I don't really seek to associate with people Maybe I did back in the day where I would have been like I would have wanted to be friends with someone who's like successful I don't know I don't know if even back in the day I don't really think I cared about that sort of stuff and looks down on those regarded as socially inferior I like to think that I don't really look down on anyone I feel like I'm just like generally very selfish and don't really think about other people so like you know Even if we accept the problematic framing of this is like socially inferior and socially superior If I came across someone who was socially inferior or or came across someone who was socially superior I just wouldn't really think about them unless I'm active be interacting with them I wouldn't think about them enough to look up to them or look down on them or anything like that So I'm not quite sure what snob means outside of that context PPR 1984 says you're very judgmental even though you don't mean to be again What does judgmental mean like I feel like I'm don't really make judgments on other people like I joke That people who use Android and Windows devices are humans. That's clearly a joke. How much is mental? I don't think I have I just don't again I just don't think about people in that way like if someone's doing something then You know you do you I honestly or like honestly could not give less of a toss about what you're doing with your life And I wouldn't even think to judge you for doing that like if you're doing something that actively hurts other people Then obviously I'm gonna judge you for that, but I don't think that's what the word judgmental mean That's defined. Just define judgmental Having or displaying an overly critical point of view. I don't really think I'm that critical at all like You can do what you want. I'm fairly judgmental towards myself and think I'm a waste man a lot of the time But it's all one out wants to be a waste man. That is entirely they're proactive And then Almond says you are a show off in real life Am I a show off in real life? I feel like we're all show off in real life to an extent We are all playing some kind of status a social status seeking game with other people some of us Signal our social status and our identity and all these things by I don't know doing things like wearing an apple watch or wearing a gym shark hoodie or like talking in a certain way or acting in a certain way like we're all signaling status in one way or another and The traditional way that people think that people signal status is oh you've got a Gucci belt or Gucci trousers Therefore you are signaling social status, but like we're all doing it in one way or another So I don't like to think that I'm a show off in real life That's my friend's probably won't say that I'm a show off in real life, and that's I'm doing it for banter like self-aggrandizing humorous Occasionally funny, but interesting interesting assumption next we've got her say his name who says despite all your success, you still seem to lack purpose and true happiness What does true happiness mean? I would define I was like happiness is like a And this mixture of kind of pleasure in the moment and contentment in the long term I think I have a lot of fun in the moment and I also think I'm reasonably content long term So I think I am truly happy whatever whatever that means You still seem to lack purpose. Yeah, I think that's fair to say I don't really have a north star Compass purpose meaning there will be a reason for me to be on this world I've I've started thinking a lot more about that than I did in the past, but I don't think I already have a sort of Fundamental purpose, so maybe that means I do lack purpose, but I would disagree that I Lack of true happiness and yeah, and it be also says you still haven't found the purpose of your life I agree some people say that well this this whole idea that every life is supposed to have one singular purpose Is a total myth and actually we're all just trying to make meaning in a lives in a different ways And I think I've brought the agree with that kind of viewpoint next we have good role It says you get irritated by slow people for example slow conversations in real life where you can't fast forward the thing No, I actually don't mind it when people speak slowly in real life It feels very natural. I mind it when people speak slowly in podcasts and in videos because well then I can speed it up But in real life, I'm more than happy people to speak slowly. It's all good Nied in says you enjoy helping others better themselves. I enjoy helping others And if they think that helps them better themselves then that's great, but I was I would also enjoy helping others do something that I don't know something totally waste man like I just feel like helping others is just generally fun. There's a nice phrase that I called a hedonic like Servantism or something like that where By helping others you also recognize that you're actually making your own self-filled good and so at any given crossroads Something I sometimes like to think is okay. What is the option here that would help the most people? And I know that's the option that's gonna make me feel the best as well. So occasionally I would choose that that path as well Rich says you don't put much care into appearances for example nice clothes shoes and hair products etc Broadly agree with that don't really care about I mean I care about wearing nice clothes But I don't really care about overthinking it. I care about wearing nice shoes As long as the comfortable end look reasonably okay, but I don't ever think it hair products I don't use hair products maybe I should use hair products maybe that would make my hair look a little bit better rather than Absolutely a mess, but yeah broadly I don't really care about those food pew says you're a great listener Thank you. I agree. I think I'm a pretty good listener and oh we've got loads of people giving comments about how tall they think I am Cheryl says you six but two Louis says tall AF Remi says are you a few six or tall user two three two one three of seven says you're five eleven, but claim to be six foot So this depends if I'm barefoot then I'm about five foot eleven and a half But if I'm wearing shoes then that goes up to six foot and so obviously on my dating profiles I ground it up to six foot Because I think yeah six foot when you're anxious. I think that's entirely reasonable. All right a few more so Lami says you are kind do gollus says you're a giver I eat compassionate with skills generous and naturally kind you deserve a super partner. Thank you pre-owned campuses you're extremely nice Malihar says you are super intelligent and a very kind soul. Thank you. That's all very kind I think I am pretty kind I may be not kind to myself sometimes I may be not kind to my immediate friends and family sometimes But I think I'm generally kind to like strangers and people I know this well and I like to think that I'm relatively generous and stuff Yeah, but I could be kind of to the kind of immediate people around Ed Parker says you feel strongly defined by your intelligence slash career status I felt like when I quit my job as a doctor temporarily I did lose some sense of Identity as being a doctor but like I suppose that's career status You feel like you're strongly defined by your intelligence. I don't think anyone really cares about my intelligence Like once you get get out of school and university where you're not kind of doing an exams and stuff And even in school me like genuinely no one cares. I don't feel my intelligence Whatever it might be defines me anyway personally Josu Jones says you find it hard to balance between Pakistani family expectations versus Western life models I feel like my me like my mom and my grandma and stuff like we don't really do the Pakistani family Expectations thing. I don't think so not really sure how to answer that we have a few assumptions about being a doctor So Beary Jackie says you're not interested in being a doctor anymore Little wood all says doesn't actually like being a doctor La Bina says that you really don't want to be a doctor anymore and Shutter Xima do says you're in a dilemma at the time We're joining the medical field and still you're unsure about it So I've been fairly open about this there are some aspects of being a doctor that are fun There are some aspects that are less fun and right now are like I did enjoy it It was fun for the two years that I was doing it full time If I could choose to design life however I wanted it being a doctor Five days a week would not be on that list If I could do if I could define a life and live it however I wanted then maybe being a doctor Maybe two or three Some way between one and three days a week. I think that would be on the list So I enjoy being a doctor but I would like to be a doctor part-time ultimately because I think Everything is more fun when you're doing it part-time all right We've got a few different assumptions about money now so Jacqueline says you're from a privileged background Landscaps says you inherited a lot of money from your parents. No, I did not Armored by Shell says you're posh and have a family back family with a wealthy background Define wealthy like my mom is a single parent who works as a doctor Makes us somewhat wealthy but like depends what you're what you're measuring stick is Rimshar says rich kid. I guess I'm from a privileged background in that my mum has valued education above everything else and we didn't really have to worry about money to The extent that some people do So to that extent my background is extremely privileged and I'm very grateful for it all right Loads and loads and loads and loads of more comments about money. So this is fun So always says you're extremely rich you're a millionaire you're really rich you are rich you're a millionaire You're a super rich you're rich you're like a thousand dollars per minute. No, you're very rich You have a million dollars in your checking account. Okay, again rich is always all relative I think I think I'm pretty rich my definition of rich is where money doesn't really Act as a limiting factor in the experience you want from your life honestly for me There are no there's basically nothing that I want that I need more money to buy It would be nice if I had like a super big house in London and then I could invite friends over But that does not keep me up at night in the slightest and so if we're defining rich Which is the way I define it, which is that money is not a limiting factor in my life experience Then yes absolutely I am rich for the record. I'm not a millionaire Yes Hopefully I'll happen someday, but I'm I'm not a millionaire right now and then Sofia says all you care about is getting rich Lord sorry don't mean any disrespect. I don't think getting rich is all I care about I do care about money to a big extent because money is the single biggest source of stress in a lot of people's lives and Having asked lots of doctors the question of if you want the lottery would you still be a doctor? And basically not a single person saying that they will still do it full time and the reason for them not doing it full time is because they don't have the money to quit And that has led me to prioritise making money and making passive income quite strongly in my own life because you know I think when you have money you have the freedom to then do do the work that you enjoy And I know a lot of people who are doctors and don't enjoy it as a full time job But they have to do it because of the money and that's a position that I never want to be if I give the impression that all I care about is getting rich You know, I would disagree that that's all I care about, but it is a big part of what I care about We've got a few assumptions about YouTube now, so I build a lot of Zikro says nothing to do else making videos Yeah, I make videos. I also do other things on the side, but for the most part these days I'm an unemployed bum who just makes internet videos so that's reasonably accurate Just Moriam says you like being recognized by your followers. Yeah, I actually love it. It's so good. It's so nice when I'm like Somewhere and people come up to me and say hey, I like your videos or like your podcast and stuff It's just it's just so sick. I love it. Especially when people come and hang out with me and want to meet with me in person because It can be a bit awkward at times. It's like a very quick encounter and I don't really know what to say If they're like, oh, I like your videos. I'm like, thank you. What's your name and what are you doing? I can tell that they don't really want to they just kind of want to say hi and maybe get a photo and leave or whatever But when people come to Cambridge to do my standing offer up or by anyone of coffee That's actually really fun and I love talking to people and then we can have more of an extended discussion that way and MALH QTR says you will eventually take a long break from YouTube I can't imagine I would maybe I will I reserve the right to do so, but for now I think YouTube benefits from consistency and I have a big proponent of consistency in everything in life Okay, a few different assumptions about my brother now. So we've got one from AJ bussy who says Deep inside you know that tame what my brother is the QTR and funny or brother QTR yeah, funny. Yes, I agree with that. It's not deep inside. I think it's a pifetti common knowledge and And an ace says you're worried that you're probably smarter than you I am not worried at all in the slater than I'd rather smarter than me. He probably is Instead of certain domains he probably isn't in certain domains Generally, I think he probably is smarter than me if we if it I feel like if we did both of us an IQ test He would probably come out slightly higher But it does not it's not something that worries me in the slightest. I could not care less how smart Or not I am rather to my brother and And perfumeology on this course says that you are your mother's favorite child Probably not she would say that she doesn't play favorites I would probably agree with that and now we have lots and lots of assumptions about love and relationships So let's check these out so lots lots and lots so we've got this guy has never tried touch to girl You've never been in a romantic relationship before your relationship history is dry and uninventiful You've never had a girlfriend you didn't have a girlfriend you never had a relationship You've never liked a girl you've never been on a date with the same woman more than once You've never dated you've never been through a heartbreak single at one of your life You don't have an ex you struggled to find a girl Thank you for all these assumptions people this guy has never touched a girl I hugged my friends occasionally I have I have a few more friends You've never been in a romantic relationship I have actually long relationship I was in was maybe about two or three months something like that I'm trying an eventful yeah, pretty unaboutful You've never liked a girl. I've definitely liked girls over the last several years You've never been on a date with the same woman more than once I have I've been on how many like second dates have I been on maybe like four or five or six I've lost count at this point but not that many you've been through a heartbreak I actually went through a heartbreak in like 2012 and that kind of felt like a heartbreak Could I I haven't since okay, we've got a few more right seems like a really nice guy that gets friends old a lot Lulled kind but friends own a lot you get friends own a lot. I disagree with the framing of the friends own If we're defining friends own hands your friends with someone and you like them and they just consider you a friend then that has happened once twice Three maybe three or four times in my life is that a lot? I don't know maybe this maybe doesn't So that's that racial says you don't have enough time to date Dahani says you have no time to date Victoria says you're so busy you may not have time to actually go into a Relationship of the girl and Justin says since you are so busy I see me don't have time to date. I've got plenty of time on my hands It's just that I don't go on a lot of dates Partly this is because it's it feels like too much effort Partly also it's because of the whole lockdown thing and like when I decided hey I should take this dating thing a bit more Seriously suddenly like coronavirus happened and then lockdown happened and so I haven't bothered with dating since then I like will be things of I don't have time It's like I think that's not that's not the way I think of it If I if I'm not doing something it's not because I don't have the time it's because I'm actively Choosing not to make the time and so mean not growing on many dates and not being bothered to To sort of engage particularly with with people on dating apps It's not because I don't have time because I do I've got time to sit here all day making internet videos It's because I choose to do other things with that time so I don't particularly agree with that kind of framing I don't have the time but yeah, all right these are fun ones So Aiman Charix says your V choose E when it comes to girls that's why you're single I don't know biggest company chooses as they say Fenton says you only date girls that are smart as you having studied IQ at one point when I was at university IQ is one of the trades that's most correlated between partners and so if we're accepting Smartness and that particular framing of it which is problematic to an extent then I probably would get along more with someone who is smart Or as much or as little smart as I am like a similar level of smartness if someone was significantly smarter than me They probably won't get along with me if I was significantly smarter than someone I imagine we probably wouldn't get on that well so like it this just had life works like if you like a most friendship group If you look at most marriages most relationships The people are generally matched on across a lot of different spheres and smartness if we're using if we're defining smartness to mean IQ According to the studies is one of the best Conserved trades across that so you only date girls that as far as you know I don't ask people what their GCC and other level and like a little greats are and they university careers before going on a date with them Basically the only criteria is do I think they're attractive and have they matched with me and that Well, they're happily happily going to date with someone Okay, a bit of pixels says you are looking for a girl like you that's why he was still single am I looking for a girl like me To be honest the only thing I'm looking for a girl is that I find them attractive and that we get on like if that is a girl like me Then the baby that's Tempy corazon says you are shy with girls, but at the same time quite picky No, what picky means? I would have picky means like if I think you're attractive and if I get on with you then then and it's all good Putry asses you're really picky when it comes to potential love interest I don't think about picky extremely picky when it comes to a partner you're eagerly awaiting for someone special You'd prefer a date someone in your nationality it would make a few things easier So all else being equal I would but it's a very minor preference and you do get moved by a lot of women But you were just very people. What does it put us move? Oh, moved You get moved by a lot of women, but you're just very picky I'm not gonna see someone in a friendly extended period of time unless I think there is like a long-term future with that person and so usually the things going through I'm either a do I find them attractive b do we get on and see can I imagine myself hanging out with them for an extended periods of time For like the next 40 years, you know like like all of dating is basically a numbers game for most of us Most people that we meet do not fit those three bills of Attractive I get on with them and I can see myself spending 40 years with them and so that leads to all of us in the dating game In the relationship market being picky about partners Rosario says you actually get many girls sliding in your DM But you just reject them all honestly I don't really I don't even see a lot of my DM is because I'd like they just come in way too fast into quickly and so I don't know Just if you do want to seriously get in touch with me then email marriage at alia.com and please send a photo Because if you just tell me about you then like come on It's so good like Denise FRRS says you get a ton of DMs from female subscribers wishing to date you I wouldn't know. I don't check my DMs like they did they're just too many to check email me if you actually want to date me Cardi Breeze says you have a lot of dating options, but signal that you don't you've got a few I don't go like 35 like some hinge right now 25 likes on hinge right now got I have restimated my when he puts Maddy Maddy says you can actually get girls but you like to pretend that you don't see you can see more hashtag relatable I don't know can I actually get girls what does it mean to get girls as well like So also it's a very problematic framing zone this and given that I may still want to lefty I disagree with the framing of a lot of these things Rayon Hawks says you smell like flowers and women love it I don't know to be honest I just get perfume recommendations from my friend Omar who runs a youtube channel towards school of sense link in the video description. He tells me what perfume to get so does it smell like flowers? I don't know this guy have 60 plus girlfriends no you actually get a ton of girls no makes it seem He's single and no girls like him when he's getting late daily. No. Thank you for that assumption For whatever that's worth okay a few different assumptions about romance so s s silvi says you're romantic And Sean Hunter says you love to spoil your significant other and our ingenuity lovely guy I don't really have a significant other. I wouldn't be keen on supporting them if that were the case Romantic I think I'm reasonably romantic Okay to saw Alan he says look for character in a woman first and only then judge if you're attracted Oh no I first judge if I'm attracted to them and then I look for character and personality and Imagine whether we get on maybe that's a bad way of going about it But to be honest most of the girls I meet or I see these days or on dating apps where actually It's very difficult to get to know someone's character through a profile and is it on a dating app and a lot easier to see It make a snap decision of am I attracted to this person and so for me kind of the looks Am I attracted to you comes first and then the personality thing comes secondarily? That's probably bad. I probably should try and change that mode thinking but It is what it is now story of Val you find girls who are inter productivity more likeable slash hot Not only I find them more hot if they're inter productivity more likeable If they're inter productivity we probably get on a bit better because I'm inter productivity and therefore I'd probably like them a bit more So let's fair today tons and tons of comments about So let's see you have a love interest you found a girl using Miss match You have a secret girlfriend you're in a relationship you're in a relationship but pretend to be single to fit your nerdy Loader walk a holly vibe. Wow, you have a secret girlfriend you have a secret girlfriend you're dating someone You are getting married soon. You secretly have a girlfriend he he you have a secret girlfriend and you have a secret Wow a lot of people think I have a secret girlfriend for the record. I do not have a secret girlfriend That's all the risk to say on that front Vinnie tells us you're moving to America to find a wife I'm having second thoughts about moving to America Therefore it is a rude point about whether I don't know if I've used that word in the right context It is it is moot weather. I'm going to America to find a wife or not I study by a man says you're wanting to marry a doctor and Subbex as you'll marry a doctor Uh, I don't know. Maybe again This comes down to like personality match all else being equal I'd be more likely to get on with someone who's a doctor than someone who is not a doctor just because we probably have more things in common But I certainly wouldn't say no to marrying someone who's not a doctor. Oh, this is interesting Udo Cafe 10 tell man says you are scared to be loved and Ania says you can be insecure around women I think I can't be reasonably insecure around women I think all guys are insecure around attractive women to an extent or at least women they find attractive That's true of me as well. We're definitely gone better at this over over time I can't remember the last time I felt insecure around a woman but it's it would probably happen at some point And you're scared to be loved but I think so. I think I'm scared to be loved at all For whatever that was worth that was several assumptions about me if you liked this video and you Still at the end of this video for whatever reason they click there And if you haven't seen it that is my original assumptions video when we talk a lot more about money And about relationships which seem to be the two most things that most people care about which I guess makes sense But otherwise, thank you for watching please do hit the subscribe button if you're already and I'll see you in the next video. Bye
