## Transcript
 One of guys, welcome back to the vlog. The next day is going to be quite exciting because we are taking part in the death and dying symposium where we are only kind of break bad news. It's going to be two solid days of kind of working with actors who are trained to cry on their mind and yeah we're just going to learn the techniques and how to tell people that they're dying, how to tell people that a lot of ones are dying and generally how to be better doctors. Alright guys, so this is the two-day death and dying course and I'd like to introduce you to Steve, who's one of the CCS, the clinical community at Caching and Sales coordinators. Okay, so we've got the two-day course which is a mixture of lectures and experiential sessions. The purpose of it is to get you as a medical student to think about challenges that you will face when you're in your early years as a doctor. The ideas for you to get as much experience and exposure to these things as we can provide. Okay, so we're fast forwarding a few weeks into the future because I want to explain a little bit more in depth about what goes on in our communication skill sessions and some of the stuff we learned about breaking bad news and about dealing with patients towards their end of life in part of medicine. The main problem next year everyone does the she's saying she wants, she's looking forward very much to me walking her down the aisle after you think I'll be able to do that. So before we talk about that, kind of just find out how much you've been told about your conditions so far. So here Paul is assessing the patient's starting point and this is always the first step in any kind of breaking bad news type situation. We've all heard horror stories of doctors who haven't seen a patient before going on to the ward and saying, you know, talking to them about the next step in their cancer treatment and the patient is like, oh, what can't so, because no one had told them before that they actually had cancer in the first place and we deal with situations we definitely want to be avoiding. So step number one in breaking bad news always establish a patient starting point which Paul has done very well over here. I will definitely answer on the other question and we'll try to work on what we can do, but first I just need to ask you a little bit more about what you've been told about your condition. I've been told that my heart is... Another thing that's good to do while breaking bad news is to throw out warning shots because what we don't want to do is to drop the bombshell of the bad news on the patient in one go. We want to kind of build them up to expect that it's coming. So the first thing that we can do is take them into a side room and there was said that you should never break bad news when someone's in a corridor or someone's in the ward. If possible, we want to be taking them into a side room and just the act of doing that is kind of a warning shot in itself because the patient knows that something serious is coming and one other way of doing it is to ask the patient to explain in the wrong words how their condition has been deteriorating over time. So for example, you might ask six months ago how are you feeling relative to how you're feeling now and then they would kind of explain the deterioration and that in itself would also be a warning shot that they would know that they would know that they would know in themselves that their condition is not improving and it's getting worse and you know we want to be getting these expectations in early so that when we do break the bad news it doesn't come as too much of a surprise to the patient. So we're definitely going to do everything we can to keep you going into that but I do have to be honest with you with the state of view of what the state of your heart and and your other health problems. April is a long way away and with the state of of your heart and and everything else we're not sure if if you'll make it until then. So after each student has their turn with a role player they come back into the circle and everyone gives them feedback so I just start they work out a few things that they want to want to focus on so in all of my sessions I always ask people to look out for if I'm talking too fast because that's something I have a tendency to do so we come back into the circle and we discuss with with the role player who's who's still in character and with everyone else and what we did well what we could have done differently. I thought I went all right yeah I would have liked to give you a number but I feel like you weren't really asking for a number and I didn't want to kind of just ask the doctor if you put yourself in his shoes actually with the information which would really help him will be to actually name the priority your priorities and you want to be at your dots and dots and dots of sweating so we should work towards making sure that you are your dots of sweating and to for that to happen you need to have a good grasp of how severe your condition is. Also CCS stuff can sometimes be quite heavy especially in a session like this where we're breaking bad news we're telling this guy that he's not going to make it to his daughter's wedding so I think having having like a group of friends there to kind of do it together is is a really nice way of going about it. I feel like if it were kind of one to one that would be a little bit too intense maybe we do have one to one occasionally a couple of times a year but in general CCS has done as part of a group and we'll obviously take it seriously but we can also have a bit of a laugh a bit of a joke around just to like you know not make it make it too much if that makes sense we had a really friendly group supportive group and it's kind of a safe space where you can make mistakes and yeah you might joke about it in the group but you know trust that no one's going to really bad mouth you to your friends to your colleagues and stuff so I really like CCS personally it's a good fun and we also learn quite a lot as well. So what you've seen so far was our first session of the morning the second session was where we had to discuss DNA CPR that's do not attempt to cardio pulmonary resuscitation that's one of those interesting things where technically whether or not we do CPR on a patient if their heart does stop technically that's a medical patient can't demand to be resuscitated but having said that we still have that conversation with them where we explain what we think is in their best interests and you know take take their opinion and their families opinion into account so that that can be quite a quite a tricky, tricky conversation at times because you can imagine if you're attending a patient that a lot of times patients can interpret that as that we're giving up on them on that we're not going to do our best to treat them in other ways but like in in reality CPR is is so rarely successful I think the figures are about like 7% success rate CPR is not as a life saving a measure as it can seem on on grades anatomy and things and actually someone has actually done a study where they lived at the survival rate of CPR in television dramas versus in real life in front of those massive disparities. Generally it's that conversation that we have to have with the patients so this was quite a tricky one and that was what the afternoon session was about. But for some people especially if they have underlying health problems it can do more harm than good to be honest. So that was day one of our death in dying course. We also had a few lectures kind of scattered in about treatment of patients towards the end of life about palliative care so we're going to cut to a shot of past tense me talking about what some of these lectures were about and going to sharing my thoughts on it at the time. We had two lectures which were both really really good. The first one was about managing breathlessness as a symptom towards the end of life so apparently breathlessness is a symptom that other patients experience and counterintuitively oxygen doesn't help. Although everyone thinks oxygen helps and the consultant in palliative care which is kind of taking us through the evidence and you know it seems as if it's the non-pharmacological approaches that really do help. So for example, blowing a fan in your face is a far better way of relieving breathlessness than just putting loads of oxygen on. Apparently drugs like benzodiazepines aren't that useful either. It tends to be more than non drug approaches that do make a difference towards the end of life but sadly those are the ones that require time and engagement on the part of both the doctor and the patient which means unfortunately in a lot of NHS hospitals they're already done that that much so she was just trying to get us to appreciate and those are the important things. The second lecture we had was wonderful it was from this awesome consultant in any medicine she was talking about the ethics of end of life care so things like assisted suicide in youth in Asia and DNA CPR forms and how you deal with these conversations then we were going through some cases in the law that have kind of really shaped the way the law is the law is handled in the UK so that was super super interesting. So that was day one of our death and dying course day two were actually even more challenging than day one but before we go there we're going to have a little montage to the standard epic music of Katherine Cooking some Ty Green Curry where which we have for dinner that evening and yeah I hope you enjoy this quick montage of food here we go. Oh my goodness these onions made the judgment off the block what do we think about this year barely. It's at least like 24 weeks. Okay so hope you enjoyed that cheek little montage of Cooking my mom sometimes says that my vlogs of life is medical student are more cooking and food vlogs then they are medical student stuff but hey I enjoy filming and editing the sequences they'll be fun to look back on a few years time so now we're going to finish off this episode by going back to me from the past where I was talking about what we learned on day two of the course. Okay so we're just finished day two of the death and dying course the morning was quite interesting we were tasked with telling a patient so this was an actual patient obviously that her son her 21 year old son had died in a car accident so that was super challenging because each of the six of her six of us practice telling the patient and each time she responded in a slightly different way so for one of the people she broke down trying for another one she was just kind of shell shopped silent for a third she was quite kind of blaming an angry and and all that so it was really useful to kind of get experience of that because that this whole kind of breaking bad news especially in the event of a sudden death of someone really young telling a mother that his son is died in a car accident that's like a super big deal so the fact that we kind of got some practice of it now in our finally year before having to do it in real life I think that was super useful. After that we had a lecture about palliative care at home so there are some patients who are in the last few days of their life all last few weeks a month of their life who would prefer to die at home rather than hospitals and the point the doctor boggling the lecture made was that in the last hundred years or so we've really overmedicalised and institutionalised death and birth as well back in the day most births and deaths happened at home now most births and deaths happened in a hospital anyway. When patients are approaching their end of life we ideally want to keep them out of hospital because you know it's expensive to keep people in hospital and out of hospital you know patients often prefer to die at home so we were going over the various things that we can do sort of working with McMillan nurses, my recurring nurses, hospital worker social care, hospital home that's sort of thing to kind of make patients comfortable in their last days of life while they're at home and then in the afternoon we had a communication seal session talking to the wife of a patient who was dying and answering her questions so in the scenario that I got she she was asking things like will it you know will be in distress you can hear some rattling breathing the death rattle that's colloquially known and she was kind of naturally worried about this um in another one of the scenarios uh the person's wife was saying that she really doesn't want to have the body at home at all and you know we should just call her and be let's take it away and at that point we had to kind of explain to her that actually you know it's he probably won't survive a trip to hospital and really just trying to explore her concerns find out why she was worried about keeping him at home and then use that knowledge to try and kind of bring her around to the idea that it's okay that her husband dies at home because that's that's what he wanted so that brings us to the end of the two-day death and dying course I think overall it was it's been really really useful breaking bad news is always something that I feel medical students are scared of and even I remember when applying for medicine the idea of having to do like a station breaking bad news in an MMI that like was really quite scary and from teaching interviews for the last five years that's like the one station that I know every student is like dreading that oh how do you break bad news so we've just had some intensive practice of it in our final year and I think it's been really useful in preparing us for life as junior doctors if you've watched this far then thank you so much for watching you're amazing if you like the video please give it a thumbs up if you haven't subscribed to the channel please consider doing so more vlogs coming up every week along with applying to medicine videos if you're into that sort of thing have a lovely day and I will see you next time bye you
