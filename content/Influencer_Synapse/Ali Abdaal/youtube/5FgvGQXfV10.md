## Transcript
 Hey friends, welcome back to the vlog, it's Valentine's Day and so of course this is going to be a super productive day in my life. The day starts at 8.30 a.m. as I'm rudely awakened by my iPhone alarm. But because this is a special day of romance and relaxation, I get back into bed and watch some videos on the YouTube. I'm watching Graham Stefan reacting to David Dobrik's new home and then I browse Instagram to see if I've got any Valentine's Day messages. Sadly, I have none. So, after an hour of screwing around on my phone, at 9.30 I decide to stop being a complete waste man and shower and change into my special Valentine's Day outfit. This is a new t-shirt courtesy of my friends at Agmunk who make the best desk setup accessories too. Next, I do my usual skincare routine, moisturizing and using an eye cream. And of course, I'm using my million subscribers' plaque as a mirror because I need the reminder that I've got friends. I head into the living room and open my first Valentine's Day gift. A balloon, which it turns out, was sent to me by mother because she feels sorry for me. Then it's time to make some American style blueberry pancakes in preparation for my move to the US at some point in life. I add in the flower, baking powder, salt, milk, and eggs, and whisk it into a smooth, creamy batter. At one point, the recipe calls for a knob of melted butter. So first, I google to find out what the hell a knob is and then I figure out a way to melt the butter. I feel the microwave would be a reasonable way to melt butter, which then goes into the mix, which I whisk like a maniac. Then I spend 20 minutes making the pancakes like the domestic goddess that I am. We decorate them with golden syrup and fresh blueberries and tuck in. Around 11 a.m., my brother and I hop online to record this week's episode of our award-winning podcast Not Over Thinking. We discuss the emotional roller coaster I've been on this week, with lots of issues with the book that I'm writing. We spend some time talking about his startup and some of the struggles with that. And we end with a therapy session where I read out some of the mean comments that I've seen about myself on the Tattel Life website and analyzing how that makes me feel. His life seems both exhausting and a bit sad. The constant quest to be productive every nanosecond because you've got nothing else going on. Oh my goodness. Wow, this is brutal. After I wipe my tears reading these mean comments on the internet, we wrap up the podcast at 1 p.m. To make myself feel better, I open a Valentine's Day card from my housemate Sheen. Nope, Valentine's Day ¬£2 for a nice. There's no one. I'd rather ignore what we both want from her. Dear Ali, everyone loves you, including me. Thank you for making 2020 less sucky and for everything else. Lots of love from your King Sheen. Oh, that's so sweet. Look at that. This card is recyclable, right? Spreading the bed. Oh, miss. Then Sheen gives me a nice pep talk and we talk about my feelings about these mean comments and how it's okay to admit if they make me feel bad and it doesn't necessarily infringe on my masculinity to admit it. I didn't film that bit of the conversation because I have to maintain an image of being a stoic sage here on YouTube. Anyway, at 2 p.m. I hop on Zoom to have a catch up call with some friends from medical school. We talk about what's going on with our lives and as usual, they ask me how my quest to find a wife is going. I tell them that my chances of getting married this year are similar to the chances that the pope converts to Islam. While I'm on the Zoom call, Sheen is very kindly baking a cake which we're going to decorate later in the day. She's absolutely not using a cake mix, obviously, and creating all the ingredients from scratch as she has forced me to say. After the Zoom session with my friends, I hop back to my natural habitat, my desk to bash out some work. We've got cohort 2 of the part-time YouTuber Academy starting tomorrow and so I'm sorting out some last-minute prep to hopefully help make things run smoothly. At 430 it's time to relax with a cup of tea, my iPad and the Kindle app, where I'm reading Stephen Pressfields the artist's journey. I start to feel a bit lithoric and I think about going for a run, but then I decide against it because I'm not a complete widow. Instead, I film Sheen decorating the cake and we spend some time doing a photo shoot for her Instagram. Then at 6 p.m. I hop on a Zoom call for the not-over-thinkers, the private community that my brother and I have started around our podcast. It's a good session with around 15 of us, where we have a chat chat about meaning and purpose and how to figure out what to do with your life, and where I share my woes about struggles with my book, and how bad these mean internet comments have made me feel recently. Thankfully, it's a very supportive community and we have a lovely discussion. By the way, if you're not following my weekly podcast that I host with my brother, you should subscribe to the not-over-thinking YouTube channel, and you can also find us on Spotify and every other podcast platform isn't that fun. At 7 p.m., Sheen and I spend 30 minutes deciding what to take away to order, and then once we've decided on our favorite Indian cuisine, I do a bit of practice on the recorder, which I bought yesterday to help drive out the neighbors. At 8 p.m., I'm super healthy and nutritious Indian takeaway arrives, which we gobble down while watching two episodes of the mentalist. And then from 9 to 9 30 p.m., I do some more recorder practice, and then spend some time replying to comments on my latest video and face-timing mother because I'm such a good son. At 10 p.m., it's time for our special Valentine's Day wine-down routine. So, we both change into our robes, don't eye headbands and apply a face mask. Unfold the mask gently apply. I'm about to put in a tear it open. Not unfolded. There is a plastic inside. I should have washed my hands after doing a wee. What is it? I don't understand. Open air. It's going to be a face. It's not, it's not creepy. Yeah, what? This is really creepy. Now take your glasses off. That's also for your eyes. No, it looks weird. You have to put it properly. What? I have. You have to put the upper lip on the upper lip. What is your problem? It looks terrible right now. What are you doing? I put that on your mustache. What? The thing that's on your upper lip right now. I must touch this one. There you go. Press, don't be scared to press into your skin. Oh, why do you break? Did you break it? Not this, the rest of the mask. Oh, yes. Yes. Press it everywhere. So, I'll do it. All right. How are we doing? Is this good? What do I need to do? I feel like maybe your nose is too big. That's the problem. Wow. All right, that'll do. That'll look beautiful. This is the perfect setup for watching Bridget Joan Styrie as we're both single on Valentine's Day, which is apparently what one does when one is in that position. Because one is supposed to drown one sorrows on Valentine's Day, I decide to finish a whole bottle of slur on my own as well. The film lasts a central midnight at which point we spend another 30 minutes procrastinating from brushing our teeth, and then I spend around 15 minutes offloading the footage from this vlog. Because I've still got a burst of energy at the end of the day, the final order of business in this supremely productive Valentine's Day, is spending half an hour working on a video that I'm writing, which is a guide to Bitcoin and how to get started investing in crypto. This is something I've been doing since 2017, and I always get comments from people asking about my thoughts on crypto. To help plan out this video, I'm continuing to work through an online course over at Brilliant who are very kindly sponsoring this video. If you haven't heard by now, Brilliant is a fantastic platform with online courses in maths, science, and computer science. Their courses are engaging in interactive, and they teach you stuff in a really first principle fashion, so you're never just memorizing information like we often tend to do in school. These days, I'm working through their excellent course on cryptocurrencies. It starts off with a brief history of currency itself, which is a great foundation to understanding what's so great about crypto currencies. We then go through the concepts of cryptographic signatures, decentralization, and vulnerabilities. This course has really been helping me get a foundational grasp of cryptocurrencies, so that I can make more videos about them in the future, and also to be a bit more confident in my own investments. If you'd like to join me on this journey of improving our mental faculties and understanding these important concepts in maths, science, and computer science, head over to Brilliant.org slash alley.

If you liked it, you should definitely check out this short playlist of some of my other ridiculously productive days in the life. Thank you for watching. Happy Valentine's Day, and I'll see you later.
