## Transcript
 Hey friends, welcome back to the channel. In this video we're going to be reviewing the 2020 MacBook Air 13-inch and because I'm a fan of upfront conclusions and saving your time I'm just going to come out and say if you're in the market for a laptop then this is probably the laptop that you should get because it's amazing and absolutely every single way except for one which I'll talk about later in the video and honestly in addition to the 15-inch MacBook Pro and my 12.9-inch iPad Pro I would consider just buying one of these just as an everyday carry sort of thing because this MacBook Pro is a bit big the iPad Pro is good but it doesn't it's not quite a laptop replacement just yet more on that in a future video but this is just absolutely perfect. It's the great size to carry around it's the absolutely perfect laptop if you're interested in doing basic things and that's going to be the main point in this video that this is a perfect laptop if you're doing basic things and so if you're in the market for one of these laptops you want to be asking yourself right? Recently what are my use cases for a laptop and preferably we want a laptop that's going to be lasting us at least three years if not more so you also want to ask yourself can I feasibly envision myself only having basic computer needs for the next three or four years? So what do I mean by basic things? I basically mean anything that's not particularly fancy so you know things like browsing the web or watching Netflix or typing up a word document or watching a laptop videos on YouTube or making a PowerPoint presentation for work or school or you know crunching some numbers in Microsoft Excel or in Google Sheets or watching an other class on Skillshare or sending and receiving email or doing the occasional zoom call or maybe even watching other videos and other websites those are all fairly basic things that this MacBook Air does absolutely amazingly but if you're thinking of doing not very basic things so things like video editing that's not particularly basic this is gonna sort of handle that somewhat well but it becomes very slow very quickly and that's very frustrating as a video editor gaming this is not a laptop for gaming but if you're in really into games you probably already know that photo editing graphic design yeah it sort of works if your workflow is very basic but if you're trying to import any reasonable size stuff onto Lightroom or do any kind of manipulation in Photoshop it's gonna start slowing down and if this is the laptop that you're gonna be using for the next three or four years you don't want it to be slowing down doing any of the basic things that you're gonna be doing feasibly in that time and so the question to be asking isn't is this a good laptop because obviously it's a great laptop and this tons of reviews talking about how amazing this is and actually for the first time since 2012 now when someone asks me I'll say what laptop should I get my answer is gonna be just get a MacBook Air and I haven't been able to say that for the last eight years because Apple has done all sorts of weird things to the MacBook lineup with 12 inch MacBook and the MacBook Pro's and the weird butterfly keyboards and Windows laptops started to not suck beyond 2012 but now the MacBook Air is so good that this is now my default recommendation for laptop once more to be honest the Microsoft Surface is very good as well the Dell XPS is very good as well there's all sorts of really good Windows laptops in this sort of price point that are very good the question is what do you want to use a laptop for because if you want to be doing any of this fancy stuff you should probably shut up for a MacBook Pro but I probably wait right now until the 14 inch MacBook Pro comes up with the proper keyboard because if you want to get a proper keyboard you'll need to get the 16 inch version which costs like $2,500 minimum and that's just too much money to spend on the laptop unless you're like a genuine professional user anyway so that was the discussion about kind of what we used the laptop before like I said this is really good for basic stuff let's just break down a little bit of the kind of components of the laptop in case people care about that thing so you know let's start with the keyboard the keyboard is absolutely fantastic I'm going to do a typing test now and in real time you'll see how amazing this keyboard is so oh here we go like 152 words per minute I've been doing typing tests for a long time and this was just the first one that I did today I promise I haven't done multiple takes of this with my Apple Magic keyboard with my kind of fancy colorful mechanical keyboard the most I sort of get when I've been doing these tests for the last few days and testing under different keyboards has been about mid 140s words per minute so maybe there was some element of luck there but you know that's a pretty high typing speed if I say so myself so I am very attuned to what a good keyboard is and this keyboard is fricking amazing like I'm so glad that this is the key one of these things because with the old bus flag keyboards on the MacBook Pro's I didn't hate it that much and I could get some pretty reasonable typing speeds on that sort of 13140 words per minute but as soon as I laid my fingers on this new keyboard mechanism that they introduced in the 13 inch air and the 16 inch Pro I was like oh my god I now know what I've been missing this is incredible secondly the track pad back in the day back in 2012 Apple laptops with the only ones that had decent track pads in that time things have changed and you know Windows laptops now have decent track pads as well but this is just as good a track pad if not better then it's been for the last pretty much a decade so there's basically nothing to fault with this track pad like it's responsive it's great the gesture is a nice it's a used like force type so it's when you click on it it doesn't you like you aren't actually clicking it's just kind of giving you some haptic feedback but these track pads are been doing that for years they you know if it's if it's not broken don't fix it like the track pad is just as good as it's always been 30 let's talk about the screen and the screen is absolutely fine it's a retina display it's got like a 2560 by 1440 resolution I think 400 nits of brightness which you really know is what these numbers mean but basically 400 nits is bright but not very bright so if you're using it outside an absolutely broad daylight bright sunlight you might not be able to see very clearly but it's absolutely bright enough for most like 98% of other use cases which is absolutely fine and it's a retina display it still has slightly annoyingly large bezels which if you look at modern windows laptop sometimes they don't but hey you know maybe they'll update the design for that next time but yeah the screen is just it's just fantastic. Fourthly the ports this is I suppose one disadvantage of it you've only got two USB-C ports but to be honest for most people and for most use cases two USB-C ports is more than enough most people with MacBooks or with any sort of USB-C devices are going to be using one of these donbles this is what I connect various USB accessories too but this go then a USB port on this MacBook Pro for someone like me two USB ports is a bit annoying because often I use all four of these ones up on my 15-inch MacBook Pro so I've got this connected to this huge just monitor I've got this one connected to wired ethernet going all the way through my apartment to plug in so I can stream at decent kind of gigabits per second I've got one USB dongle and I've got another USB-C hard drive connection that's probably more ports than most normal people who need to use so two USB ports is absolutely reasonable we also interestingly have a headphone jack yeah I mean honestly I can't really remember the last time I had to use a wide pair of headphones but if you're one of those old school people you've got the headphone jack there the speakers speakers are very reasonable there's other videos on YouTube where they do tests of speakers I don't know you can really do a test of speakers because then it also depends on microphone quality and it also depends on what what's going through your own speakers there's all sorts of different issues with that but yeah the speakers are fine if you're going to watch an immersive movie or something you should probably wear headphones or use external speakers to be honest that's going to be true regardless of what laptop you get and you know for watching YouTube videos are watching my classes on Skillshare.com link in the video description the speakers are absolutely fine microphone wise yeah microphone is reasonable apparently the pretty good these days so this is a test of the microphone on the MacBook Air and recording on the voice members up and this is what the microphone sounds like from this 500 dollar microphone set up that I'm using kind of up the top so you can hear for yourself again the microphone is very reasonable for doing basic things like FaceTime and Zoom and remote working and all that kind of stuff and then there's the webcam the webcam's a bit crap it's 720p I noticed this when I was FaceTimeing my mum yesterday and earlier today and you know I'm I'm used to having a super high quality camera on my iPhone 11 Pro Max front facing and back facing so FaceTime is super HD on the iPhone when doing Zoom calls I'm used to having this Logitech 1080p HD camera I like webcam but this is about 50 pounds this is kind of kind of a bit crap I mean let's show what this would look like so yeah this is kind of what the webcam looks like you can see there's loads of noise those are raining the background but I mean it's a webcam what you use a webcam for no one really needs to see a face and full HD like super HDR when you're on a Zoom call unless you just want to do that for fun so it gets a job done I would like it if the webcam were a little bit better but hey we can't have it all sadly and now let's talk about the only thing I dislike about this and that is the thermal performance is a little bit annoying and by that I mean that as you start doing kind of more intensive sort of tasks on this you know having loads of loads of tabs open or trying to edit a foot in light room or having like chrome and safari and slack and zoom open at the same time doing this sort of multiple application thingy the processor gets very hot and you can download add-ons like turbo boost switcher to check what the what the temperature of the processor is and I was finding that this processor the i3 version the dual core version was easily getting up to 100 degree Celsius especially when I was sitting on the sofa with this in my lap kind of sitting on my black jeans with the jeans sort of obscuring the which is often like the position that I would use a laptop in and I was finding that the fans were getting annoyingly loud now this is only really a problem if you're going to be stretching the laptop and you're going to be kind of using it on a surface where the thermals are not where kind of the air vents are covered up so like if you're wearing jeans or something and using it in your lap but I think that is a scenario that a lot of people are using the laptop in and honestly if this fan issue wasn't a thing basically the reason it happens is because something's happening on the insides of the MacBook and there's other YouTube videos that explain this but it basically means that the efficiency of heat transfer to the outside environment is not very good and so the processor tends to heat up and in order to kind of make it cool down a bit the fans have to spin really really really really loudly and I'm just not really used to hearing loud laptop fans like unless I'm streaming and editing and doing loads of stuff on this MacBook Pro I just don't hear even a hint of fan noise and yet we're doing kind of basic things on the MacBook Air I was hearing some fan noise so there are ways around it you can use an add-on like turbo boost switcher to disable turbo boost which keeps the processor powered down a little bit that means it does get a little bit slower if you're really really taxing it it's one of those issues that's the only negative thing that I can really think of with this laptop apart from that everything is fantastic and in fairness you know I was using this all evening on the sofa like over there in my lap and I didn't hear a fan once even without using the add-on so it's it seems to kind of vary depending on what you're doing but the fan issue is a little bit annoying so if you really really don't like the idea of hearing a fan noise occasionally maybe this isn't the laptop view so that was all the features let's talk about recommended configurations now and this starts at 999 to basically a thousand dollars but you can knock off a hundred dollars or a hundred pounds off the price tag if you're a student so the base model if you're a student is nine hundred pounds or nine hundred dollars but the base model has the i3 processor which is basically dual course only has two cores but if you pay an extra hundred pounds or hundred dollars you upgrade to the i5 processor which has four cores and it's very much worse upgrading that because they're just sort of future proofs that laptop a little bit more and it's only a hundred pounds for that upgrade the other thing that I would get is I would upgrade the RAM from eight gigabytes to 16 gigabytes and that does cost two hundred dollars or two hundred pounds but as we said we're going to be keeping this device for the next three or four years at least and upgrading the RAM is one of the best things that you can do to increase the longevity of a laptop so overall the total cost of this would be twelve ninety nine so one thousand two hundred ninety nine dollars or thirteen hundred pounds minus a hundred pounds if your students are basically twelve hundred quid twelve hundred pounds twelve hundred dollars whatever currency you want to convert that into so that would be my recommended configuration I would suggest that if you can't afford twelve hundred pounds then maybe don't go for a MacBook Air maybe consider a Windows laptop instead because you can get cheaper options that do basically the same thing if you're getting a MacBook Air you're getting it because you like Mac OS as an operating system and probably because you have other Apple devices that synergize nicely with a MacBook kind of as you're as you're made laptop so that's what I would suggest basically the minimum price that you upgrade this should be if again you know as we said we wanted to last three four years I would be tempted to buy one of these and if you're in the market for a laptop you can't really conquer wrong this is the one to get not being paid for Apple to say this I wish I were I wish Apple sponsored my videos but unfortunately they don't despite where everyone thinks this is just really solid and I've been using MacBook since 2012 when I first got the MacBook Air and they're basically never let me down I'll put a playlist up here that has some other videos about kind of iPad versus MacBook type things and also video about my favorite apps to install on Mac OS that you should definitely check out thanks for watching and see you in the next video bye bye
