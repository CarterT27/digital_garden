## Transcript
 When we're looking at successful people, whether in sports, entertainment or anything else really, it's tempting to think that the reason for their success is talent. They've got something special, something we can't replicate and that's their secret source. But what if it's not really about talent? What if instead? They're successful because of trades and skills that any of us can develop. That's a question we're tackling in this episode of Book Club, the series where we distill and discuss highlights from some of my favorite books and today we are talking about grit by Angela Duckworth, White Passion and Resilience are the secrets to success. Angela is a psychologist at the University of Pennsylvania and she spent the last decade exploring the idea of grit. With examples from the US military, sports, business and education coupled with evidence from psychology and neuroscience. Of course, she explains how we often place too much emphasis on talent and not enough emphasis on passion and perseverance, which are key components of what she calls grit. One of the opening ideas in the book is that we all have a natural talent bias. She quotes the immortal words of German philosopher Friedrich Hinitscher. He said, our vanity, our self-love promotes the cult of the genius. For if we think of genius as something magical, we are not obliged to compare ourselves and find ourselves lacking. He's saying that we all mythologize this idea of talent because if we can explain away someone's success as being down to just talent, it means that we can use that as an excuse. We don't have to do the hard work in putting the effort ourselves. In the book, our friend Angela introduces two equations that help this sink in talent multiplied by effort equals skill and skill multiplied by effort equals achievement. Then using algebraic substitution or whatever the hell it's called, we can derive the equation achievement equals talent multiplied by effort multiplied by effort. Therefore achievement equals talent times effort squared. And that leads us to one of the main points in the book that yes, talent is important, but actually effort counts twice. Actually, I think effort probably counts more than twice because if you square effort, it's like any effort you put in gets squared which gets multiplied by self it gets compounded and that's more than two to never mind. This idea of that effort counts twice leads to the main idea of the book which is unsurprisingly grit. And Angela has done lots of research into loads of different fields. And what she's found is that whichever domain we're looking at, the most successful people have these two things in common. Firstly, they're unusually resilient and hard working. And secondly, they had a deeply held belief and a knowledge of what it was they wanted. Actually says in the book, these paragons of grit not only had determination, they had direction as well. She concludes that this combination of perseverance and passion leads to sustained long-term effort. And those things, she calls grit. So now that we know what grit actually is and that effort counts twice as much as talent, how can we develop our own gritty mindset? Well, in the book, Angela says that grit is not a fixed quality, we can all develop grit in different ways. And she argues that there's basically four components of grit that we can all work on. Firstly, we have interest. Now passion is the first component of the grit equation, but actually to develop a passion, we first need to be interested in and enjoy what we do. As Jeff Bezos famously said, whatever it is that you want to do, you'll find in life that if you're not passionate about what it is you're working on, you won't be able to stick with it. I think this is really great. And this is basically the same idea as my concept of the fun factor which is part of my productivity equation that'll be linked more in a video up there. And there's another really good quote from the book that I often come back to. And that is passion for your work is a little bit of discovery followed by a lot of development and then a lifetime of deepening. This is really good stuff. This is the answer for all those people out there who are like, well, my passion is sitting at home playing PlayStation or reading paranormal romance or whatever, like you're not going to find your passion by sitting at home like a lemon. You're going to find it by trying out new things, stepping outside your comfort zone. It's a little bit of discovery, then a lot of development, and then a lifetime of deepening. Ah, that is so good. I should write that down. The next key part is practice or most specifically daily deliberate practice, which helps build the foundation of perseverance. Angela says that every gritty person she's interviewed had the Japanese concept of Kai's aunt, which literally translates to continuous improvement. But it's not just about putting in the hours of practice, it's also important how we practice. Angela draws in research by psychologists and as Ericsson, who has studied peak performers and loads of successful people, and found that they do this thing called deliberate practice, which is made up of four components. Firstly, a clearly defined stretch goal, secondly, full concentration and effort, number three, immediate and informative feedback, and number four repetition with reflection and refinement. So, by engaging in this form of deliberate practice, we can more fully embody this idea of Kai's aunt, you know, this continuous improvement. Thirdly, to develop a gritty mindset, we need purpose. Now, imagine this scene, you see three brick layers and they are doing their thing laying bricks, and you ask them, hey guys, what are you doing? The first one says, I am laying bricks. The second says, I'm building a church, and the third says, I'm building the house of God. When the going gets tough, which of those three do you think is going to have the most grit, the most passionate perseverance, obviously is going to be the dude who's got a higher purpose behind the thing that he's doing. Angela's team surveyed 16,000 American adults to help figure out whether pleasure or purpose contributed more to their grit. They found that everyone, whatever the level of grit basically had the same pleasure in the stuff they were doing, but the people with higher grit had more purpose. So, if we can find a way to convince ourselves that what we're doing actually has some sort of higher purpose, then we'll be more gritty and Angela says there are three different ways that we can do this. Firstly, we can reflect on how the work we're already doing can make a positive contribution to society. Secondly, we can think about how in small, but meaningful ways we can change our current work to enhance its connection to our core values, and thirdly we can try to find inspiration in a purposeful role model. So, for me in this YouTube channel, for example, I'm sure at some point in the future, when I'm no longer driven by the pathological desire for fame and fortune, I'm sure at that point I'll be able to read this book and I'll be like, you know what, I need a higher purpose, and the higher purpose behind making these YouTube videos is to help people. But what underlies all three previous characteristics is the fourth key component and that is hope grit depends on a hope that rests on the expectation that our own efforts can improve over time so we can become better in the future. So, to develop grit, we need to forget about this idea that our abilities might be fixed and we can develop this idea that Carol Dweck called the growth mindset, which is something that I'm very bullish about. Angela says that while a fixed mindset leads to pessimistic explanations of adversity, a growth mindset leads to perseverance and seeking out new challenges that will ultimately make you stronger. And yeah, this is so important, like absolutely everything is a skill, absolutely everything can be learned and we can all improve in whatever we want, however we want and I think having that kind of attitude, like I've tried to develop that over the last, like you know, two decades of my life and I think it's really served me really well. So, overall, we can grow our grit from the inside by cultivating our interests, engaging in challenging practice, connecting our work to a wider purpose beyond just being rich in famous and learning to hope and cope with adversity by adopting a growth mindset. If you want to become a more gritty and successful person, you might like to check out this week's sponsor and that is Blinkist. Blinkist is a fantastic app that distills the world's best-selling non-fiction books into bite-sized summaries of the key ideas that you can listen to or read in 15 to 20 minutes. In fact, the Blinkist summary of grit was partly what I used to craft this very video. So, whenever you have a spare few minutes, you can hop onto the app and you can read and listen to sapiens or atomic habits or the four-hour workweek or even grit if that's what you want. The Blink's also crucially come in audio format. So, if you're like me and want to listen to stuff at double speed while you're in the car, you've got the option of doing that as well. And so, on a journey to work, I can listen to like 10 to 15 different non-fiction books. And then, like, I'm not just going to listen to them and forget about it. Then, I can decide based on that. Okay, which of these books do I actually want to read in their entirety? And that's like a really nice way of helping me filter down, you know, my long-ass list of, you know, books that I want to read into a more manageable short list of books that I'm actually going to read. If that sounds up your street, then head over to Blinkist.com slash Aliabdahl or take the link in the video description. That'll let you sign up to the free trial of Blinkist. And then, at the end of it, you can get 20% of the annual premium subscription. I personally pay for it. I think it's totally worth it. If you like this video, you should definitely check out my summary of atomic habits by James Clear, which is all about how to build good habits and break that one. That'll be linked in a little playlist over here. Just for your convenience. Thanks for watching and I'll see you next time. Bye-bye. I think this is really great, and there's Kaiser on Kaiser. Thirdly, we're talking if that sounds up your street, then click the link in the video. Let's try again.
