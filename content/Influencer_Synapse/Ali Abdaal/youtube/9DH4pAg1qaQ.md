## Transcript
 Hey friends, welcome back to the channel. So we have just hit the big two million subscribers huge thank you to everyone who's a subscriber of this channel. But with kind of these sorts of milestones I always kind of stop and take stock of like where we've come and where we're going and like how my life feels at these kind of milestones and I feel like a book like this ego is the enemy by Ryan Holiday is like a really helpful thing to revisit at these kind of milestones because it's very easy when you're like post on Instagram and it's like yeah two million everyone's like oh my god you're amazing like congratulations all that kind of stuff it's very easy to let success get to our heads maybe you've had this like where you've like accomplished a milestone or something and it's like you sort of get high off your own supply it's not really a good thing and so in this video I want to talk about I've been I've been rereading the summary of this book I first read this a few years ago it was really good but I've been rereading the summary of a shortfall thinking of the video description if you want to check it out and there's some lessons from the book that I'm finding it really helpful to revisit so let's just go over those. Now Ryan Holiday splits this book into three parts part one aspire part two success part three failure and that's a decent way of doing it the way I want to split this is sort of in terms of the lessons that I feel most applied to me because I can then I can then talk about them for a personal perspective and so we're going to split this into three parts number one pupil number two process and number three perseverance. All right so lesson number one under the pupil section is to embrace the beginner mindset and I think when I first started out with this YouTube channel and basically everything that I do I was I did a pretty good job of kind of seeing myself as a beginner because I wasn't beginner like 100% and I was then doing whatever a talk to kind of get better at the thing and to improve and to listen to a bunch of podcasts and other YouTube channels helping me to grow on YouTube to read a bunch of books all around kind of what makes good storytelling what makes good branding and all this stuff associated with being a YouTuber I think over time as we get success in any kind of field we can start to lose that touch with the beginner mindset. I still think I have it to an extent but I have to constantly remind myself to have more of a beginner mindset because now that we've got two minute subscribers and people come to me asking me for advice and how to grow their YouTube channels is very easy for me to start to feel like I have all the answers and check me out I know all the things but what I try my best to do is to kind of humble myself a little bit like anytime I speak to like Thomas Frank or Matt DeVelo or League of League all these other kind of friends of mine who have like ridiculously successful YouTube channels we've actually gotten there with less videos that I've made which shows that they're like doing something very very right I always try and think okay this is really cool how can I be a beginner here how can I learn from these people but also within my own part-time YouTuber Academy we've got a bunch of students who have started YouTube completely from scratch and their channels are doing really well and so I look at those channels and look at their videos and I try and think to myself okay what are some tips and ideas that I can steal from these guys' videos that we can apply to our channel just to try and really embrace this idea that we're always a beginner in whatever we're doing even as we get more success with that thing and there's a nice quote from the book where he says the pretense of knowledge is our most dangerous advice because it prevents us from getting any better and secondly related to the idea of the beginner's mindset is the idea that he talks about about being a lifelong learner and that's another way that we can combat ego and pride in all those kind of bad things and so again here this is all about like figuring out where the holes in our own abilities are so like for me the other day I realized that now that I've got a team of like 12 people and we're hiring another eight people every day almost I realized that there are holes in my ability to be a good manager and a good leader and so I actively seek out books and coaches and mentors and stuff to help with that side of things and again that's just one of those things that as you get success at at stuff it becomes easy to think that like oh I'm I'm I'm King I know what I'm doing but actually none of us knows what we're doing we're all making it up as we go along and therefore we can always improve secondly we have the idea of process now here the way I'm thinking of this is that like to combat the ego and pride and stuff we want to be focused on the process focused on the journey rather than the destination and so one of the points that Ryan Holiday talks about in the book is about how we should be keeping our ambitions internal there is a whole sphere of self-help advice that's all around positive visualization and this idea that you know the secret to the law of attraction that if you're really really really want something and you put to that intention out into the world then you will get the thing and there are a lot of a lot of self-help he type people who would say that you really want to visualize your goals and visualize success and like have very strong ambitions and kind of know what drives you and share it with the world but what Ryan Holiday talks about in the book and sort of lessons from stoicism is that like when you share your ambitions and your goals with other people there's a decent amount of evidence that that actually prevents you from achieving them in some context so like he tells the story of this like guy what was the name opt-in-synclair who wanted to be like mayor of New York or something I can't remember the exact story but he wanted to be the mayor of some town in America and he wrote this whole like manifesto this whole book talking about exactly what he was going to do when he became mayor in all of the different ways he cured poverty and all this kind of stuff and he wrote it in the past tense so he acted as if he had already achieved the thing now this is a pretty standard in the self-help world where you sort of act as if you are more successful than you actually are but this guy did this and then what he found is that his motivation to actually become mayor and do all these things when completely down the drain because when we talk about our goals and we talk about our ambitions it's sort of like our brain has decided that we've already done those things and so we have less of a drive for them and you might have had this I've certainly had it when if I've got a project in mind like I want to make a new course or I want to write this thing or I want to make a video about a certain topic in a way the more I think about it and the more I plan it out the less likely I am to actually do the thing because now I've done all I've done the fun bit of like strategizing and planning and I was just down to the execution and the execution is like oh I'll just do that later and I keep on putting things off and so for me what I'm trying to do is get this kind of balancing act between keeping my ambitions internal like I have goals I have things that I want to do sort of but I'm trying not to openly overly share them with other people because I know that that's probably bad but also when I do decide I want to go for a project I'm trying not to overly like positively visualize the context like for example you know we're in the process of hiring like 10 new people for the team more on that in a future video and potentially getting an in like a real life office space in London with studios and stuff and so I've been looking at people like MKBHD and Linus Tech Tips and what kind of amazing studios they've got I was kind of getting a high-of-one to apply the other day where I was like oh my god imagine how amazing the studio could be and then I read one of the one of the summary points from from the book and I thought okay no I need to stop thinking about that and actually one of the things that that they talk about on short form it's it's quite good because they got like a summary of the book but they also talk about like the nuances and the criticism of the book and one of the things they talk about is the idea of negative visualization like when it comes to positively visualizing stuff like achieving our goals further down the line that is apparently good if you like to help reduce our stress levels it can reduce our anxiety because we can imagine ourselves as being successful but in terms of actually getting stuff done negative visualization has a lot more evidence that it's actually successful so like imagining the worst case scenario and imagining how this might not work and so what I'm trying to do a little bit more of is imagining what would happen if the business failed if the YouTube channel failed if our courses stopped getting students if our content became irrelevant at that point what I do and what I'm hoping is that that negative visualization will make me more prepared if that actually does happen so it'll be less devastating but be hopefully a little lighter fire underneath me to kind of take the YouTube channel more seriously and to put more and more effort into it so that we can get to that point and avoid that negative visualization stage so a long and rambly way of saying that like one of the things that Ryan Holiday talks about in the book is to keep our goals and our ambitions to ourselves for the most part not be overly keen on visualizing success and thinking that we're the legends but actually taking a bit of a step back doing the stoicism thing of negative visualization potentially instead and hopefully that will help us more in the long run and help us to combat our own ego. When and before from the book is the idea that we should do something rather than be someone this is similar to some of the stuff that James Clay talks about in atomic habits and other very good book whereby you know the way that we approach goals can often be around like identity rather than around action so you know for me is like I want to be a successful YouTuber or I want to be a writer or I want to be a bestselling author these are all things that I want to be but that is kind of an ego driven way of approaching our goals and what Ryan is arguing here is that we should instead think about doing the thing doing the verb rather than being the noun so you know instead of I want to be a bestselling author instead the doing is I want to write a book that I'm really proud of that sells well and instead of I want to be a YouTuber it's the doing is I want to make two videos a week instead of I want to be an entrepreneur the doing is I am starting my business and so shifting from a being mindset more towards doing one is another way of combating our ego which of course is famously the enemy and key point number five and other thing that Ryan talks about is how we should basically keep our head down and do the work as we have combating the ego he talks a lot about like the idea of self-promotion and you know there is value in self-promotion once you have something to promote and certainly Ryan Holiday has got on famous off the back of a ton of self-promotion and done it really well like he's a professional marketer as well as a writer but there is okay I had the the privilege of having a phone call with him a few months ago asking for advice on the book that I'm writing and I said to him I was like Ryan may it like how how do I make this book become a best center and he was like okay dude that's the kind of the wrong way of pushing it you want to think about actually writing a really really good book first and I want to you've written a really freaking good book at that point you can start doing the self-promotiony marketing side of things but his advice was don't think about the marketing right now put your head down and actually just do the work and I was thinking about this because that was very much the way that I approached this YouTube channel in the early days I knew a few YouTubers who were quite big and I was like okay maybe I could do a collaboration with them but instead of kind of going straight for that what I thought initially for the first like nine months of the YouTube channel was okay I just need to put my head down and do the work and even to this date I haven't actually done that many collaborations you know especially kind of collaborations with bigger YouTubers and even now I still think the model is pretty head down do the work and the collaborations and the friendships and the network and stuff will ultimately follow from that whereas I know quite a few YouTubers who have started out and thinking and thought hey I need the fastest way to grow my channel why don't I try and get a collab with like a big famous YouTuber or whatever but they haven't done the work at that point and so you know putting your head down and doing the work is one way of combating the ego problem there's also also a more surefire way to success there's something that Matt DiVella famously says which I think is a really nice quote which is that be so good that you can ignore the algorithm and so that's sort of how I try and think about kind of the YouTube channel and the business says like how do we just get so good that we don't need to really worry about the promotion aspect of things we don't need to worry about the collaborations how do we put our head down and just do the work something I'm still kind of it's all this is all the working progress I'm kind of making this video as a way of giving advice to myself especially when it comes to growing the channel growing the business writing my book sometimes you just gotta merge the time you're gonna put your head down and actually do the work and not worry about all the other BS that comes with a marketing and self-emotion side of things so we've got number one pupil number two process another third pee is a persevere and the whole kind of third section of this book is about failure and our relationship with failure which is obviously an enlarged part related to this idea of ego and pride that we all have especially when we're successful at something that often like if you get success at something then that success can inevitably lead to failure because the perfectionism that we have through the success can hold us back from taking risks and doing more experimental things and potentially growing as people and there's like a chapter in here that I really like it's called the effort is enough and basically what he's saying here is that we want our barometer for success to be our own effort rather than the results of our effort and this is similar to my view around goals like having goals that are a hundred percent within our control rather than goals that are outside of our control for example the goal of writing a book that I'm proud of is within my control the goal of making two videos a week is within my control but the goal of the book hitting the New York Times best set a list or a video getting a certain number of views that's kind of outside of my control and so what he talks about is one way of being more okay with failure is to recognize and reward ourselves internally for the effort rather than the outcome he says John Kennedy tools great book a Confederacy of Dances was universally turned down by publishers news that news that so broke his heart he later committed suicide in his car on an empty road in Beloxy Mississippi after his death his mother discovered the book advocated on his behalf until it was published and it eventually won the Pulitzer Prize think about that for a second what changed between those submissions nothing the book was the same it was equally great when tool had it in manuscript form and it fought with editors about it as when it as it was when the book was published sold copies and won awards if only he could have realized this it would have saved him so much heartbreak he couldn't but from his painful example we can at least see how arbitrary many of the breaks in life are this is why we can't let externals determine whether something was worth it or not it's on us the world is after all indifferent to what we humans want if we persist in wanting in needing we are simply setting ourselves up for resentment or worse doing the work is enough it's really nice that's like a really nice like sort of every time I read that kind of section of the book it feels very like hot warming that yeah doing the work is enough that like doing the work and putting stuff out there is the thing that I should be basing my own kind of self self esteem off of rather than how it's received by other people and I think this idea of ego the idea of like oh you've hit a certain subscriber count oh this video made there's many videos oh you hit this much money in the bank account or whatever any of that kind of stuff these are all externals it's and there's those are all focused on the destination whereas I think you know following the advice of Brandon Simonson in the storm like archive journey before destination the more we can think about the journey about the process and the less we fixate on the destination the more likely we are to combat the ego thing at least that's what I'm trying to do and you know we're also going to be more likely to have a healthy happy fulfilled sort of life following the journey rather than the destination now if you want to learn more about this sort of stuff the ego is the enemy is based around the concept of stoicism which is the ancient Greek school of philosophy that a lot of people subscribe to Darren Brown's book happy is also based around the concept of stoicism you could read these books genuinely I'd recommend them they are very good but if you're not much of a fan of reading what you can said do is watch my online class all about stoicism which is hosted over at Skillshare who are very kindly sponsoring this video you probably heard by now Skillshare incredible platform with online classes from all
