With a couple of weeks left until my final shift at the hospital, I thought I'd document exactly what I do every morning before a typical shift at work...

## Transcript
 As a doctor who saves lives on the regular, my workdays starts at 8 a.m. and so I've optimized my morning routine to maximize productivity, efficiency and ultimately happiness. As dawn breaks and the clock chime 6.30 a.m., my iPhone alarm wakes me out of my dreams of a better future for the world. I immediately jump out of bed with boundless optimism in my eyes and take a few seconds to make the bed because, like a special upside-down, I believe in starting the day with discipline and integrity. I turn off my alarm, take off my hour ice-smart ring that measures the quality of my sleep, and have a cheeky chug of water from my bottle before heading straight into the bathroom. After stripping off my scrub bottoms, I step onto my Wi-Fi enabled smart scales that, hopefully, tell me how many pounds have put on overnight and whether my body fat percentage and muscle mass is moving me closer to my dream of becoming a gym shark athlete. With tears of failure streaming down my cheeks, I open up Spotify and play one of my playlists from medical school to relive the glory days. Next I cleanse my face of impurities with the masculine vitamin E, facial cleanser from the arches and on body shock, followed by an occasional session of shaving with the Phillips one blade. Then I step into the shower where I brush my teeth and empty my bladder at the same time because of course, to do any differently would be to sacrifice efficiency. My electric toothbrush tells me one of brushed for two minutes, after which I swallow the toothpaste and proceed to lather up and disinfect the rest of my body with whatever wasn't said at Asda, I consider myself a man of culture after all. I give myself three songs worth of time in the shower, after which I towel dry my hair and body, locuriating in the feel of the Egyptian cotton towels that I last washed some time in 2016. I walk back to the bedroom, look through the wider window to make sure there's no one watching me for the streets, and quickly don a pair of uniclo-arism boxes, the best underwear in the world. It's the summer, so I put on my blue shorts that I last washed in February 2018, and a t-shirt from my extensive collection. Like my friends Mark and Steve, I believe in minimizing optionality and decision fatigue in clothing choices. Next, I moisturize my face with the Natio Daily Moisturizer, including Sun Protection Factor 15, of course, and spray a few sprays of allure home by channel, recommended on one of my favorite YouTube channels, School of Sense. It's got a pleasant but natural and light scent, perfect for these hot summer days. At this point, I put on my Apple Watch Series 4, and on my junior doctor NHS Laniard but I wear to work, and also sometimes on my days off to keep myself motivated. The final act of my ultra-productive morning routine is, of course, to make my morning cup of coffee. I weigh out 15 grams of ground coffee that I get delivered from packed coffee each week, and boil the kettle to 91 degrees, which I check with a meat thermometer. It's my dream to one day own one of those fancy brewing kettle that have temperature controls built in, but that seems like an excessive indulgence at this point in my life. I follow the chemics brewing method from my internet colleague James Hoffman, and pour the resulting masterpiece into a travel cup that I take to work. During the three minutes of the coffee takes to brew, I have a token stab and doing some mindfulness and stuff because I've heard that's good for you. Once the coffee's done, I'm usually running late for work, so I grab my bag, stick my AirPods in my ears, begin listening to an audio book and audible at 2.5x speed, and run out of the building into my car. Assuming everything works as planned, I drive away from Cambridge at around 7am and arrive at the hospital around 750, ready for a full day of saving lives and stamping out disease. Thank you for watching.
