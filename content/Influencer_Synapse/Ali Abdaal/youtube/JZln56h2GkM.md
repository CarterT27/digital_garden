## Transcript
 Hey guys, welcome back to the vlog and to get another study with me video. Today we're going to be studying out in the sun in the beautiful garden of our university accommodation. So as usual we'll be doing time lapses of us doing work and I'll be hopefully explaining stuff as we go along. Maybe giving you some tips on how you can revise your own exams and hopefully just add a bit of variety to our lives. We're going to inject some like cinematic sequences of us making lunch and all that standard stuff. So yeah, hope you enjoyed today's study with me video. See you later. So we kick the day off by doing some role plays of how to explain DINACPR to the patient. DINACPR means do not as temporary solicitation and after discussion with the patient and their family we sign this order which means that if the patient's heart stops and if they die we don't attempt CPR to bring them back from the dead. This is an important conversation to be able to have could have caught pinnour exams so we ran that scenario a few times with each other. From around 11 o'clock we worked on assessing a patient's fitness for discharge. This is where note-taking comes in. As I alluded to in the previous study with me video I don't really mind making notes if there isn't an easily accessible summary already available and in this case there wasn't really. So these are the sorts of notes that I made and I think there are some good general tips from these. Firstly I think numbers are really important. A splitting up a topic into numbered lists is so much more useful than bullet points for explaining it to someone and even when we're thinking about it ourselves we can think right before main things in this topic are dotted with bullet points which is often the default that a lot of us go for and that certainly was the case for me back in the day. If you don't really get the satisfaction of being able to say that there are four points you need to know or there are five points you need to know for this. There was another thing we did here so we split up the activities of daily living that we had to talk about into eight different parts but it's normally quite hard to remember like a list of eight without any other aid memoirs. So what we did was we we've the story about how to remember these things and we thought about it as if an elderly patient is going about their day. So the first thing they do is they wake up and they walk to the toilet and then when the toilet they have a shower and change their clothes and then they try to walk downstairs and then they cook their food. All of this kind of stuff that's sort of a very simple story that lets us remember these eight point checklists. Through that this topic does lend itself very well to a story like this but to be honest you can try and apply this sort of story to a lot of things where you've got to learn a long list of stuff so I remember back when we were doing Jesus' geography we used to have the story of Percy the Pebble and Billy the Boulder and let how they'd be kind of like rolling down this river and introducing the concepts are the various different types of erosion as we went along. So having done a couple of role plays explaining DNACP or to one another and then having created the system for how to assess a patient's fitness for discharge we decided to have lunch and just to break things up here is some slow more of us making an eating lunch. While we were having lunch Jake and Paul came up to the kitchen and we talked them how to do this fitness for discharge assessment that we worked on in the morning. So I was the one that came up with a little story thing so instead Catherine was the one who explained it to Jake because then I could kind of oversee them and see if there were any holes in her knowledge and that was helping all three of us learn. And what Catherine did which was really good is that while she was explaining it to Jake she made him generate a lot of the things himself so instead of saying that okay well we've got this eight point list and first in the patient wakes up second they likely they go to the toilet thirdly they have breakfast. Instead of doing that she made him do like kind of work it out from first principles so she said right Jake what's the very first thing that you do when you wake up at the morning Jake said oh I have breakfast and then she said don't know the very first thing you do and then Jake said okay I'd get out of bed and she was like perfect that's point number one what's the second thing you do when you get up and he was like well I walked to the toilet and then she was like perfect so walking and to go into the toilet are points two and three on our checklist so get what I mean like when kind of explaining stuff to someone else it's better to get them to generate the answers by themselves if they can and you kind of prop them a long rather than just kind of spoon feeding them and good general point as well once you've learned something then try your very best to teach it to someone else it helps you because it helps you consolidate your knowledge and it helps the other person because you know you're teaching them something and you know this is this is collaborative rather than competitive and and all of that stuff after lunch we decided to run through some history taking role plays and then decided to do some palliative care stuff because firstly it's quite important for real life and secondly we thought it might come up in the exam so there were four of us in the room and we brainstormed four different areas of palliative care that we should probably know about and for about 15 minutes each of us picked one of the topics and we made our own kind of notes summary for it and then at the end of the 15 minutes we all explained our topics to each other so that we like essentially we crowd sourced all the knowledge we needed in about a quarter of the time because we'd split up the workload and that was really useful way of getting a lot of content into our brains very quickly so my topic was what happens in the final moments of life what does it look like when someone's dying I found some pretty good guidance on a hospice website and I turned that into a summary on notoriety my iPad app for taking notes of like an eight point checklist of what it looks like when someone I wrote this down in different colors firstly because it helps kind of separate you visually on the page and secondly because I like writing in different colors and it just you know makes the process of revising and making notes much more pleasant so why not do it and this is where the number of this thing comes in so it was far easier for for the others to remember an 8 point list of things to know when someone is dying then it was like if I just done it by bullet points and not given them like a clear idea of how many they had to know so after that the others went upstairs to practice some role plays and I decided to stain my room and watch some recommended videos of our director of studies showing us how to do a psychiatry risk assessment from someone who's attempted suicide this was a really good video and as I was watching I took some warnotes on my iPad of words and phrases that Dr. Wilkins was using and of the structure that he was using while he was kind of doing this risk assessment taking notes while watching a video or while watching a lecture is really important because a he helps keep me awake otherwise I've very easily fall asleep in lectures secondly because it acts as like a summary of things that I can look at at a later date rather than having to watch the whole video and it also kind of forces me to categorize and systemize things into my own system into my own structure and that acts as another cue for recalled that I can call upon at the late date. While I don't really endorse note taking as a revision strategy in itself I think it's really useful to do while kind of attending a lecture or watching a video. The by this point it's about 6.30 pm we've been working since around 10 a.m. and it's been pretty chill and we had a good time with friends but we've also got quite a lot done we post a message on a house facebook chat that we're doing some board games tonight and then people come to my room and we end the day with a solid game of articulate. So yeah that brings us to the end of another study with me video thank you very much for watching if you like the video please give it a thumbs up if you haven't subscribed to the channel please consider doing so have a lovely day good luck with your revision and I'll see you in the next video bye bye. oh my god that's no bagel it's not the north of Japan ocean it's not
