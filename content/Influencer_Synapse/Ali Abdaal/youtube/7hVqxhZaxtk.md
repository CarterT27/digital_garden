https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hVqxhZaxtk
In this video, I go over my annual expenses for 2021 in-depth across both personal and business. This is probably not that interesting for you honestly, but I always get comments from people asking how much I spend annually as I make videos about how I make money online, so I thought why not show you the other side of the coin. Enjoy xx

## Transcript
 Alright so honestly I'm not sure if this video is going to be useful to anyone but in this video I'm going to be talking about all of the money that I spent in 2021 both personally but also in terms of the business. I have done a video that you might have seen linked here and over there about how much money I made in 2021. The total figure on that is pretty ridiculous but that only tells part of the story really the expenditure is the other half of the story which is why we're making this video in the interest of transparency and honesty. If you don't care about my personal and business expenses don't watch the video on the state it's not going to give you any value to all I promise so please watch something else or do something better with your life but if you're interested for whatever reason maybe you have your own business maybe you're a creator and you're interested to see what these sorts of numbers look like or if you're just more morbidly curious maybe you'll find this video useful. Anyway let's start off with the personal expenses so we've got seven broad categories of stuff to talk about in the first one is rent and mortgage so currently I'm living in London I moved here around mid August and since then I've been paying around about $3,650 per month in terms of rent rent I'm actually paying pounds but I've translated all the money in GBP quick British pounds into dollars because dollars is a more internationally recognized currency that most people know what the dollar means whereas very few people know what a GBP means in their own local currency so sorry anyone from the UK if you're concerned why I'm talking about dollars so in addition to paying rent in London I'm still paying the mortgage on the flat that me and my brother jointly own in Cambridge when it comes to the mortgage I'm not counting the principal payment of the mortgage as an expense because it's just going into the home equity but when you have mortgage and our ours costs around about 1200 pounds per month which is however many dollars I don't know 1200 pounds per month off that 1200 a month about 200 pounds or 266 dollars is a ground rent and maintenance so this is the amount of money you just have to pay every month to just be part of the flat and that involves maintaining the elevators and the stairs and the stairwells and all that kind of stuff that is money that goes out of my pocket that is just money down the drain that I can never get back and there's also around about 531 dollars per month of interest on the mortgage it's got like a 1.6% interest rate something like that but the interest on the mortgage is also an unrecoverable expense and one of the things people often think about is renting is money down the drain but also when you buy a house and you buy a flat when a apartment and you have the ground rent and maintenance you have the property taxes if you're in the US you have the interest on the mortgage all of that is also money down the drain until the buy versus rent calculation is not quite as simple as renting is money down the drain but we'll talk more about that in a video another time and so in total I'm paying $14600 for these like four five months to live in London 9.5k in Cambridge and that gives us a total of $24,160 for the year which is $2,014 per month on average spent on rent plus maintaining this mortgage all right second big category expenses let's talk about food now this one's a bit mental so the first one is take away I spend about $40 a day 40 to 50 dollars a day on takeaway um which comes out to $1200 a month which comes out to $14,400 per year this is a bit mental the reason for this is that I tend to get takeaway for lunch and for dinner or if I'm here at the studio I tend to eat out for lunch and dinner or it even when I was in Cambridge and I was working from the local we work I would tend to eat out for lunch and dinner I kind of want to get more into cooking I saw sort of been saying that for many years now but I haven't really gotten into it partly the reason why I like takeaway so much is because it's just so incredibly convenient is being able to order takeaway on delivery and because I kind of feel like I'm doing a lot of stuff cooking is just a very low priority thinking my life cooking and cleaning up it all that stuff maybe 2022 news resolutions will be that I will make take more active effort in cooking but I do try my best to make those takeaways somewhat healthy so that I don't just completely balloon on average I also go to restaurants around twice a week and every time I spend around about $40 so that's $320 per month on restaurants which is $3,840 for the year but because I spend so much money on takeaway and restaurants I actually don't spend a lot of money on groceries maybe like ¬£50 or $70 a month on groceries which is only $840 per year which is a significantly lower grocery bill than most people in the world not in the world in the UK so there's that at least and if you're interested in what sort of takeaways I get it's mostly pookie balls from a place called Ahi Pookie which is very good and somewhat healthy or like grilled chicken from Pepe's or Nando's or something like that right so the third big category is the buying of stuff in general so tech is probably the best but the biggest expense here I actually don't buy a lot of stuff personally that I can't call a business expense but one of the things I recently bought was an Alienware gaming PC which was $4,600 and that was a personal expense I bought it to do some World of Warcraft and do some streaming and stuff and I ended up using it for a few months and then lending it to my friends because I never really used it ever again so that was a big tech expense this year that was pretty unnecessary if I'm being honest I also bought myself a massage gun one of those like ferrogun knockoffs for $130 to help my massage my shoulders and stuff because I've taken up massages and I bought a few Phillips Hue smart light bulbs to kick it out my flat and Cambridge and like one of them for London and all overall that added up to round about $400 spent on this sort of random bits and bobs of smart tech around the house so overall this year I've spent about $5,130 on random tech of which the bulk of that was that pointless Alienware gaming PC the next big category expenses is books and audiobooks now on average I buy about 15 books on Kindle every month this average is about $9 each been through my Amazon order history which is which means that I spent about $135 per month on books which is $1,620 per year I also have a subscription to audible and I often buy a bunch of audiobooks so for example I bought $167 worth of actual audiobooks this year and a bunch more from the 30 plus also Amazon like audible credits that I had this year as well now I spend large amounts of money on books in audiobooks because they are the single highest ROI return on investment thing that I could possibly spend my money on and my model for this is that literally any time anyone I respect gives me a book recommendation or any of my friends or anything like that then I would just immediately buy that book and stop reading it because like there are so many books that have just changed the way I think it changed my life in so many ways and it's just amazing that for somewhere between $5 and $10 you can get years if not decades of someone's research compiled into a book that you can read within a few hours or listen to within a few hours at 2x speed right so the third big category of buying stuff is clothes and on average once every three months I will do some kind of shopping trip and on average I'll spend somewhere between sort of 700 and 800 dollars on one of their shopping trips it's like you know these shirts you know I went through a phase of buying Ralph Lauren shirts which are kind of expensive I always seem to have to replace my underwear every few months it just disappears I don't know why I don't know if you guys have that as well the underwear just just vanishes I've no idea where it goes the underwear that I use if you're interested it is a unique low-airism it's by far the best boxes I've ever worn and they're great I also have to replace my socks every six months or so because socks also seem to vanish into the ether and I have no idea where they go but overall I spend about $2800 this year on clothing and then we have personal care so I subscribe to a product called Heights which is like the supplement thing for $53 a month I also invest in heights but I'm a paying customer it's a smart supplement I take two tablets every morning the other personal care subscription that I've got is this thing called Dermatica which is a retinoid skincare thingy which is about like $40 a month and then if we add up the other skincare personal care things like toothbrush toothpaste shampoo conditioner moisturizer sunscreen all that stuff overall that comes to about $78 per month and so it's $840 a year on toiletries $318 this year for heights because of only been doing it for about six months and that adds up to $1,150 spent on various personal care related things this year let's talk about home wear now so I moved into a furnished apartment in London so I actually didn't need to buy much in the way furniture which was quite convenient but for my Cambridge flat earlier this year I did buy the Dyson cordless animal the 10 Hoover something like that and that was about $700 I bought a Phillips air fryer and I used it once in my life that was about $200 and I bought a bunch of random like except like a dish trainer and and stuff of Amazon for like $20 here and there and so that's around $1200 spent on like kitchen or home appliances and then I spent another $800 on things like bed sheets and towels and linens and duvet covers and pillowcases which are surprisingly expensive I hadn't really needed to buy that stuff before because either it was provided by my university accommodation or by my mother but this year I decided to buy white company stuff and that was kind of expensive who knew this stuff actually cost money so $800 in total on that sort of bedroomy type stuff so overall around $2,000 spent on home wear and the final big category of buying stuff was that me and my brother bought our mom a car which was $16,000 each so $32,000 in total and we bought her that just fun because we were making money and we thought hey that's buying my mom a car so that was another category so in total the buying of stuff is a total of $28,955 which is around about $2.4K a month on average all right so the next big category of expenses is subscriptions and apps now in terms of dating apps I've spent $414 on dating apps this year so I had a hinged premium subscription for $234 a bumble life time subscription which I got last year so that doesn't count as this year's expensive expenses and I subscribed to Tinder gold for $20 a month and I used between January and September for $180 in total I also used a mouse match which is a Muslim dating app but I got a free premium subscription because I made to the guy who runs the company and I interviewed him on the podcast link down below if you want to check it out I'm not actually using dating apps anymore I will be making a video on that at some point in the future but overall $234 on dating apps then we have orderble which was $127 50 for the year honestly if I could only ever have one subscription in my life it would just be audible because I think it's just incredibly valuable and they're not even sponsoring this video I also slammed Amazon Prime which is $144 for the year Kindle unlimited which is $10 a month which is $127 in 20 cents per year what if I premium $131 a month $156 per year waking up by Sam Harris the app that I've been using to try and get into meditation that is $100 for the year Netflix I don't even have a Netflix subscription so I leech off of my brother for when I want to watch quit game or drive to survive is what I'm watching at the moment and in terms of my gym subscription I spent about $150 a month on the gym so I was a member of something called David Lloyd back when I was in Cambridge and now in London I'm a member of this thing called virgin active which you may have heard of but it at $150 a month so $111,800 for the year now this is the personal section so I've not included subscriptions for the business we subscribe to a zilly none of the things like zoom and notion but a hundred of other software apps but I'm software products but I'm not including those in the personal list next we have travel where this year in total I've only spent $3,330 I say only so quite a lot on travel added trip to Croatia which is around $800 trip to Amsterdam which is around $2,000 and a trip to Pakistan which was around $500 because I only played pay for the flights and everything else was like family and stuff next we have the big category of services and outsourcing so the big one on this is that I outsource my laundry which is around $50 per week so it's around $2400 for the year and obviously the reason I do this is because one of the best ways that you can use money to buy happiness is by eliminating the things that you find unpalatable I've freaking hate doing the laundry and I'm more than happy to pay some $50 a week to do the laundry for me and do the ironing and make sure the shirts are ironing all that kind of stuff and if that saves me two hours a time or even one hour of time I think it's an absolute no-brainer so outsourcing laundry has been a big quality of life improvement in my life this last year or so and yes I know this really privileged and first were problems and all that kind of stuff but hey if you have the money then you should probably outsource things that you don't like doing if you can afford it while I was in Cambridge we also paid for a cleaner to come in every other week and that was $34 every other week for about six months so four hundred and eight dollars in total for most of this year I've also had a personal trainer which is round about one hundred and ten dollars per week for somewhere between two and three sessions which is four forty a month or five thousand two hundred and eighty dollars per year in terms of personal trainer again I think this is a no-brainer expense if you can afford it yes I could go to the German stuff and go to classes and things if I really wanted to if I was super motivated but I found that since getting a personal trainer is a made working out much more fun and it's also made me more life you'd stick to it and more likely to actually push myself when I'm at the gym because I've got someone they're telling me what to do and you know people have been commenting for the last year or so that oh you look a bit bigger the biceps are looking good and that feel that feels nice so I think yeah in the future I'm just always going to have a personal trainer because it's a no-brainer if you again if you can afford it and if you value your health and if you're a waste man like me who can't self motivate themselves to actually do these exercises and finally I've spent about fifteen hundred dollars on various lessons this year in terms of art lessons which were around one thousand dollars in total for a few months and guitar lessons which were about five hundred dollars in total I've quit both of those guitar and art lessons because I ended physically not having enough time in my calendar to fit those in but maybe I will resume those at some point in life and finally just a blitz through the bills energy utilities gas electric water is roughly about a hundred and thirty dollars per month so 15 or so 15 hundred and sixty dollars per year car insurance is thirteen hundred dollars per year and the upkeep is zero because I have a Tesla that doesn't require any maintenance which is awesome and finally there's this thing in the UK called council tax which is around about one hundred and thirty dollars a month so that's about sixteen hundred dollars for the year and crucially I'm not including income tax as an expense I will be I will be taxed very heavily on my income but that will come later further down the line at the end of the financial year in the UK the financial year runs from April to April maybe it does elsewhere in the world I don't know and so income tax is not calculated as part of this year's like this calendar year's expenses at least in my book now on top of all these personal expenses I've also made a bunch of investments in things like real estate like the mortgage real estate upkeep stocks and shares and crypto a bunch of random altcoins which I've probably lost money on and a bunch of angel investments in various startups but I'm not including those in this video I will talk about my actual investment portfolio another time instead so overall my total personal expenses for the year are eighty nine thousand four hundred and sixty two dollars and the monthly average of seven thousand four hundred and fifty five dollars which is actually not bad it is lower than I thought it would be let's not go over all of our business expenses for this year so the data on this is actually much more on point because we have like accountants and bookkeepers and stuff when it comes to the business whereas on the personal side I did have to estimate quite a lot of stuff based on roughball blog numbers because I don't keep a detailed spreadsheet like I probably should in terms of budgeting on the personal side but we have exact numbers for the business so by far the biggest expense is salaries now this year we have spent five hundred and one thousand nine hundred and eighty seven dollars so far on salaries that number is going to be a lot bigger next year because for most of this year our team hasn't been that big our team was four people in January and then it went to six people in January and then we had seven eight around about June time but now we have seventeen full-time members of staff so yeah this salary bill is going to be absolutely huge now of this five hundred k about three hundred and fifteen thousand seven hundred and ninety five dollars is the team themselves and that's a monthly average of twenty six thousand three hundred and sixteen dollars now again this does not take into account the fact that we now have seventeen people because these are for this calendar year for that gives you an idea and it will be interesting to see what this number looks like next year as well we also spent one hundred and fifty thousand six hundred and twenty six dollars this year on contractors and freelancers so these are people who are helping out with marketing people who are helping up with social media branding we've outsourced an agency for some of our YouTube videos just to see what that's like all of this stuff all in all including our accountants actually are one hundred fifty thousand six hundred and twenty six dollars and we spent around thirty five thousand five hundred and sixty six dollars on consultants so this is kind of mostly around like YouTube analytics type consulting which has actually been quite a bit expensive overall five hundred and one thousand nine hundred and eighty seven dollars on salaries and wages this year the next big category is expenses that we have for our live online course the part-time YouTuber Academy part-time YouTuber Academy is by far the biggest source of revenue for the business it drives more than fifty percent of business revenue but it also costs one hundred and ninety seven thousand six hundred and seventeen dollars this year to run with a monthly average of more fourteen thousand three hundred eighty five dollars in fairness a bunch of these costs are around paying our affiliate providers because we've have it we've got affiliate relationships with various people and we have to pay them out quite a bit of money because they help get people to our course so it's not like we're losing money but we are paying a significant amount for affiliates we also pay for this service called my snapshot which is run by an internet friend of us called Charlotte Crowther and that is like an outsourced data visualization analytics team that helps with the data side of our course and we have a bunch of costs where we're paying people to be housemasters for the course so we at one point we pay big YouTubers to come in and help coach some of our students and we also pay for our student supporters and for our alumni mentors and staff to feed back to students and there's this whole like operation that goes behind it which I'll go into more detail in a later video. Alrighty next we have workspace so we have this studio which we moved into in October which is pretty expensive it was $14,600 per month for September through to December and that is $58,400 for the year and back when me and Angus were living in Cambridge we also had a subscription to we work which in total was $7,577 for the year and so so far this year we have spent what is it? $65,87 on workspace which I think has actually been overall very very very worth it and we have the studio which is stupid expensive in fairness for the next like 12 months so be interesting to see how the space evolves over time. Next we have food now weirdly in the business we actually spent about $1,000 a month on food and the main reason for that is that basically any time the team get together or any time we have a podcast guest or any time we're working with anyone or having a business meeting or anything of the sort we tend to order delivery for everyone and we pay for it through the business so we spent $12,000 this year on food which again I think has been worth it next we have equipment and supplies now we spend a bunch of money on stuff so for example on tech this year we have spent $69,980 and this bill was high then it should have been because at one point my Tesla got broken into and I lost someone stole about $25,000 worth of gear which I then had to replace so you know that was a bit of a bit of a hit to our bottom line because we had to replace all that stuff but also in terms of cameras you know Apple products we buy MacBooks for everyone in the business that adds up they just sort of adds up and so monthly on average we're spending $5,832 on various tech and camera related stuff and where do we also have those general category of expenses which has come out to be $50,272 for the year and that is like general stuff for the office that doesn't need to fall into any other category like I don't know gifts for team members like FedExing parcels if that's what we need to stationary buying various things for the office that kind of stuff. I don't need to take a closer look at this because I'm very curious as to how the hell we're spending $4,108 per month on like this general expense I think there is definitely stuff that we could we need to cut down on or at least figure out where that money is going. That's a bit weird. Next we have the broad category of subscriptions and software and on average each month we spent $4,146 on software oh my god I didn't know how that number was that big right well what's this coming that too so there's this app called workable which is what we use for like a hiring we paid $6,539 for that in total which is just in September when we were doing a big round of hiring that was quite expensive but was probably worth it. This year we've also paid $6,411 to convert kit which is the email marketing email software app that we use to send emails to people that's quite a lot. We've also paid $4,727 for the year to zoom. We have a zoom like premium account for a bunch of people to be able to run events for a thousand hundreds of people for a part of each of your academy that's quite expensive. We've paid $1,584 for the year for this app called grain which helps us record our zoom calls and transcribes it and that's kind of useful for the team. We've paid $2,722 for this service called aHRFs which is like a search engine optimization type thing that our marketing team uses to make stuff for the website. I'll pay a few thousand more to Adobe Creative Cloud for me and our editors and our videographer to be able to use the Adobe Creative Cloud which is kind of expensive. So overall this year we have spent $49,750 on various subscriptions and software on my days. Right three more categories to go and at number seven we have Coaching. Now I we spend a lot of money in Coaching. We've spent 74,644 dollars this year on Coaching that is business coaching of various kinds, coaching related to my book, coaching related to finance stuff, coaching related to operation stuff, coaching related to management, leadership. It's genuinely like really really really useful. I'm surprised that number is up higher. 74,644 dollars feels like a steal for the value we're getting from various coaches and that comes out to about $6,220 per month and yeah one of the things I want to do in 2022 is actually increase that number. So basically I want anyone in the team who has significant responsibility like any of our managers for managing team members to have a coach who's like talking them through the process and helping them out either on a weekly or on a bi-weekly basis and I think the ROI on that is just astronomical and so I'm very very bullish on the whole coaching thing. Next we've got business travel and this year we spent $18,540 on various traveling stuff. So that was mostly a trip to Monaco that we did to film a podcast with a chap called Oliver Cookson who wrote a book called Boost Dracula Life. He's the founder of a company called My Protein. And he turned it from 500 pounds to 350 million pounds. So we had him on the deal on the deep dive podcast link below if you want to check it out. That was a pretty expensive trip because we took me, we took a videographer and we took Amber and we took Angus so there was a lot of people on this trip and then it just adds up when we travel to various filming locations. I don't know where this money goes. I don't know how it just gets added up but like you know if we need to transport camera equipment or like go somewhere we'll get Uber's. We get we get taxi services for our guests to come to the studio for the podcast. It all just seems to add up and so we spend $1,545 per month on business related travel. And then finally another big category of expenses is taxes and fees. And so this calendar year that's come to $195,941. Now this does not include corporation tax which is going to be absolutely huge and we find it what that bill is but it does include PayPal fees which are 16,434 pounds. It includes employers rather of employers liability tax, employers tax and like various VAT value added tax type things. I honestly I don't know the 40 details of this. We're going to have a meeting with our accountants at some point before the end of the financial year which is in April and also in June for our company. So we haven't added up all these numbers full on because we don't work January through to December but at some point I'll have a meeting with our accountant where they're where they explain how much of our money is going on tax and just how insane our corporation tax bill is going to be for this year but hey it's fine we're making money we're having fun and we want to pay our fair share of stuff. So yeah $195,941 on fees and taxes excluding corporation tax which is going to be big and so if we add this all of this stuff up our total business expenses are $1.5 million $1,513,314 with a monthly average of $126,110. So $1.5 million in business expenses for the year I honestly don't know how the number got that high but it's going to be a lot higher next year as well now that like we're really kind of ramping up with the monthly expenses of the studio and all of the team members that we've got I just kind of hope that our revenue matches this and we can continue to have fun and enjoy the journey and hopefully help people while making a business that is just about profitable. If you're interested and you haven't seen the video on how much money we actually made in 2021 you should check that video out over there otherwise thank you for watching if you got this far I hope you enjoyed the video for whatever it was worth not sure what value you got from it but maybe you enjoyed it anyway thanks for watching leave a subscribe button if you aren't already and I'll see you in the next video bye bye
