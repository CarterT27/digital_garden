## Transcript
 Hey guys, welcome back to the channel and to medical Mondays, the weekly series where we talk about really really niche medical topics If you're new here, my name is Ali and I'm a junior doctor working in Cambridge and today We're talking about the academic foundation program the AFP specifically how to prepare for the critical appraisal component of the AFP Now, I say this all the time for this mini series This is really niche. It's aimed exclusively at fifth and six the medical students in the UK So if you're not in that category of people you probably won't find this very helpful It's basically me and my friend Mr. Anchor Kajuria who's a surgeon who's written books about the AFP and you know Runs of course for the AFP. We're basically talking in with a lot of jargon and stuff about how to prepare for this Station of the interview where you're being asked to critically appraise a paper So if this is relevant for you then hopefully you'll find this useful if not then you might find it entertaining anyway So yeah, we're gonna cut to me and anchor from six months ago where we're talking about how to prepare for the critical appraisal bit of the AFP interview Enjoy You So I'll give you an example for example in Oxford They commonly like to ask tell us about a paper you've read recently Oh, okay The tricky one now if you haven't read a paper recently here at one of the most prestigious academic Institutions in the UK that does not come across well, okay now when I went to my interview Or my friends went to their interviews they had spoken with people who had done the Oxford interview before And they had prepared not just one but two papers and You know, it's it's essentially a critical appraisal that you're doing of those papers But it's much nicer in a way because you've almost prepared it beforehand So you're not getting a paper or an abstract to read beforehand like you do for example in London But you already read this paper you can talk about the biases you can talk about The strengths and weaknesses of the paper and you know whether it would Subsequent in for me or perhaps as Okay, so in some so yeah as as I've said in the in some places You have to talk about papers you've already read an advance in London and in if you're the places They give you the abstract on the day and then you have to be able to critically appraise the abstract And in mind to be in the feedback we got afterwards it was the critical appraisal station that I really fell down on I did all right in the clinical emergencies because I you know memorized the Oxford handbook Whereas I didn't really know what to do for critical appraisal and that's what I really wish I discovered this book Can you tell us how how how does one go about preparing for this critical appraisal sure? So critical appraisal is all about practice So especially people applying a lot of people applying for the FPM have done a little bit of research But may not necessarily have had the critical appraisal skills Talk to them firstly and even if they did it would just be in passing You know as a sort of module of a particular course Yeah, we did well like well like one of their trend stats that yeah, he I see or something and like no one cares about it exactly Yeah, so you know, most people don't really have their experience and The key to getting comfortable with this stuff is just to read lots and lots of abstracts So for me, I use to Look at the new in the journal Abstracts they used to have Lot of randomized trials so rather much control trial is probably what you're going to get In your in your critical appraisal setting London. Yeah, that's on trend You can get sort of cohort studies and some weird and wonderful things But generally is going to be a randomized control trial that you're going to be asked to critical appraisal And actually the more you practice before the interview the more comfortable you'll be in the exam Sorry in the interview And There was a way to Sort of go about critical appraising. Everyone has their own way. I've I've Sort of developed my own and a way of doing it which I feel comfortable with which again. I've documented in here And you're more than welcome to follow that approach or you can develop one of your own approaches Which ever way is more comfortable But you need to cover some key areas which okay. I'm happy to go through it. Yeah, what are the areas? Bye So you need to be able to quickly summarize the paper firstly or the abstract that you've been given so Speak an example. So you can say something like this is a double blind Multi-central randomized control trial comparing drug x to drug y The primary endpoint was x the secondary endpoint was this the primary safety outcome was this Overall the paper shows this and and in terms of generalizability Something like that very quick and then you can take one or two directions there So once you've kind of presented your summary you depends how confident you are you can carry on talking Or you can wait for the examiner to then lead the conversation Sentry up to you but As you mentioned the peak of framework is a really nice way to Find out what the research question is so you know patient population What the intervention is the comparator and the outcome and Then Generally you need to talk about biases so things like selection bias and how you can address this biases with randomization Allocation concealment and lots of other things which I won't bought what boy you with But it's all in textbooks and As I mentioned in here And Once you've talked about biases then you need to talk about Two key aspects really internal and external validity, okay Internal validity is essentially More relates to the biases where is the external validity is about Generalizability so whether this study the results from this study can be applicable to your own Patient population so and they commonly will ask you this question so you've read the paper You've presented the abstract and then they will say do you think this will change your practice So imagine you're a consultant in 15 years time Do you think you'll start using this treatment? How do you approach that? But yeah, how do I approach that I would I would look at I would look at the abstract I would see what their patient group was okay and see whether it matches matches on with my patient group For example if I'm a consultant in the UK and this OCT was done in Vietnam If you know in mind not be applicable sure so I'd be looking at the patient group I'd be looking to see what two things were compared yep in that are we comparing existing treatment Again something new or you know two things that I won't be using anyway Anything else So the key to critical appraisal is to say that one paper is not going to change your practice That's never the case unless it's a groundbreaking You know Paper that's going to revolutionize things Generally in current literature one paper is not going to change your practice You need to look at what else is out there maybe think about doing a systematic review To re-inform your clinical practice and to see whether there are any gaps in the data that will lead to more research And and you can say that and you can look at the patient population your patient population groups whether they're similar to your Patient population and But generally I would avoid saying yes, I would change my practice On this one paper yeah, and I know just so that this doesn't completely seems like a sales page I'll put apart from your book, which you guys should get. Can you recommend any other resources that might help for this critical The praise of thing sure so for critical praise all there is Lot of stuff from Cochrane Yeah, yeah, well the Cochrane collaboration based on based out on Oxford Which I'm kind of Working where oh, that's a moment Check it out But they've developed some checklists that you can use the only problem with checklists are you can come across quite formulaic in the interview So you want critical praise all to come quite naturally in terms of Working through the abstract and It should kind of just flow rather than saying this is a randomized controlled Yeah, you know bias wise take okay, you know you don't want to come across like that Okay, and you'll tell the examiner the your literary following a checklist Which is not the way to go and I guess that just comes from practice that doesn't it like all right There's more you do it the more example you see more doing exactly and just if you're another plugin there There's a book called Hattery to Paper, which was recommended on this other if people said it went on and I read it Covered to cover it's a really enjoyable and engaging read and green I can't remember. I believe we download the P.A. I legally downloaded the P But yeah, I would recommend it. It's good. It's fun to read So that brings us to the end of this Critical appraisal thing Okay, so that was how you prepare for the critical appraisal bit of the AFP interview as usual I'll leave links to all of the stuff we talked about in the video description including anchors book and it's course The book's pretty good. I didn't go on the course myself, but I've heard it's good So yeah, hopefully you liked this video and gained something from it in the next video Which is gonna be the final video in this many series about the AFP We're gonna be talking about how to prepare for the personal interview because Like when I interviewed at EPH that was an exclusively personal interview that was nothing fancy Academically about it and lots of other places have a personal interview So hopefully that'll be useful and we also talk about other resources that you might find helpful So if you like that you can check out the next video the whole series will be linked in the video description But yeah, thank you for watching if you liked the video please give it a thumbs up If you haven't subscribed to the channel please consider doing so I make videos about life of a junior doctor these days and about tech staff and You know stuff like that. See you might find that vaguely interesting So thank you for watching and I'll see you in the next video. Bye bye
