# Payphone (Maroon 5) - Katherine Macfarland & Ali Abdaal acoustic cover
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7APfFjfnNBc
First cover of 2017! We both love this song, so we thought we'd give it a go and see what happens. 

Made a few mistakes, but we think it's funnier that way, and we didn't want to spend more hours trying to get a better take :/ 

Enjoy xx
