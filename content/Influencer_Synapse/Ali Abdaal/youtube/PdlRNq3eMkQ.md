## Transcript
 Wanna guys, welcome back to the channel. Today is the day of the SJT, the situational judgment test, which is the exam that pretty much determines where we're going to end up for our foundation Junior Doctor Jobs next year. So now for the long cycle into Cambridge Town Center in the cold, slow conditions to set the exam. See you in a bit. A few moments later. All right, so that's the exam over. Everyone's mending around the field hall. We're all discussing what's been going on over there. It was just a good delightful experience. I'm always doing it again to you. Thought. I'm not a thought. I just used all the money there. So pretty much how big is the exam with medical school careers over. So we're pretty psyched and we're heading to pizza Express to pizza Express and what pizza to celebrate. All right, time for the pizza hunt buffet and celebration of finishing our salad. Let's see if we can see you in a bit. What you're going to do is you're going to memorise the order of this deck of cuts. And it's going to be wonderful. I'm going to take a card from the bottom and a card from the top. I want you to tell me which of these is bread and which of these is black. What about the next one? What about red? Okay, and the next one. Uh, red. And also black. Okay. Uh, red. Right. Right. In fact, why do you like the cards yourself? And one at a time, face down. Just like dealing with a red and black. Nothing too hard about it. The focus in your subconscious mind is one at a time, face down. Yeah. Remember? Great home, back again. Yeah. What would you say other chances of her? Because, okay, got that one. Is that one? Got that. But now I can go down. Now I can go down. Got that. Got that. Got that. I can go forever. But really, perfect separation. Red cards on one side. Black cards on the other side. I'm really going to hate it. You're a magician. What is this? Bravo. Hey guys, so today seems to be Pizza Day. Pizza Day, that's what it is. Pizza Day, you're going to love it. So, uh, after the, after the cheeky SJT, uh, we went to Pizza Hut for the buffet there. You went to Pizza Hut already? Yes, you've been a master. Uh, and now Calam is very kindly making pizza for all of us. Her made pizza. So, we're going to do a cheeky, uh, cinematic, slow-mo, montage thing of Calam making pizza. So, to be appropriate, uh, music track, uh, hope you enjoy it. And then we can go afterwards. We're going to make some four things. Yeah, can't be bothers with any more work today. Here we go for the Pizza Montage. Alright guys, so now is the end of the day. We've had a wonderful day. We had the SJT in the morning. Then we went to Pizza Hut for a buffet. Then we just kind of chilled around Cambridge, uh, went to the winter fair.
