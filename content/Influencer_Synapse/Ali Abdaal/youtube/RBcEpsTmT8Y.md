## Transcript
 Hey friends, welcome back to the channel. Let's talk about imposter syndrome. Now, this is something that I have been struggling with for many, many years. With this YouTube channel or my blog or my career as a doctor, basically with everything that I've done, I've always had a sense of how, you know, how am I the person to be doing this? Why am I the person to be doing this? Why are people taking me seriously? Like, all of these thoughts associated around this idea of that. Maybe I just kind of got lucky and I fluked into the position of being where I am. And oh my god, now there's attention on me and like what the hell do I do with it. And I think over time, I've gotten better at dealing with this imposter syndrome. I still get it all the time, but in this video, I want to talk through three stories in my life, where I really experienced imposter syndrome and lessons that I learned from it, which I've now taken forward and I'm trying to apply to my life today. The first one is fairly recent and that was in November of last year when I was running my online course, the part-time YouTuber Academy. And initially, this was supposed to be for like five or ten people where I was going to teach people kind of my systems and processes for being a part-time YouTuber. But in the first cohort, we ended up with around 350 people who were all paying like decent sums of money to hear me speak and teach them about how to be a YouTuber. Now, I had so much imposter syndrome going into this because like the feeling in my mind was how am I the one to talk about this? I've only got one point something million subscribers. Surely people should be listening to David Dobrik or Mr. Beast has got 50 million subscribers like why am I the one that people are coming to for this sort of information. And I think a lot of it came because I thought that I had nothing really to teach because all of the systems and stuff that I've built around my YouTube channel with my team. I just kind of got that off the internet and other channels like video creators and think media and like listening to loads of podcasts. And I felt like there was nothing new or interesting and it was all kind of just obvious stuff. It was all stuff that if you spent a long time doing YouTube, you would just I felt naturally pick up over time. But as I was giving the lessons over like a live live zoom course to our cohort of a few hundred students at a time like the chat was absolutely exploding with like people saying oh my god this is actually groundbreaking information. And this is something I always get when I I think we all have this when when we teach something or when we explain something. If we're teaching something it's kind of obvious to us and we don't appreciate that what's obvious to us can be amazing to others. And I read this in a Derek Sivers blog post a few years ago and I often return to it. It's it's this idea of the curse of knowledge. Like once we know something we think it's no longer interesting and we think surely it's obvious that everyone must know that thing. And so for me you know we have all these systems around around this YouTube channel like batching and parallel processing and sort of systematically structuring stuff. And I wasn't born being able to do that kind of stuff. I just internalized it over three and a half years of making YouTube videos and reading a ton of productivity books and business books and you know startup books and applying all these systems and stuff to my YouTube channel which I kind of treat as a startup slash business. And so in my head it was like all these things are obvious. Surely everyone knows that I'm surely there's nothing new here. But actually when I was explaining them this was blowing people's minds. And so it was a real illustration that what's obvious to you can be amazing to others. And this is one of the main issues people have when it comes to starting a YouTube channel or starting a blog or starting a podcast or putting yourself out there in any way. It's that we don't feel like our own ideas are worth anything because there are ideas and we've we've come across them somewhere and now they feel really obvious to us. And so that's one thing that I keep on trying to remind myself of anytime I get this imposter syndrome springing up that what's obvious to me what's obvious to us can be amazing to others. A story number two happened a few years ago in 2017 when I was in my fifth year of medical school at Cambridge and I was one of the two directors of the hospital pantomime every year the medical school puts on a pantomime which involves about a hundred people musicians and cast members and singers and like set designers and artists coming together to make this like comedy production. Now I had absolutely no experience of doing any of this sort of acting theater type stuff. It's just an area of life that I'd basically never ever done before and will who was the other director had loads of experience about this like he'd been doing theater for like a decade at this point and he was really good at acting and really good singing and new what being a director actually meant and he messaged me on Facebook one day being like hey he's gonna sound random but do you want to be the director alongside me? And I was like sure this sounds like it would be fun but then getting into the rehearsals and actually starting to do it I really had a massive sense of imposter syndrome because there was there was me with like zero experience alongside this guy who had like ten plus years of experience and he was fantastic and I thought I had no idea what I was doing and I would feel really self-conscious during the warm-up exercises like you know we'd get people to do silly things and to sort of warm-up and be like ook alaya and then like do like a way like pose and run around and you know just warming up the actors and the singers and you know it was it was down to the directors to lead the warm-ups and I remember I was I was doing this in my head thinking oh my god like no one's gonna follow me like they all know that I'm a fraud but I was doing the thing and people were well we're following the warm-up and it was it was like a magical feeling because I was like what what what the hell like surely everyone knows that I'm a complete fraud compared to where he's an absolute legend surely everyone knows I'm a fraud like why the hell are they following me and then even when it came to for example giving the actors feedback on their lines or tweaking things or even you know giving giving some feedback to the singers every time I would say it and was you know my heart would be thudding because I'd be like oh why is anyone gonna listen to me they all know that I have zero experience and this kind of thing but the weird thing is no one knew that I had zero experience and this sort of thing like this is a perfect illustration of the spotlight effect which is this kind of psychological phenomenon where we all walk around life thinking of there is a spotlight trained on us and that other people are looking at us and judging us and like you know any faux pas any mistake that we make other people are gonna see and they're gonna judge and after a few weeks of having this anxiety about leading warm-ups or about giving people feedback I realized that actually everyone is just worried about themselves like the cast or worried that they're gonna mess up their own lines the singles are worried that they're not good enough the chorus are worried they haven't got the dance moves the dance group are trying to get the dance moves properly like everyone was super concerned about their own performance and actively wanted feedback to be the best that they could and no one was thinking about me like it wasn't about me it was it was it was about kind of the the production as a whole and trying to get the best out of everyone and I realized that I was falling victim to the spotlight effect thinking oh my god these people are judging me but really they weren't they were just concerned about themselves and so what I found helpful there was to try and get out of my own head trying to appreciate that look mate no one is judging you everyone is just you know worried about their own performance so you do your job and they'll do theirs and in a way dissociating myself and my sort of my my sense of self from the role meant that I could step into the role of being the director and this is something that we have to do as as doctors as well like often if you're let's say you're a very junior doctor and you're maybe one week into into working and you know patients are treating you as as if you were the doctor and inside you know I would always feel like but you know I graduate from med school like last week I know I know absolutely nothing but in that position you have to step into the role of the doctor the patient isn't thinking about you or judging you as as an individual they're thinking about themselves and they want you to do your job as the doctor and I would always have to remind myself of this that you know no one knows that I'm just a week out of med school and I know what I'm doing more or less and I can ask a help one I don't when I don't know what I'm doing therefore this isn't about me keeping this spotlight effect into account and I found that that is another thing that's really helped me deal with in post to syndrome that I get around these sorts of scenarios and so overcoming in post to syndrome is this constant challenge of separating ourselves from the role that we're playing and separating our feelings from what's actually going on and recognizing that actually I'll fundamentally no one cares about us people are just worried about themselves which I think is extremely liberating and you know what else is liberating doing online courses over brilliant who are very kindly sponsoring this video if you haven't heard by now brilliant is a fantastic platform for online courses and maths science and computer science and they're all interactive and engaging and fun and they teach you the principles of these subjects in a very kind of first principle fashion which is similar to the style of teaching at Oxford and Cambridge where you have a small group of people you learn a little bit about something and then you get thrown into exercises that engage your mind and make you have fun and you get feedback on it and it's like a really fantastic way to learn I've been using brilliant for over a year now and I've gone through lots of their courses on maths and computer science in particular the one I'm taking right now is all about cryptocurrencies and about how cryptographic signatures work and how you know currencies like Bitcoin even exist and if you're interested in learning how to code they also have really good courses on Python which is the world's most popular programming language if any of that sounds up your street and head over to brilliant.org for slash alley and the first 200 people to hit that link which is also in the video description we'll get 20% off the annual premium subscription the final story from my life about overcoming imposter syndrome is something that I'm actually going through right now and it's it's I'm feeling it very strongly with the book that I'm in the process of writing so a few months ago I got approached by an editor from Penguin UK who said hey are you interested in writing a book about productivity and initially I was like absolutely not because I didn't think that I had anything useful to say about productivity I feel like I've already said it in video videos and I don't really have any original ideas all I'm doing is you know parenting ideas that Tim Ferris or David Allen and for our workweek or in getting things done these other people have already come up with the ideas and all I'm doing is just you know making videos about them and other than that one of the things I'm still struggling with is you know this question of what's the point of productivity like I've been chasing productivity and efficiency and passive income financial independence for the last eight years and now that I've kind of hit that point I've ticked I've ticked that box where I don't need to work and sort of work is optional and I've taken a break from Edison now I've got this sense of what the hell am I doing with my life and what's the point of continuing to try and be productive to you know you know do I just make more YouTube videos to make more courses to try and make more money like what's the point of it all and I realize that this is actually one of the angles I want to explore in the book it's like I think there are plenty of books out there and I've done plenty of videos about how to get more done but the thing that I'm that I actually want to know is how do we figure out what we want to get done and how do we figure out what's meaningful to us and what our purpose is and you know all of that stuff that in the past I used to think was a bit woo and so I was talking to my writing coach about this who's sort of helping me along with this process of writing the book and I was saying that like why the hell would anyone listen to me as a 26 year old you know random dude who makes videos on the internet about how to find what's meaningful and how to find what's purposeful and how to figure out what your values and vision are and even you know how to be more productive and the advice that my writing coach gave which I think about basically every day is that you don't have to be a guru you can be a guide now what's the difference between the two so a guru is someone who comes down from the top of the mountain and says look look at me I'm the expert I have all the answers whereas a guide is someone who is on the same journey as you and a guide says hey I don't have the answers but we're on the same path why don't we kind of approach it together and I'll show you what I've discovered so far and I found that that framing of it like guide rather than guru has really helped me overcome some of my imposter syndrome associated with writing the book because the way I'm approaching it it's not that look at me I'm the expert about all things productivity I'm the expert on how to figure out what to do with your life it's more a case of I don't really know what I'm doing in my life but I've got the chance to write this book about productivity and I've read lots of books about productivity and so why don't we explore together you me me and the reader like what what other people have written on the topic and what studies have been done about meaning and purpose and you know how productivity fits into this idea of figuring out what to do with our lives and then figuring out how we can do it efficiently and the more I think about it the more I see this guru versus guide thing play out in another aspect of life as well like basically everyone in my part time youtuber academy who's struggling with getting the youtube channel off the ground of growing the youtube channel suffers from this the same imposter syndrome of well I'm not an expert about the thing therefore I'm not allowed to teach people about the thing but the key thing that I always have to remind myself of is that you don't need to be an expert like I don't have to pretend to be a guru I can just be a guide and I can help people you know explore you know and go on the same journey that I've been going on and actually recently I've been reading loads of scientific papers and stuff and books about meaning values vision purpose and it's all really interesting stuff and it's all helping me kind of figure out what I want to do with my life and that's the journey that I hopefully want to take the readers on as well if you're interested in keeping up to date with my book writing journey then I have a special email list where I send out updates like every few weeks and ask questions and you know I'll send like drafts of chapters and stuff to that mailing list as well so feel free to join it that's linked in the video description and if you've gotten to the end of this video I would love it if you can leave a mask emoji you know that drama mask emoji if you can put that mask emoji in the comments because I'm always curious about who watches to the end of these long rambly videos I'm always like I always have the I always have importers syndrome about this it's like why would anyone watch to the end of like a 20 minute video like you know surely no one wants to hear me talk for that long and on the YouTube analytics it shows that most people only watch like 30% of a video so it's always nice seeing emojis in the comments where it's like it feels like real people have actually watched through to the end and if you want to leave a comment about anything that you've thought about in this video or anything is reminded you're of or any ways in which you've been overcoming importers syndrome that would be really nice to hear as well and if for example you're thinking of starting a YouTube channel or starting a blog or putting yourself out there in some way and imposter syndrome has been holding you back you might like to check out this video which is my 10 top tips for beginner YouTubers which also applies to other creative things that you might want to get started thank you so much for watching and I'll see you in the next video bye bye
