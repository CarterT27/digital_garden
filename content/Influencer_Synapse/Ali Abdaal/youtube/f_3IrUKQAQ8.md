## Transcript
 Hello everyone, welcome back to the BMAT tips series. My name is Ali, I'm a 50 medical student and today We're going to be chatting about chemistry calculations. This is sort of a follow-up to the last video about the approach Dissection to chemistry. So if you haven't seen that yet, I'd suggest you do because that talks about the fundamentals of section to chemistry This video is going to focus specifically on the calculation question. The calculation questions are quite tricky They're not tricky because they're hard. It is just GCSE standard after all, and if we had enough time We'd all be able to get a hundred percent. They're tricky because of the timing. You have to work out what the question is asking Remember the formula plug numbers into it and do rapid mental nuts in under one minute. This is quite hard So how do we prepare for these questions? There are three things we need to do firstly We need to know the formula for everything they could possibly ask us like the back of our hand For example, if we see a question about percentage yield we don't want to waste ten seconds of our lives thinking Hmm, what was the formula for percentage yield? We want to just have it at our fingertips and just be able to plug numbers straight into it Tagantly and this may seem a bit weird in relation to what I've just said But we need to be less reliant on the formula doing molar calculations. Most students that we help with A level chemistry struggle with the concept of moles and their way around this is to just memorize that triangle formula thing and just hope that they can plug numbers into it That works perfectly fine when you've got plenty of time in a GCSE or A level exam But when you've only got one minute per question in the beam at we ideally don't want to be wasting all that time thinking about the formula Thinking about which way around the MR the end of whatever it was and then having to plug numbers into it We ideally want to understand it in a more conceptual intuitive way. For example, let's say we need to convert 36 grams of carbon into moles There are two sort of ways that students might do this one student. Let's call him Ron. Would you use the formula triangle thinking? All right, so it's number in our last And we remember that Okay, so any first exams in the MR as well. So oh, yes, and number of all equals mass around Those six over 12's three right three moles sorted by us another student. Let's call it a Hermione Would know that the MR of carbon is 12 and would just be able to appreciate intuitively that therefore 36 grams of carbon is going to be three moles Of course Both students are doing exactly the same calculation in their heads But Ron is thinking about it in terms of a formula triangle that he could very well get confused by in the heat of the exam Whereas Hermione is thinking about it more intuitively She understands the concept of a mole and therefore doesn't need to remember a formula in order to convert grams to moles She just kind of does it without thinking Hermione will save pressure seconds each time she does one of these calculations Which over the course of this section two paper would add up to quite a bit of time when she might be spending getting another question right if This is confusing then don't worry. I've linked in the description to the free tutorial on bmanger that explains the concept of moles in a way that we wished We'd had to explain to us when we were doing the subject. Fact our whole chemistry calculations tutorial series is completely free on bmanger Calculations are probably the hardest part of beam at chemistry and although the official guide does have some guides on them Students from the past have found our explanations to be quite helpful in addition to the explanations of the guide So you might want to check those out right where are we? Oh, yeah, we were talking about the three things that you need to do to improve your performance in the chemistry calculation questions We talked about knowing the formulae inside out and then we talked about how you shouldn't overly rely on the formula for molar calculations The third thing we need to get good out was section two chemistry is mental maths And I'm gonna be talking a whole lot more about that in the approach to section two maths video Which is coming up for now a few things that are relevant to chemistry So beam at chemistry questions that involves numbers are a bit weird at first glance the numbers can look really scary And students think that you can either type later of all need to estimate very heavily to get the answer However the examiners are kind to us the numbers they give us in beam at chemistry are almost always quite friendly By friendly, I mean we can work with them in our heads for example They might give us something with an MR of a 137 and then ask us to do something that requires converting 2.74 grams into moles At first glance, this seems quite scary but with a bit of number fluency We might notice that one three seven is exactly half of two seven four Therefore we can use a bit of mental maths trickery We can think that if we had 274 grams with an MR of 137 that would be two moles But because we have 2.74 grams that's zero point zero two moles or two over a hundred or one over fifty If you like thinking about things in fractions like we recommend you should you'll notice how we didn't use any formula in that We just knew that 274 grams was gonna be two moles if I were using the formula in the heat of the exam And I had the numbers 2.74 over 137 written down But feel very scared indeed, so I'd want to avoid thinking about that at all cost But hey do whatever floats your boat sometimes we do have to fall back on the formula Especially as the numbers are as simple as 12 grams of carbon or 16 grams of oxygen Anyway, the moral of the story is that in beam at chemistry calculation questions You're gonna be getting numbers that you don't really have to estimate heavily with There'll be numbers that grow into each other in some simple way or another if you are having to estimate a lot for a particular question You might want to quickly double check just to make sure you've got the numbers right But if it's still taking too long been just ignore the question Guess an answer and move on it's not worth your time So yeah, that concludes today's video on the beam at chemistry calculations There's quite a bit more to say on the topic if you're interested in a note You can have a look on beam and injure as I said they're available completely free of charge And I put a link in the description below So what have we covered today? Well, we talked about the three things that we need to do to improve our performance on the chemistry calculation questions Firstly, we should have all the formula that we need to know are the tips of our fingers So that we don't waste precious seconds trying to remember them Secondly, we should try not to be overly reliant on the formula triangle for moral conversion And finally, we should try and brush up on our mental and that skills remembering that in beam at chemistry The numbers are usually quite nice Which means we don't have to estimate too much and we shouldn't get frightened by numbers that look scary initially So thank you very much for watching if you like the video, please hit the thumbs up button If you'd like to see a bit more please hit the subscribe button and if you are taking the beam In really recommend you check out beam at ninja It's a little website that me and my friends made while we were at medical school and we'd love for you to take a look So have a lovely day and I'll see you in the next video. Bye bye
