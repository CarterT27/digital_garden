## Transcript
 Hey friends, welcome to the channel. If you're new here, my name is Ali and I'm a YouTuber, podcaster, and writer based in London. In a previous life, I studied medicine at Cambridge University, worked as a doctor in the UK's National Health Service for two years, but recently quit to do this YouTube thing full-time, which was a bit weird. Anyway, on this channel, we try and explore the principles, strategies and tools that we can use to help live healthier, happier and more productive lives. And the way I think of that is broadly under the five pillars of health, wealth, love, happiness, and impact. And so some of the stuff that we talk about is ways of making money through entrepreneurship, personal finance, and passive income. We also talk about productivity for normal people, for creators, for students. I also like doing a bunch of tech reviews to try and figure out how these various tech products fit into my life to lead to a health, happier, healthier, more productive life. And we also have a series called Book Club, where I do summaries and highlights from some of my favorite books that have had an impact on my life. If any of that sounds cool, I'd love for you to check out some of the videos, and if you look just underneath here, you'll find a playlist that has some of the most popular videos that people have resonated with over the last five years. But now, thank you very much for watching, and I do hope you enjoy the channel. Bye-bye.
