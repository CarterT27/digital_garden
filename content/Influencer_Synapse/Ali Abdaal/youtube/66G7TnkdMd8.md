## Transcript
 Hey friends welcome back to the channel in this video. I'm gonna be talking through why I have 12 full-time employees as a youtuber Mail them Mike test Mike test Mike test I'm gonna talk about my name is Tommy Hey I'm Bob. I'm done. My name is Seth. Hi. I'm a nurse. My name is Garth. Hi. I'm Tenton. So why do I have this many people working for me? Firstly, I'm gonna talk about the three top reasons as to why I have 13 employees Then we're gonna do the org chart And I'm gonna show you exactly what the roles are what they're doing and kind of why they exist And then the final part of the video I'm gonna answer frequently asked questions that people have always asked me around like what the deal is with all this kind of team stuff And as always, it's gonna be timestamps down below It's probably quite a long video so don't feel like you have to watch all of it feel free to skip around to the bits that are most interesting for you So let's start with a big question why and there are three main reasons as to why Reason number one is that hiring people has helped me free up my own time So for the first two years of running this YouTube channel from 2017 to 2019 I was doing everything myself I was doing all the scripting the filming the setup the editing the editing took absolutely ages and it was only two years into my YouTube journey That one of my mentors told me that hey at this point you should probably outsource your video editing because this was when I was working full time as a doctor And I was ending up spending Sometimes like three five Seven ten hours a week just editing videos so initially our first team member Christian was hired as a way for me to free up my own time and then over time As the teams evolved the sort of been basically three three things that I wanted to offload from my plate Number one is things that I didn't personally enjoy so like I said I stopped enjoying the editing after a while Secondly, I wanted to delegate over time the things that I was personally very bad at but then the third big category of things that I want to delegate is stuff where It is a kind of low value Action that I'm doing for example me filming a video is very high value because I am the only one who can film the video and it then creates a video on the YouTube channel which could potentially make loads of money through AdSense most of our videos are sponsored until we get money through sponsorships and so really the one main point of having all of these team members Is that they are doing the things in the business that are not sufficiently valuable for me to be doing myself Because I could be doing higher value things now reason number two for hiring people for what is Estensibly just making YouTube videos is that we want to do more things and we want to do better things So for example, we've got two full-time video editors on the team at the moment and that means we can put out two Pretty high quality videos every week if we wanted to get that up to three videos a week which we might do at some point We would probably want to hire a third full-time editor But alternatively, let's say I wanted to make my videos super full of animations and custom music and all that kind of stuff That's like trying to make the videos better and so we'd probably need to hire people to help make the videos better Now this applies to YouTube videos, which is the most obvious thing that you guys see But also the podcast for example, so we started a podcast about a year and a bit ago and because actually Organizing a podcast is a massive like logistical Fath in terms of Booking guests and contacting people that was the thing that we thought hey it would probably be worth having someone full-time to just manage the podcast to focus on that And really as we started to add more and more people to the team my own ambitions for what I wanted from the business Also started to increase to a point But if you've got a team of people where you're like a hang on I could just hire someone to be the podcast producer and then let's say we've got a videographer who can make the podcast look amazing And like an army of editors who can make the podcast actually feel amazing in the edit now all of a sudden Your ambitions for what a good podcast is get massively elevated by virtue of being able to Delegate the bits that you don't want to do yourself or the bits that you're not very good at to someone else So ultimately it comes down to doing more things and doing better things and then reason number three for having team members is just vibes It's just really fun people often ask me if there's anything I miss about working in medicine And I used to say that the one thing I miss was the banter with the co-workers But since getting my own team I now have banter with the co-workers I just don't have to do that in a hospital. I can do it in my house or in an office or in Lisbon Where where where we were for a team retreat last week if I imagine what is the sort of business that I want to create? It is a business that works with a small group of people regularly and in person and so yes, even if it does cost more in terms of hiring someone full-time in the UK in London and Then the cost of the kind of management side of things for me It's worth it because it's actually just way more fun and it's also kind of nice having people who are full-time employees who are then sort of wedded to the success of the business Compared to working with freelancers who have multiple clients and so really in any future business that I might make Sort of as an offshoot of this YouTube channel or outside of it I would always what I think I think I would always want to be working with people in real life just because of the vibes All right, we're just gonna take a quick break from the video to tell you about this video sponsor Which is very excitingly we work now we work you probably heard of it. It's the world's most famous flexible workspace provider And I've actually been a pain customer of we work for the last two years Me and one of my team members Angus started working from the we work in Cambridge during the pandemic at some point when workplaces were open and so that was an Absolutely amazing like sanity thing for not having to work from home all the time and since I moved to London I've actually gotten we work all access passes for me and everyone else on my team and what the all access pass does is that It means you get one of these we work cards and that means that on the we work app which is on your phone You can book a desk or a conference room in any we work anywhere in the world and so these days I work from home some of the time because I've got my setup and stuff here, but if I ever need a change of scenery I'll just rock up to one of the local we works It's really great vibes really beautifully designed that the heating is always nice and warm There's free coffee the bathrooms are good It's wifi super fast with way faster than it is at home often actually will just you know Rock up to the we work just to be able to upload large files every single person I've ever spoken to who's like I'm wondering if I should get a membership for a co-working space I'm like 100% do it we work is amazing So if you're interested in giving it a go you can hit the link in the video description or if you download the we work app and use the coupon code Ali a li that will give you 50% off your very first booking so you can try it out and see if it Vibble you as much as it does for me. So thank you so much we work for sponsoring this video part two What the hell do all of these people do This is the next big question people like you've got you've got 14 14 people 13 people on your team What on earth do all of them do so? And let's talk about that so our team is broadly spelled up into two halves We've got content squad and we have money squad and now the people in content squad their job is to help me try and make Really good content. We're trying to make inspiring educational content that helps people build a life that they love and then the mandate of money squad is to find a way to help Make the money that makes the business profitable and sustainable in a nice and non-scammy and not overly sales money kind of way So what does this look like so in content squad we have a chat called tinted who is our YouTube producer basically Tintin is my YouTube buddy my YouTube guy helps out with everything on the YouTube channel It's super handy having someone in that role because it means that like the thing that I personally enjoy doing is Taking a topic and then finding a way to synthesize and explain it in an interesting way. I don't particularly enjoy trying to figure out What's the most click baiti but not to click baiti title for the video? I don't particularly enjoy creating thumbnail for videos and I certainly don't want to be dealing with all of the kind of scheduling and Operational side of figuring out like which editor has which video and like are they being released on time? I also don't particularly enjoy looking at the analytics and seeing like retention curves and click through rates and all of that is the stuff that tintin Very beautifully magically takes off my hands the next member of content squad is Amber Is our podcast producer so the things that Amber does for example is that she came up with like the whole strategy around how we're growing the podcast Content strategy for the podcast Figuring out what guests we want to reach out to on the podcast actually reaching out to those guests Trying to do all the scheduling trying to book the main trying to make sure all the timings and the kindness fit Then once we've got a guest confirmed Amber kind of goes back and forth with them arranges the transport gets him to the studio wherever we're filming and then Amber also does some research for the guest or she delegates that to someone else that she's working with and we create this sort of dossier about the guest and some potential questions and avenues So that if I'm doing research on the guest, I can use that document and it saves me time And then once we film the podcast Amber is the one who kind of gets the footage and liases with Richard with one of our freelance editors For the audio edit the video edit figure figuring out what clips from the podcast We want to go into the trailer for the podcast and this like this whole sort of production machine behind something that sounds simple on the surface Like a podcast, but I actually feel like at any of these big podcasts out there They all have teams behind them. All right next on the team. I'm gonna talk about two people in like together But actually, you know, they're individuals and they have individuality and all that kind of stuff But for ease of explanation and that is Becky and Gareth who are collectively together in charge of Basically all of the social media platforms outside of YouTube at the moment Gareth is dealing with Twitter and LinkedIn and email And Becky's dealing with TikTok and Instagram and Facebook like having these two who are world-class experts in those platforms And who are keeping on top of all of the strategy changes and looking at what like competitors are doing And thinking of creative ways that we can put out content across all these different platforms That's another really important role on the team because yes the YouTube channel is sort of the main thing that we've got and by far our biggest Our biggest audience but across these socials We also have like a million followers across the other social media platform and like 250,000 or they're about on all of our collective email lists And so partly the point of growing across all these different platforms is a because that's where the audience is at like not everyone Is keen on watching 85 minute long YouTube videos and so because the mission of the business is to help people build a Lefty I love through inspiring educational content, you know, we don't want to be platform specific It's not it's not only that I'm wedded to making YouTube videos and so for example these guys are coming up with our short strategy Or a TikTok strategy or a like our Instagram strategy and figuring out how can we say the same thing But in a way that is native to the different social media platforms But then also the social media platforms from a business point of view allow us to diversify It's quite dangerous building a business that's entirely reliant on a YouTube channel Currently this business is almost fully reliant on the YouTube channel But if anything happened to the YouTube channel we at least then have these other social media platforms to fall back on as it were and if we could Potentially build our audience to be as big across all the other platforms as it is on YouTube That really gives a lot of longevity and diversification and anti fragility to the business And then finally it's worth shouting out the email newsletter or our email list because it's the only platform out of Everything that we've talked about that we fully control if we get someone's email address We can contact them whenever we want and so we've got my newsletter Sunday snippets You can sign up to it if you don't if you haven't already I said an email every week with like a few thoughts and a few kind of links to interesting things I've enjoyed or read that week and then Garth is responsible for like the strategy side the scheduling side Building a referral program trying to track all the numbers to make sure that like you know We're converting people from like social media audience to email subscribers the next member of content squad is in As who is actually a part-time member of the team in as works around three days a week and she is our researcher So right now and for the last year or so in as a night I have been working really closely together on research for the book that I'm working on In as has been amazing and like going down research rabbit holes and finding research to back up some of the things We're saying or if I've got an idea for a thing We want to write in the book then in as we'll see is that actually legit is this science backing this thing that I think is legit And a lot of the times you'll be like yep, you know, there's a bunch of papers to back this up But sometimes you'll be like well actually it's a good idea But actually the science isn't quite there to back it up therefore We don't want to talk about it in the book but in as also contributes to research on various videos Like for example, we had a sleep expert on the podcast a few months ago Russell Foster and so in as a number work together to figure out how do we turn his kind of podcast episode into an Interesting YouTube video and then members six and seven of contents squad are South and Addy who are our full-time Video editors so South is actually a former student of my part-time youtuber Academy We hired a South a few months ago and he's joined the team as a full-time member and he's often here in person and then exactly a month ago We also added Addy to the team and Addy's actually a video editor who's based in India in Delhi and Addy's amazing And he's you know completely smashed it with the recent video edits and then alongside South and Addy We also work with a bunch of freelancers who help with the shorts in particular now the final member of content squad I've also put a little bit aside because this is Dan now Dan does a lot of different things So Dan's role in content squad is that he's our kind of website webmaster website manager and so Dan's job these days is to Basically grow audience on the website. I think we get like A stupidly large amount of just monthly traffic on the website from people searching their name and searching for articles that we wrote like ages ago And so Dan is trying to work out a way of kind of optimizing the website making sure all the links work making sure that the website is fast enough And then figuring out a system to work with me and our researchers so that we can for example convert YouTube videos into Website articles, but the reason I put him in a separate box is because he also has another role in that he is also my executive assistant So he deals with any sort of emails and scheduling and calendar and stuff that I have to do Which is super nice for me because then I don't really need to check my own emails because Dan will flag up if there's anything interesting that I need to reply to But then Dan is also I head of legal and finance and HR the legal he liases with our solicitors to figure out if we need like employment contracts or if there's Trying to file a trademark or if there's anything that comes up that we need kind of lawyer consultation on in terms of finance Dan is the main person who talks to our accountants In terms of sort of keeping the accounts up to date the bookkeeping the Receipt tracking for expenses from very different various different team members and then in terms of HR So human resources again when you have employees you have got to deal with pensions and natural insurance contributions and tax and Contracts and time off and perks and benefits and all of that kind of Stuff associated with having full-time employees and so Dan is amazing and deals with all of that kind of stuff So then we come to money squad now the way our business basically works is that 99% of our content is completely free to anyone who wants to watch it or listen to it or read it on YouTube channel on the podcast across all the social media platforms across the email newsletter, but for 1% of our audience Who wants to buy it? 1% of our content is available as paid courses and so really we create this flywheel Where if we create load the free content and then some people buy the course and then that allows us to make money Which allows us to create more free content and we hopefully get this virtuous cycle going on Yacca bears our head of marketing and so he's basically the bridge between our contents squad and our money squad So for example when it comes to our courses, Yacca will be the one who makes the landing pages and tracks all that kind of analytics for them to make sure that we're doing the right things Yacca is the one who'll come up with our marketing strategy to be like okay How do we get sales for our courses? But do it in a way that's on brand and not scamming and not sales money Yacca is tracking various tracking links on the website to see kind of where it's traffic coming from and where is it going to? And then when it comes to actually marketing of course Yacca is the one who's sort of coming up with the strategy and a lot of the execution for like our email Funnels and scorecard campaigns and webinar funnels and challenge funnels and extra money squad We have Tommy who is ahead of sales and product these roles are a little bit influx because we're going through a lot of changes for a part I'm youtuber academy. We've been running live cohorts for the last like two and a half years But what's coming up in April is a very final live cohort So Tommy's been in charge of getting sales to that product and like hip-hopping on calls that people And answering their questions and seeing if it's the right fit for those customers But Tommy is also in charge of then creating our next series of products which we want to be evergreen courses Next on the team we have Alison who is our head of customer success So we have thousands of students in our part-time youtuber academy And we want to give them all an amazing world class experience and Alison's job is to make sure that people who are our paying customers are having an amazing time And so she does so much work on the back end in terms of making our course come together in terms of making sure everything is working And making sure that if anyone has any problems, they can just email us or message us on any of our platforms And we'll get back to them and try and help them out as best as we possibly can We always have some students who join our course who for example for whatever reason don't submit the homework assignments So Alison will actively reach out to them and say hey Johnny We notice that you sign up for the course, but you haven't yet engaged with any of the lessons Is there anything we can help with? Is there anything that's holding you back? What can we do to help you start your youtube channel or help you grow or help you get the most out of the course? And that's an absolutely huge role which Alison does a fantastic job of keeping things running And also hiring extra freelancers that we work with during our live cohorts like our student supporters to get feedback to our students It's a massive thing and Alison orchestrates that whole process behind the scenes And then we come to Bath who is in fact a former student of the part-time youtuber academy and Bath is kind of the operations manager The head of operations for all of the courses side of our business Bath is the one who's like plugging everything in behind the scenes and making sure that our zoom links are working And the calendar integrations are working and all of our no code to zap here or automations are working So that when a student signs up to the course they fill out a form that form takes the data from the student Transferze it into a spreadsheet or CRM that we can use to keep track of the students Makes sure that the system is sending them the login details so they can access the course materials Making sure that when they submit videos for feedback Those are being flagged and then being flagged or appropriate Students support team who are giving the feedback on those videos and now that our live cohort is ending and hopefully this is the final One that we're going to run in April. Barvest transitioning into more of an innovation role where she's going to work work very closely with me To basically dive into all of the different areas of the business and figure out how do we make this more efficient? How do we operationalize it so it frees up our own team's time from not having to do that minor mundane stuff and instead focusing on the big picture strategy stuff And then last but not least we come to Angus who is The general manager of the business. This is called different things in different businesses But Angus is basically the glue that holds all the entire business together Initially started working with me three years ago as a freelance writer and he started writing a few articles for the website And then he came on very quickly as a full-time employee and now has ascended to the ranks to basically become the guy that orchestrates the entire Duns and Angus is the main reason why I can be very chill while having such a big team Because if I had to manage 13 other people myself It would be an absolute nightmare and I would be terrible at it and it would not be fun But Angus basically allows me to live in the clouds where all I have to do is Filmed videos every now and then whenever I feel like it right my bookstuff go to conferences meet people do cool stuff And Angus is the one who's sort of keeping the troops in line and making sure the businesses are lined Making sure people are doing what they need to be doing they can show that he's unblocking people if they need help with anything And also Angus is the guy who negotiates basically all of our sponsorships because the over the last three years He's built good relationships and contacts and when I speak to other creators that are like oh my god You've got a team of 14 people that must be the worst thing ever. It's like it's actually really fun If you provided you have a really good general manager who is doing the day-to-day Management of stuff right part three of the video. This is getting very long, but if you're still here Thank you very much. Please do drop a like on the video if you happen to happen to be here We got loads of questions. I person on Twitter and a bunch of people asked various questions about what it's like having 13 14 team members on the team depending on how you count them So I'm gonna go through the tweets and answer some of the questions. This is gonna be fun. Firstly We have Michele Vargoose who says is each person a specialist or a generous Okay, so our editor's a specialist. Our editor's are actually six. I found out you're amazing Yeah, I'm a bit of a specialist in that we hired him when he was like a sort of had two years two Three years of marketing experience and in as is a bit of a specialist because she literally has a PhD Becky is a bit of a specialist because she used to be in PR and had done like digital marketing He type-stuff gariff is a bit of specialist because he had again like marketing and content marketing He type experience, but broadly we have a very young team like most of us are in our 20s and Broadly it skews more generalist than specialist specialist to me is like someone with 10 years of experience in like marketing or in sales We're in operations or you know that kind of stuff and initially it was a bit of an accidental decision to hire Generalists because I was a generalist and which ended up hiring various generalists and then over time It became a conscious decision because people kept on saying like you know working with coaches and stuff That hey for example Angus this is the only job he's ever had he sort of ended up becoming a general manager a Big question around Angus back in the day was should we allow essentially allow Angus to become the general manager of the business Where he's managing this whole team with zero experience versus hiring someone who has already has 10 years of experience of running a team Uh, sort of proper adult in averted commons in the business and there's pros and cons to both Thought about it for a very long time and I decided kind of ultimately philosophically in the end to that I want to run the sort of business where people are kind of promoted from within and You know growth mindset and leveling up and all that kind of stuff Angus has now kind of grown into that role that he was supremely Unqualified for and I think that's like quite a nice thing I also generally think that generalists are more fun to work with Tommy used to be our director for the youtuber academy Previously he did a law degree Worked in corporate law for a bit worked on Amazon for a bit worked at Google for a bit and then joined us as I'd you know YouTube Academy operations associate and then became the director and now is doing this completely different thing Because the business is so rapidly evolving and what is in one year is not in the next year And also I changed my mind a lot on a lot of things It's very useful to have people who are generalists who can adapt to basically any role of the given rather than people who would necessarily be super super specialised in In the fields all right next question from Rob O'Rourke is what's the right ratio of expenses and reinvesting Versus just taking profits off the table honestly. I don't know But a number I've plucked out of thin air is 60% so 60% other margins that we aim for I've again arbitrarily decided that A good profit to shoot for is 2 million pounds We're having that number came from and at those numbers we need to hit a revenue of around 3.3 million pounds 460% margins to equal 2 million pounds of profit or something like that But it's somewhat arbitrary because like You know super super super high margin businesses 90% margins 85% margins that kind of thing Those tend to be a lot a lot of those tend to be software businesses where you've got like recurring revenue Or you just have a very small team and very lean team and then like most traditional businesses sort of 5 10 15 20% margin seems to be the thing So I was like cool. Let's pick a good miller ground skew towards the high margin 60% field reasonable and in terms of like the 2 million profit thing is like Okay cool if we made 2 million profit 400k would disappear because of corporation tax so that takes us down to 1.6 I was thinking it kind of feels nice to put a million pounds into like an investment fund or something like that Why not let's plug that number out of thinner leave 600k which means I can put I can draw a salary of 250k myself for whatever reason and now we've gone out of 350 to put into property or into crypto All of these numbers are basically just plucked out of thinner one time and and that's kind of what we're going for So that's the the ratio of expenses to taking profits off the table that I that I think about all right Philippe Nunes says how not to inadvertently slip into a corporate mode with the team getting bigger Yeah, so I used to think that corporate was a dirty word. I was like oh, we don't want to do that because it's corporate But actually you know corporate is not a dirty word corporate is good like in the book unreasonable hospitality by Will cadera Who is like the restaurant tour in charge of like one one of the best restaurants in the world talks about restaurant smart and corporate smart and you can be restaurant smart or like kitchen smart If you're just really good at cooking or really got a hospitality and stuff But you also need to be corporate smart in terms of having systems and processes and you know the stuff that looks corporate And you just need to have a sweet spot between those two things and there's always a tension between those things The other day like last week we were all in Lisbon for a team retreat and we've realized that actually for the last few months Everyone's been filling out a Google sheet that tracks their KPIs they're keep a performance indicators But actually we'd been falling into a bit of a trap where the target of like at an 30 social posts on LinkedIn every week Became too much of a focus and we kind of lost sight of the bigger picture and realize that actually that target's not serving us So where do we have the target that was skewing too much towards a corporate side where you just do what you're told because you're filling out numbers on a spreadsheet But the solution there is not to completely scrap the numbers. It's to sort of tweak So it's all about getting this balance between corporate smart and like creative smart or whatever Start up versus corporate life and there's always like a middle way all right to Dan Bogecheck says what is your decision making framework for hiring? Back in the day my decision making frame for hiring was oh we have a thing we want to do let's hire someone to do the thing These days my decision making framework for hiring is oh we have a thing we want to do Are we sure we we are we absolutely sure we want to do the thing let's think about it for a while Okay, if we are absolutely sure we want to do the thing is there a way of doing the thing without like without using any People input is there a way we can create a system or a machine or an automation that does the thing that we want to do Okay, if not cool we need to potentially bring people into this is there a way that we can use our existing team and Kind of reprioritize other projects to make sure that we can do this thing that we want to do if not Okay, is there a way that we can do this thing by hiring a part time contract or freelancer to do the thing? Okay, if not okay fine, let's hire a full-time person So like what I've realized over time is hiring someone is not a decision to be taken lightly And the more people we add to the team the more the complexity of communication increases and the more things slow down So my model for decision making hiring is Do not hire at this point unless absolutely necessary I think in the early days of a business people with like zero people in their team need to be quicker to hire because when you start hiring It teaches you so much and helps you level up a lot faster But at a certain sweet spot Very quickly rather you don't start to make make those decisions very very very slowly indeed all right The whole chart says how do you ensure team happiness and has team productivity gone up or down as new members have joined? Okay, so team happiness this this is a thing we keep track of quite closely We do like anonymous surveys every few months We ask people how they're feeling we had a whole session with one of our coaches Eric Partaker on Thursday while we were in Lisbon Which was a whole session around what would make this the absolute the best place to work where every one of the team went around and wrote down and said What is one thing that the business does that? Contributes to it being the best place to work and what is the one thing the business could do which would make it even more of a best place to work or something like that So we we try our best to keep keep the team happy as a work But at the same time I try I also try and be mindful of the fact that There happiness is not my job My job is to give them clarity and to give them a role and to kind of Create the environment for them to do work that they proud of Happiness is a wholesale holistic thing that they are they that they are responsible for but I can at least do what I can On the work side of that equation to make the work at least as enjoyable as it can reasonably be and has team productivity gone up or down as new members have joined the first few hires are always Like way higher leverage than subsequent hires So it's like diminishing returns like at this point if we added a 15th person to the team There's almost no way that would boost up routine productivity overall compared to the difference between Person two in person three because when you hire three people suddenly you've trouble the amount of working can do now As if with a 15th person and we've increased it by about 10% or something like that as you have more people There are more things that people have to do to keep on top of communication with one another Working with each other all that kind of stuff and so one thing that I try and do to get around this is to make sure that everyone owns Something big and that everything big is owned by someone We only really have one person who's in charge of YouTube. We've got like one person in charge of the podcast We've got two people in charge of like six different social media platforms, but it's like three each It's like they've got they're very clearly defined areas of ownership because there's another phrase that I really like Which is that a dog with two owners dies of starvation all right Renee says how much are you paying in salaries altogether? They don't need to do specifics for each employee This is a good question. I guess how much we got how much we're paying in salaries this year So Angus tells me that we are paying about 740,000 pounds worth of salaries this year which includes natural insurance contribution and pension contributions for the 11 full timers and one three-day week person and one four-day week person But that does not include my own salary and final question. What are the challenges to managing that many employees? What are the biggest benefits? Okay bigs benefits. We've spent the whole video basically talking about this the leverage They're being able to delegate staff the vibes they're being able to find people who are better than me at doing the thing and then what are the challenges of Managing that that many employees Well, see for me is not that many because Angus is the one who's actually managing that many employees So I'll put a link to Angus's Twitter if you want to follow and maybe you'll write about the challenges managing that many employees What are the challenges? Number one. There is a certain sense of pressure So firstly there's revenue pressure. So for example, we're gonna pay 800,000 pounds in salaries this year and spend probably another of 700k in various other expenses That means our fixed costs this year are like 1.5 million. That's quite a lot. That means the business needs to make at least that much money for us to even break even and then more than that is profit. Thankfully We have a nice business that's well run hopefully with reasonable reasonable margins. So hopefully that shouldn't be an issue But it's always a little bit of a pressure. Secondly, there's just more things to think about So for example, if it was just me and a video editor and like a writer or something and an An insistent or something like that. Now, you know just a three-man team. We'll be making YouTube videos Maybe hiring freelancers for a few things here and there life is good When we start having projects that require a team of 13 people in total, especially our YouTuber academy Where now we're worrying about like our students happy We're worrying about like are we gonna get are we getting as many sales as we wanted to get based on our revenue Projections based on our profit projections based on our like head count costs all of that kind of stuff And it does add a level of Kind of complexity to the business and it means I sometimes have to think about that stuff Mostly when things are going along swimmingly I don't really have to think about it because anger such a manager deals with all that kind of stuff But when things are not thing well where it's like oh crap We've actually missed a revenue target That's when it starts to feel like right now I need to take myself away from doing the thing I actually enjoy which is writing and filming and Learning about stuff and teaching it into like right. Let's see where we can cut costs and that kind of stuff That's not particularly enjoyable. So there's like as always that kind of stuff that when the problems Start to arise and if those problems can't immediately be solved by angus or someone else in the team then I have to start getting involved I think another challenge is wanting to make people happy even then I said earlier that like you know my happiness is not that Is not there happiness is not my job. I still kind of feel it to an extent like if a team member is unhappy with their work I'll take it as a bit of a personal like oh shit like I'm sorry like you know Is it what they can do and I will feel a bit of a personal sense of responsibility that I want everyone who works with me to Feel really happy about their job. I don't know but maybe it's like if you have kids right if you have kids Yes, they're own person and stuff but like you do kind of feel responsible for them You're like you know, I don't want this kid to die. I don't want this kid to be unhappy I don't want this kid to cry and so if someone if one of the team members if it seems like they're unhappy I'm like oh, you know how can I help you know It's not like a bad thing. It's just like a challenge that not having team members just eliminates from your life But you know just like people with kids people with kids won't say like oh, I really wish I didn't have kids They might remodel about it very occasionally if you offered them the choice that would you go back and change anything They'd probably be like hell no. I love having kids Similarly, I love having the team. There's challenges. Sure, but broadly my life is more fun than it was pre-team and the business is more fun to be part of and to run then it was pre-team or final question from non-linear nodes are you happy? Very nice. Yeah genuinely I am I think I'm the happiest person I know um Alison one of our other team members says that she's also the happiest person she knows So she and I need to have a bit of a competition around that cliff one of my friends says that he's one of the happiest person He's the happiest person he knows so hanging hang out with some people that would rape themselves as such But no genuinely freaking love the life freaking love the business. I genuinely look forward to work on Monday mornings So I'm filming this on a Tuesday. Yes today. It was a Monday morning and I could not wait to get out of the shower and do my skin Caronel that kind of stuff because I just couldn't wait to get started with work And I think if I'd been on my own that would have been less of a feeling but because it was with the team It was just great vibes. We spent last week in Lisbon on a team retreat where we got loads work done and we also kind of managed to level up the business And that was super fun as well. It's just it's just amazing So if anyone is thinking of potentially hiring a team would 100% recommend but it's like you know the challenges along the way And it's definitely worth speaking to people who have done it before so that you can kind of learn from their Experiences but also you're gonna have to make lots of mistakes yourself. I've been so many mistakes over the last three years now of having having some kind of team But hopefully you know it's all it's all in favor of progress rather than perfection Anyway, if you really want to hear about the challenges of running a team you should definitely check out this video over here Which is a video I made a couple of months ago, which is all about all of the failures that we did in 2022 as a business We missed a revenue target by an absolute mile We make so many mistakes and all of that is detailed in this video over here all of my failures of 2022 So thank you so much for watching and I'll see you hopefully in the next video. Bye bye
