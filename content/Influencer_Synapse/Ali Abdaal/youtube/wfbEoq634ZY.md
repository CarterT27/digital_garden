## Transcript
 Hey friends welcome back to the channel in this video I'm gonna be breaking down all of the money that I spent in a standard week So I'll be taking you through my daily expenditure at work and on food and everything and then we'll talk about all of my bills How much are pay for the mortgage? How much are pay for all the various apps on my phone and my Mac and my iPad and all that stuff? I'll be breaking it down step by step and hopefully coming to a conclusion as to how much money I was spending each week for whatever that's worth I'll be honest. This is kind of a ridiculous video to make like why would anyone at all be interested in how much money I spent in a week But to be honest over the last few months, I've actually watched a lot of other YouTubers break down their weekly expenditures So I thought you know if I enjoy sitting on my computer and watching other people talk about how much money they spend Maybe other people would like to do the same for me Anyway, timestamps and stuff in the video description and in a pinned comment so you can skip around to whichever bit of this video most interesting But now let's just get started So our journey kicks off last Monday where I didn't have any patience to see in the morning and therefore I treated myself to breakfast at work And I got myself a croissant jam vegan sausage roll catch up in a latte all for the cost of four pounds and 10p Then after doing a bit of work things in patient savings and lives I got lunch and the hospital canteen as well and that was a vegetable lasagna with extra mixed veg and a portion of Brussels sprouts for four pounds and 15p At five p.m. I wanted to snack just before heading to the gym and therefore I got a cheese and tomato toasted Panini from the restaurant for the cost of £2.45 and then after work I went to the gym Had a cheeky spa session and then ended up having dinner at the gym and I got the salmon grill with sweet potato mash and some veg It would be spinach or chaos something about on the side and that was ten pounds 25 that evening I had a singing lesson from 845 until 930 and that cost me 30 pounds and over all I did about 76 miles of driving to and from work that day and at a cost of around 132p per liter of diesel and my car does about 45 miles to the gallon That is a cost of 10,17p therefore on Monday my total expenditure was 61 pounds and 12 P is this fun shall we keep continuing? Why not so next we've got Tuesday and on Tuesday I got a medium latte from Starbucks on my way to work and that was £3.55 That kept me full so I didn't need to buy breakfast at work But I ended up having lunch at work and I got a very healthy tuna in cheese melt toasty with chips and two sachets of ketchup For 4 pound and 20 while I was eating my lunch peacefully in the doctor's office One of my colleagues made some disparaging remarks about my lack of healthy eating and so encouraged me to buy this book From Amazon which I bought there and then because I'm trying to eat a little bit healthier and I thought this was a good way to do it And that was 11 pounds and 68p later that day I realized that I didn't actually bring my iPad charger with me So I had to go down to the hospital like grocery store and buy like a USB See charging cable for 12 pound 99 absolutely rip off but it had to be done and later that day I noticed that my lips were getting very dry and so I messaged my brother asking what lip balm I should get and he recommended But it's bees so again on Amazon primers bought two of these and these were two pounds in 99p each on the way I heard my stopped off at a grocery store to meet up with a fan from America and his friend and then bought all of us coffee So that was £6.90 and then after playing badminton at the local badminton club I stopped off at the same grocery store Saint's Breeze and bought 14 pounds and 36p worth of groceries Which included a ready meal that I could have for dinner that evening and again There was about 80 miles of driving so that's about 11 pounds of fuel so overall on Tuesday I spent a total of 70 pounds and 66p which for the Americans or international people amongst us is about 93 On Wednesday again, I got a Starbucks small latte this time on the way to work and that was £3.15 I didn't even spend any money at all on breakfast or lunch because we had this special simulation training day The hospital in lunch was provided which was fantastic but in light of that on the way home I got another Starbucks small latte for £3.15 and that evening I treated myself to a takeaway from GPK This was the Kevin Bear and cranberry chicken burger for 11 pounds 20 and I bought a side of Lumi bites which was £4.20 Again about £10.17 fuel costs to inform work and that day we had a cleaner who comes in once a fortnight And so overall the cost for me because I split it with my housemate was £12 So overall on Wednesday I spent 43 pounds and 87p which is $57.91 on Thursday for breakfast I actually had this puule which is really tasty and is about £3 per meal And then because it was a day off work I got another takeaway for lunch So this was another Kevin Bear and cranberry burger from GBK for 11 pound 20 I didn't get any side this time and then I was teaching physiology at one of the Cambridge colleges that evening So I bought some snacks for my students on route to the supervision and that was £8.7 worth of snacks and in total that day I drove around 14.6 miles to get to this college and back again So that was £1.92.00 Which brings us to a total for Thursday for 24 pounds and 19p which is apparently $31.94 On Friday I bought myself a Starbucks oat milk latte small latte on the way to work for £3.15 As my mid morning snack I got a croissant with jam from the hospital restaurant for £1.90 It's a Friday and so I got fish and chips from the again hospital restaurant which is fantastic for £5.50 And then me and my brother were driving up to the Cutswalls Which is a like national park in the UK to spend the weekend with some friends and so that evening I got a vegan burger from KFC for £5.89 And from WSMA we had to get some batteries so that we could record a podcast in the car If you don't know me and my brother have a weekly podcast called not everything You should definitely check it out link in the video description Anyway the batteries for that cost £4.99 In total we ended up driving 135 miles and that's a fuel cost of £18.40 And the Airbnb cottage that we got was about 24 pound 50 per person per night so let's add that on Bringing us to a total of a Friday of £63.97 which is $84.46 Then we've got the weekend so on Saturday morning we went out for breakfast in some nice Like hipster looking cafe in this like nearby this fancy cottage that we were living in Breakfast was pretty good I got myself this hash potato avocado tomato egg type thing along with an all-great tea for a total of £10 We kind of skipped lunch because we had breakfast quite late, but then we got some afternoon tea at the same cafe And I got myself a chai latte plus some toast and butter in jam and that was for a cost of £4.60 For dinner we went out to another restaurant had seafood stew calamari starters A lime and lemon drink thing and a chocolate brownie for £30 in total and again the Airbnb was 24 pound 50 Bringing us to a total for Saturday of £69.10 or $91.24 And finally on Sunday for breakfast we went out to the salad cafe I got a veggie bank robber meal for £7.95 I got some extra aluminum on the side for £1.50 and a 12 ounce latte for £2.80 Bringing the total cost of breakfast to £12.25 For lunch we were driving home so I got a £3.99 vegan burger from KFC I didn't get chips this time because I thought I was going to be healthy For dinner we had rice and oligourced made by my mum which was very nice of her But obviously that cost me nothing so I'm not going to include the cost of dinner But it was in total another 135 miles of driving so that's £18.4 P cost to feel which brings us to a total of £34.28 or £45.26 So that was what I spend on a day-to-day basis but I also want to talk about all my various other Fix costs are like the mortgage bills, broadband, council tax, all the kind of stuff And also all the money they spend on apps But before I do say you might be wondering how I've got the money to afford these like Ridiculous coffees and lunches and trips and all this kind of stuff Honestly the main reason for that is that apart from my full-time job as a doctor I also have various different online businesses that I've been building since like the age of 15 So when I was in secondary school when I was like 12 years old I taught myself how to code And I've been building websites and trying to make businesses sort of ever since and those Towards later half of my life ended up getting more successful than I thought and that ended up making me a little money And if you're interested in maybe learning that for yourself One of the best sources I'd recommend for learning how to code is a fantastic website called brilliant people Kind of sponsoring this video brilliant. It's an amazing maths science and computer science learning educational platform They've got online courses on all sorts of topics and the nice thing about it is that it's not just videos that you're Passively watching they've also got loads of exercises and interactive bits of it and animations And all this cool stuff they helped you learn the concepts easier and one branch of courses that I find really helpful are the computer science ones So they've got a really good course on the fundamentals of computer science like how algorithms work and how computers work and how coding like Works from a first principles understanding of it, but then they've also got a fantastic course on Python and Python is the world's most popular programming language And by going through the Python course and brilliant you can actually learn Python to a pretty good standard and you can do the interactive Problems to help you apply you're a knowledge of Python to different scenarios So then if you want to make an online business or a website or something you'll be able to use Python to do that and hopefully make money on the side of that's You're hobby if that's what you kind of want to do with your life Brilliant also has a great day you challenges feature where every day they give you this like challenge and they give you just enough information to Kind of solve the challenge, but you have to think about it a little bit and so often if I've got five minutes like on the bus or on the train or on the toilet or something I just go through the day challenges and I feel like it kind of helped exercise my mind So if any of that sounds up your street then you should definitely go to brilliant.org forward slash Ali and the first 200 people to click on that link Which will be in the video description will get 20% off an annual premium subscription All right, so now let's talk about the various life maintenance expenses that I've got so The mortgage that I pay is about 1,250 pounds a per month and then on top of that we've got about 200 pounds a month in terms of ground rent and maintenance fees Which is what you pay when you live in an apartment building like this one Thankfully the fact that I'm living with a housemate who pays me rent is really good because the rent as she pays Covers the interest on the mortgage and it also covers the ground rent and maintenance cost So essentially the money that I pay each month is pure principle It's going back into the value of the house is going back into repaying the mortgage and so in total Living in this house costs me 850 pounds a month, but I don't really consider that an expense because it's actually paying off all of the Principal of the mortgage There's none of that money that's actually going down the drain on interest ground rent and maintenance So I'm not going to be including that as my weekly expenditure But if I did that would come to £212.50 per week next we've got council tags Which is £90 per month just quite a lot which comes out to £22.50 a week We've got my gym membership which I share with my housemate and we pay £90 a month each for that It's quite a fancy gym. It's got like a spa and stuff and it's a it's quite a lot to be spending on a gym But I personally think it's totally worth it and the way just to find it to myself was you know Why wouldn't you value your health and you know being in it like being a member of a fancy gym encourages me to go to the gym More and I think that's going to be worth it in the long run But the gym costs £90 a month which is again 22 pound 50 a week for broad ban for high speed internet Which is 300 megabits per second download and 50 megabits per second upload It costs £60 a month and that's 15 pounds a week and I trust you and gas I split evenly with my housemate and for me that's 25 pounds a month So that's £6.25 per week the water bill is about 15 pounds a month so £3.75 per week my car insurance is unfortunately About 700 pounds per year which comes out to £13.46 a week and on average over the last like five years It's cost me about a thousand pounds a year to like various maintenance costs of the car like servicing and repairs and stuff So £1,000 a year comes to £19.20 per week So the total weekly cost of lifestyle maintenance is £102.66 or £315.16 If we're going to include mortgage slash rent payments and finally let's talk about all of the different apps that I spend What I thought was a large amount of money on but actually on my preparing this video and adding it all up I realized it wasn't actually that much so we got 15 apps on this list These are the ones that I can remember I do a search on my computer So firstly we've got day one which is a journaling app that costs £22.49 a year or £43 a week We've got tender gold which is £41.99 a year or £80 per week We've got Ulysses which is £35.99 a year or £69 a week We've got drafts which is £18.49 a year or £35 a week We've got to do it which is £35.99 a year or £59 a week We've got Castro plus which is what I use some podcast which is £17.99 a year or £35 a week Then we've got InstaPaper, £22.99 a year or £44 a week We've got Bear and no taking out £13.99 a year That's not too bad, £27 a week We've got hinge premium which is £27.49 for every six months which comes out to £1.5 a week And we've got Medium which is £45.99 a year or £88 a week Then we've got the ridiculously priced YouTube premium membership which is £15.99 a month or £4 a week And of course Spotify for £9.99 a month or £250 a week Nearly there we've got Evernote which is £4.99 a month and that's £1.25 a week And of course we've got Notion which is one of my favourite productivity apps of all time Which is £4 a month or £1 a week Then we've got the Adobe Creative Cloud which is £15.99 a month or £4 per week And it's totally worth it And then we've got my subscriptions to Skillshare, Brilliant CuriosityStream And a few other services that I'll subscribe to But I can feasibly get away with calling those business expenses So I'm not really going to talk about them in this video And so the total cost of apps is £18.70 a week And so adding all of that up, my daily expenditure Our fuel, coffee, food, takeaways, all that kind of stuff Comes out this week to £367.99 a week And so the total amount of money that I spent in this pretty standard week I mean yeah I went on holiday to the console for the weekend But I probably would have spent just as much of not more money kind of going to and from London And eating out all those times Anyway in this very standard week of work and having the weekend off In total I spent £488.50 which comes to £645 And if we're going to include the cost of mortgage or rent payments on top of that Then that £701 a week or £925 per week Now there's a few things in this that surprised me Firstly I was surprised at just how much it comes to in total Like even if we exclude the mortgage thing £488.50 a week that basically £500 a week And if there's four weeks in a month that's about 2,000 pounds a month that I'm spending Just just to survive with the sort of quality of life that I have And the scary thing is that my post-to-tax income from being a doctor recently has been about 1900 pounds a month And so about I'm actually operating at a slight deficit I was actually paying this a slightly longer amount of tax I was paying slightly too much tax And so now that that's corrected I think I will just about break even Or possibly be able to save maybe one or two hundred pounds Because I think overall my post-to-tax salary from being a doctor will be about 2,300, 2,200 pounds a month And I seem to be spending like in 1900 pounds a month Just on expenses which is a little bit much I kind of wanted that number to be significantly lower But then I started thinking like what's the cost of that number being lower Yes, I can save a lot of money by not buying coffee from Starbucks I could save about 23 pounds a week Yeah, I think I spent 23 pounds and 30p this week on buying tea and coffee out But to be honest, I get a lot of pleasure You know, when you drive an hour to and from work Stopping off at Starbucks at the halfway point to get myself a small milk milk latte Is one of the What are the things in life that I really enjoy? You know, I'm listening to podcasts on audio book on the drive to work And I get my latte and then I sip it while I'm driving to work It's such a nice thing and I wouldn't want to give that up for just three pounds And I've read a lot of books about personal finance In a lot of videos about it And I really like a guy called Remite Sethi's approach to this And his idea is that you don't need to cut out your lattes to save money Because if you make the big decisions Good, like if you reduce the interest rate on your mortgage or if you make more money or if you get it Pay rise These are huge decisions that really contribute massively to your bottom line Whereas cutting out a three pound and three pound latte here and there really doesn't actually contribute much Especially if that's the sort of thing that you enjoy And I definitely do enjoy spending money on coffee So I don't think I want to cut down on that I think one area that I haven't identified Literally as a result of making this video Is that I spent a large amount of money on food at the hospital And there's really no need for this And that's partly why With this new Joe Wix cookbook As sold by one of my superhero One of the senior doctors I was working with I really want to get into this whole cooking stuff at home doing meal prep All that kind of stuff But the way that I've justified it in the past has been that like man You know I'm working For for example I finished work at like nine PM today I let the house at seven in the morning I got home at like nine thirty PM And in the evening I'm filming this video Because I know this video needs to come out next week And so I feel like in that context I don't have time to cook for myself and clean up and stuff And therefore I'm totally okay with spending 10 pounds on a takeaway or 15 pounds on a takeaway Or five pounds having dinner at work Because I know overall the total value that I'm gaining in my life by the fact that I can make YouTube videos in the evenings Or not having to worry about food Completely outweighs the 10-15 pounds on an unspearing on takeaway So that's sort of how I've just defied it to myself So I don't think the economic argument for me personally works in terms of You could save so much money if you just didn't if you just ate outness I probably could but I think what is selling me is kind of the health argument And supposedly in this there's like healthy recipes and stuff And I know intuitively and like intellectually and stuff that eating healthily is like obviously a good thing And cooking for myself would obviously be a good thing It's like an absolute no brainer But I just need to actually find a system by which I can do it in a very efficient way And who knows once I start cooking for myself productively and efficiently Then maybe I'll make some more videos about that which might be fun And the third kind of surprising insight for me was that I never really calculated how much money I spend on petrol Fuel diesel and it cost me like 11 pounds a day just to get to work in back And so on average at work if I'm making 80 to 100 pounds a day like 11 of that pounds is going away on the fact that I have to get to work And then one amount work has spent about 15 pounds on food and coffee so that goes and then once you include tax and things And there's a lot a lot of expensive that I've got just by virtue of the fact that I'm going to work And obviously the easy way to save money on that is just live closer to work But I like the idea of living in Cambridge and you know this is my own place and I've got to set up and everything So overall I think it is worth it for me personally to spend that 11 pounds a day and that those two hours in the car Kind of driving to and from work But you know, it's not ideal as far as like a long-term life plan goes I'd definitely much rather be a lot closer to work So I think that's kind of the end of this video I've rumbled on a lot I hope you found that vaguely interesting if you're at this point I kind of imagine every anyone's gonna be watching to the end of this video and like watching me ramble on about my daily and weekly expenses But I want to make more videos about personal finance and I think it's a really important topic I've read a lot about it. I've seen a lot of videos about it things like investing and Compound interest and how mortgage is work and how you get a mortgage and how to save how to budget even though I don't do that very well I'm more of a fan of that, you know, like if you care about personal finance then it's a lot easier easier It's a lot more effective. I think to just earn more money by doing other things rather than to cut down and lose their expenses But hey, maybe I'll make some more videos on that So thank you very much for watching. I hope you have a lovely evening lovely day wherever you are If you like the video, please give it a thumbs up. If you like this video you might like to check out some other videos There's a video over there that I'll link there somewhere about answering some assumptions where I talk a lot more about money And how I've made money and how I feel about money if you're interested that sort of stuff Thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next video. Hopefully. Bye bye You
