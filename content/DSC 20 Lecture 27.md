# Continuation of Sets, Pytests  

> [!note] Unit Testing: What is it?  
> - Unit testing is the process where you test the **smallest** functional unit of code.  
>   - Single function  
>   - Part of the complex function  
> - If everything works correctly, then these tests should pass.  

> [!note] [Unittest vs. Pytest](https://builtin.com/data-science/pytest-vs-unittest)  
> - Unittest: built-in mechanism in Python  
> - Pytest: needs to be installed (`>>> pip install pytest`)  
>   - More popular  
>   - Easier (?) to use
