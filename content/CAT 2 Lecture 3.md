> [!note] Sensing  
> It all starts with sensing  
> Sensing starts with stimuli  

> [!definition] Stimuli (in the context of sensing)  
> Any type of energy that can be sensed by your nervous system.  

> [!note] Earth is full of stimuli  
> - Salinity  
> - Electric fields  
> - Magnetic fields  
> - Chemicals  
> - Light  
> - Pressure  
> - Osmolarity  
> - Temperature  

> [!note] Electromagnetic Spectrum  
> We can only see a subset of the electromagnetic spectrum, the visible spectrum (380-760nm). Some organisms can see more/less colors.  
> All colors are associated with wavelengths.  

> [!note] Organisms that respond to light  
> - Euglena  
> - Sunflowers  

> [!note] Organisms have genes that determine their visible senses  
> By looking at genomes, we can determine an organism's best senses.  

> [!note] The mantis shrimp  
> Has 12 (vs. 3 that humans have) different base colors that they can see  

> [!note] A majority of life lacks brains  
> 3 major modes:  
> 1. Food  
> 2. Mate  
> 3. Predator  

> [!note] Exteroreceptors & Interoceptors  
> exteroception: stimuli coming from outside the body  
> interoception: stimuli coming from inside the body  

> [!note] Theory of Bubbles  

> [!note] Jacob Von Uexkull  
> Baltic German who studied how animals think and feel  
> Published Umwelt(German for environment): combination of interoception with exteroception in the context of action organs  
> Umwelt is the world that you build for yourself  
> His theories are used heavily in robotics  

> [!note] Bubbles  

> [!note] Tick's Umwelt  
> Tick's sensory world  
> Ticks can wait up to 18 years until touch, temperature, and smell are present in its environment.  

> [!note] Human Umwelt  
> Action world  
> - Temperature  
> - Pressure  
> - Taste  
> - Audition  
> - Smell  
> - Sight  
> - Nociception  
> - Proprioception  

> [!note] Sound/hearing  
> Comparative Umwelten  
> Human 20-20,000 hz, 300m  
> Elephant 16-12,000 hz, 150 mi  
> Whale 14hz-120,000 hz, over a thousand mi  

> [!note] Imperceptibility  
> - Caffeine  
> - Climate Change  
> - Gravitational Waves  
> - Infrared light  
> - Pesticides  
> - Radiofrequency exposure  
> - VOCs (volatile organic compounds)  

> [!note] Art and sensory stimuli  
> Art starts with organization of sensory stimuli  
> Artists organize sensory input  
> Artists amplify and intensify sensory stimuli (Deleuze)  
> (Some) artists are engineers of the sensory world  

> [!note] Art CONTROLS what goes in your Umwelt
