# Getting Data  

> [!note] Obtaining Data  
> - Buy it  
> - Source it internally from your data  
> - Collect it externally from your users  
> - Freely download it from the web  
> - Request it from an API (paid/open source)  
> - Scrape it from a website  
> - Steal it (intentionally or unintentionally)  

> [!note] Places to find data  
> - Data is Plural  
> - Kaggle  
> - data.gov  
> - data.world  
> - census.gov  
> - us-cities.survey.okfn.org  
> - data.fivethirtyeight.com  
> - ucsd.libguides.com/data-statistics/home  
> - mkhosla-ucsd.github.io/cogs9/final-group-project/example-datasets  

> [!note] API  
> Rules for computer to computer interaction  

> [!note] Accessing an API  
> 1. Choose method  
> 2. Build URL  
> 3. Get Authorization  

> [!note] API Requests: HTTP Methods  
> - get: read  
> - post: create new resources  
> - put: update/replace  
> - patch: partial update/modify  
> - delete: delete  

> [!note] JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)  
> The most common method in which APIs return data  

> [!note] How to get API access  
> 1. Apply on developer website for API which you want to access  
> 2. Create an OAuth application  
> 3. Generate a token  

# Web Scraping  

> [!note] Basic Idea of Web Scraping  
> Websites -> Web Scraping -> Data  

> [!note] Don't Reinvent the Wheel  
> 1. APIs  
> 2. SQL queries  
> 3. Download button  
> 4. Web scraping  

# Ethical Concerns  

> [!note] API Developer Agreement and Terms of Use  

> [!note] Data Use Restrictions  
> Open Source  
> - Freely usable for commercial/private use  
> - Not usable for commercial projects  
> - Cannot repackage for reproduction  
> Not Open Source  
> - Usable for commercial/private practices  
> - Cannot release/make available  
> Lots of gray areas!  

> [!note] Mild-Mannered Web Scraping  
> Are you allowd to access the data/public?  
> Did you read the TOS? Does that exist? (Contact the website if unsure.)  
> Have you made yourself known? (i.e. put info about who you are in the header as a variable)  
> Are you limiting your requests? (Scraping in off hours, pausing between requests)  

> [!note] End User License Agreements (EULAs)  

> [!note] Considerations and Questions to Ask  
> - Where does the data come from?  
> - What are the usage restrictions?  
> - Does this data contain potentially sensitive information?  
> - If I publish results or a project using this data do I need to provide attributions/citations?  

> [!note] Important Industry Questions  
> - What data resources do we have?  
> - How is data moved between the above systems, what are the pipelines?  
> - Who has access to what data is in this organization, what are the data fiefdoms, who controls the data systems and ACLs (access control lists)?  
> - Who is/are the data champions? How do they communicate with everyone?  
> - What is the process for collecting/storing new data from external resources?  
> - What are the current data pipelines and what data is being used?
