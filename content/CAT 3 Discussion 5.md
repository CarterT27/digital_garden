## Review Essasy's Thesis  

- Remember that a clear thesis comes at the end of writing the whole review. It's like a conclusion that puts together what you are arguing  
- Think about what Wang Wei's poem means  
- Think about how the criteria you established conveys Wang Wei's intentions  
TODO  

## Road Map  

- Short paragraph between introduction and body of text that outlines what each paragraph is doing. Steps that you'll follow to prove your argument.  
- Example: First, I'll analyze "x" translation according to my criteria, then I'll compare "y" translation to "x" translation, finally I'll prove that "x" translation is conveying Wang Wei's idea in a more accurate way.
