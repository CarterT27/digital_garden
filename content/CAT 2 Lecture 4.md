> [!definition] Sensation  
> Sensation is the process where sensory receptors and the nervous system receive and interpret stimuli from the environment. It is the first stage in perceiving information, enabling us to experience sensations such as sight, hearing, smell, taste, and touch. Sensation involves converting physical stimuli into neural signals for the brain to process.  
  
> [!definition] Stimuli  
> Stimuli are external or internal factors that can elicit a response in a biological system. They are the elements in the environment that are detected by and interact with sensory organs, leading to sensations and perceptions. Examples of stimuli include light, sound, temperature, pressure, chemical substances, and even ...  
  
> [!definition] Exteroception  
> Exteroception refers to the sensory process of perceiving external stimuli from the environment through the sensory systems. It involves the detection of information from outside the body.  
  
> [!definition] Interoception  
> Interoception refers to the perception and awareness of interal bodily sensations. It involves the processing of signals originating from within the body, such as:  
> Interoception is crucial for maintaining homeostasis, the body's internal balance, and contributes significantly to emotional experiences and self-awareness. It allows individuals to understand and interpret bodily signals, which can influence decision-making, emotional responses, and overall well-being.

> [!definition] Perception  
> Perception is the cognitive process by which the brain interprets and makes sense of the information gathered by the sensory organs. It's how we recognize, organize, and understand sensory information, transforming it into meaningful experiences of the world around us.  
> Perception is influenced by various factors, included attention, expectations, cultural background, and previous experiences, leading to individual differences in how people perceive the same stimulus.  
  
> [!definition] Hallucination  
> Hallucinations are experiences where a person perceives something that isn't present in the environment. These can be visual, auditory, or sensory perceptions with no external stimuli. Commonly associated with psychiatric conditions, neurological disorders, substance use, or extreme stress, hallucinations are distinct from illusions as they are entirely generated by the mind, not based on misinterpretations of real external stimuli.

> [!definition] Illusion  
> An illusion is a misperception or misinterpretation of a real external stimulus. In an illusion, the brain constructs a perception that deviates from reality, often due to misleading or confusing information presented to the senses. Illusions can affect various sensory modalities, including visual, auditory, and tactile senses.
