> [!definition] Iterable  
> An iterable object is  
> - anything that can be looped over or  
> - anything that can appear on the right side of a for loop  

> [!note] Lists  
> ```Python  
> lst = []  
> lst = list()  
> lst = list("string")  
> ```  

> [!note] List Manipulations  
>-  Negative indexing: `lst[-2]`  
>- List slicing: `test[1:3]`  
>- Shrinking lists: `test[1:3] = 17`  

> [!definition] Mutability/Immutability  

> [!definition] Difference between plus and append  
> "+" returns a copy  
> Append mutates  

> [!definition] Tuples  
> Iterable data structure  
> Very similar to lists:  
> - indexing, can store different types of data, slicing  
> Immutable  
> Tuples with a single item: `("carter",)`  

> [!definition] Dictionaries  
> Allows you to associate values with keys  
> Dictionaries are now ordered collections of key-value pairs (as of 3.7, guaranteed to be in insertion order)  
>  Key: unique identifier (where we can find our data)  (can only be immutable)  
> Value: the data to find.
