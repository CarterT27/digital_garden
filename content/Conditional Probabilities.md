> [!definition] Conditional Probabilities
> Two [[Event|events]] $A$ and $B$ can both happen. Suppose we know $A$ has happened, but we don't know if $B$ has.  
> If all [[Outcome|outcomes]] are equally likely, then the conditional probability of $B$ given $A$ is $$P(B\text{ given }A)=P(B|A)=\frac{\text{\# of outcomes satisfying both A and B}}{\text{\# of outcomes satisfying A}}$$
